## Computing Real Integrals Using Complex Analysis

- Goal: compute 
  $$
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)~dx \text{or just} \int_0^\infty f(x) ~dx
  $$

- Summary of approach:

  - Use the fact that $\R \hookrightarrow \C$ as the real line, so this is equivalent to a contour integral along $L_R = \{ x + 0i \mid -R \leq x \leq R\}$ (i.e. a line integral)

- 

- For a half-circle of radius $R$ in the upper half plane, can be related

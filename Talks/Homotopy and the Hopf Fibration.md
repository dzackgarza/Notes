# Homotopy Theory and the Hopf Fibration

## Introduction
- Who am I?
- Link to undergraduate research


## Algebraic Topology
- Homeomorphisms and classification
	- Partition of $\mathbf{Top}$ into homeomorphism types
- Why it's interesting to study
	- Understanding + classification
	- Some practical applications
- The method of algebraic invariants


## Homotopy Theory
- What is a homotopy
- Homotopy equivalence of spaces
	- Partition of $\mathbf{Top}$ into homotopy types
- Weak equivalences

# Fibrations
- The homotopy lifting property
- Every map can be replaced by a fibration
	- $X \to_f Y$ factors through $M_f = X \times I \cup_f Y$ via a homotopy equivalence
		- See diagram for $M_f$, can also interpret it as the pullback of the endpoint map on $Y$, i.e. $Y^I \to Y, \gamma \mapsto \gamma(1)$.
- Fibrations induce LES in homotopy
- Modern categorical work:
	- Model categories, defined by weak equivalences and (co)fibrations
	- Generalizes both homotopy theory and homological algebra

## The Hopf Fibration
- Explanation of fibrations
	- Fiber bundles: cylinder vs mobius strip
- $S^1 \to S^3 \to S^2$
- Stereographic projection
	- Image
- Visualization: [Hopf Fibration Tool/Tutorial](http://philogb.github.io/page/hopf/)
	- Explain that this is stereographic projection from $S^3$ to $\mathbb{R}^3$
- Visualization: [Hopf Shader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MstfDs)
	- Explain inner torus
	- Explain larger space-filling foliations

## Interesting Results
- $\pi_3(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}$
- $\pi_4(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}_2$

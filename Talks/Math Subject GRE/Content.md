## Numerical Analysis

## Other Useful Tricks
- Commuting differentials and integrals:
	$$\frac{d}{dx} \int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} f(x,t) dt = f(x, b(x))\frac{d}{dx}b(x) - f(x, a(x))\frac{d}{dx}a(x) + \int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(x, t) dt$$
	- Need $f, f'$ to be continuous in both $x$ and $t$. Also need $a(x),b(x) \in C_1$.
	- If $a,b$ are constant, boundary terms vanish.
	- Recover the fundamental theorem with $a(x) = a, b(x) = b, f(x,t) = f(t)$.

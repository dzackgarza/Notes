- **Speed**
	- With 2.5 minutes per question, being quick is absolutely vital.
	- Quickly solving easy problems gives you more time on difficult problems, or time double check answers and/or be more careful on tricky problems.
	- Benchmark: aim to be able to do most Calculus problems in <1 minute. Simple limits, derivatives, or integrals should be on the order of seconds at most.
- Guessing:
	- Blank answers are wrong answers, so blindly guessing has higher expected value than not answering at all.
	- But note that because there are 5 choices, blindly guessing still has *negative expected value*!
	- So to break even (zero expected value), you need to eliminate at least one incorrect choice from each question.
- Choice elimination
	- It is tempting to thoroughly solve each problem you're given, but this is not always necessary.
		- Example: if you're asked to compute an indefinite integral, it may be faster to just take the derivative of all 5 answers to see which matches the integrand.
	- Use the multiple choice format to your advantage - they often have hints for what constants might appear in the answer, or hint at a technique to use.
		- Similar strategy to general GRE reading sections - look at answer choices *before* reading question, so you've already framed what you're looking for
	- If you eliminate 4 choices with 100% confidence, then the answer **must** be the remaining choice. No need to check!

- Practice Exams
	- There are 5 official exams out there (see reference section) with solutions.
	- Take all of them! Time yourself! All include scoring rubric to compute your percentile, so score yourself too.
		- Note: 3 hour exams can be mentally exhausting if you are not used to them. Practicing is essential to get your mental stamina up.
	- Note that all of the released exams are significantly easier than the actual exams.
	- Aim to complete practice exams within 2 hours at around the 90th percentile.

- Self Care
	- Applies to every exam - taking care of your mind and body pays dividends!
	- No all-nighters, no cramming - getting an extra few hours of sleep is immensely more beneficial than trying get a few more formulas tucked into your short-term memory.
	- Eat relatively healthy before the exam. Be sure to have breakfast the morning of the exam too!
	- Stay hydrated, drink water (but not too much -- remember, no restroom breaks during the exam)
	- Don't stress too much - this exam isn't a barrier, it is a chance to revisit a great deal of fun mathematics and show grad schools how far you've come and how much you've learned during your degree!
		- Note: I think graduate schools mostly just want to see that you don't totally tank this exam, because in many cases, grad students will be TAing the very courses covered in this exam. Also, remember that there are many grad programs that do not require the exam at all!

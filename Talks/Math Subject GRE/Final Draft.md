# What is the Math GRE?
- Difference between General GRE and Subject GRE
	- Content of Math section of general GRE (Quantitative portion):
		- Euclidean Geometry, basic Algebra (exponents, factoring, etc), Arithmetic (Estimation, ratios), Data Analysis (Graphs, tables)
		- Essentially everything before a Calculus class
	- Content of Subject GRE:
		- 50% Calculus (Single and Multivariable, ODEs)
		- 25% Algebra (Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, 'Number Theory')
		- 25% Mixed upper division stuff (Real Analysis, Combinatorics, Probability, Point-Set Topology)
- Purpose of the exam
- Who should take it, when, and why

# Logistics and Technicalities
- Usually offered 3 times per year
	- Around March, early September, and late October
	- Grad apps are usually due in early December, so you have 2-3 chances
	- Registration deadlines are usually 1-2 months before actual test date.
	- Might have to travel to testing center: for San Diego, SDSU.
	- Everything is done online through [ets.org](ets.org)
- Cost:
	- About $200 per exam
	- Fee waivers available that cut it down to $100 per exam
		- Easy to qualify, but requires getting form from website, getting some verification paperwork from financial aid
		- Takes **at least** 6 weeks to process, if not longer. Start early!
- Structure:
	- Multiple choice (5 choices)
	- 66 questions
	- 170 minutes (2h 50m)
	- Leaving around 154 seconds (~2.5 minutes) per problem
	- Final score: $\Sigma_{i=1}^{66} \indicator{\text{Question } i \text{ is correct}}$
	- Questions left blank are considered incorrect, but no penalty for guessing.
- Exam Day
	- Must bring photo ID. Don't forget!!
	- Not able to bring phone, backup, etc.
	- Must have confirmation/registration number or printed copy of email they send you near the exam date.
	- No restroom breaks!!

# General Strategy Notes
- Studying
	- Start early. Like *really* early, like at least 6 months before the exam.
	- Spaced repetition:
		- There are plenty of definitions, formulas and equations that are just worth memorizing outright:
			- Examples: The definition of a connected space, $\frac{d}{dx} \sin(x)$, $\int x^n dx$, solutions to ODEs of the form $ay'' + by' + cy = 0$, etc
		- But it's also helpful to have some methods and proofs memorized
			- Examples: Techniques for solving the nonlinear systems arising from Lagrange multipliers, the proof the differentiability implies continuity, etc
		- Flashcard programs like Anki are great for this, also just solving problems and then revisiting them regularly is perfectly sufficient to get them into your working memory.
	- A recommendation - just pick up Stewart's Calculus and go through the entire thing. 50% of the exam is Calculus, so this pays off! Use the chapter reviews as a diagnostic, use a solutions manual or Wolfram to check your answers, and drill into sections that you're weak in.

- **Speed**
	- With 2.5 minutes per question, being quick is absolutely vital.
	- Quickly solving easy problems gives you more time on difficult problems, or time double check answers and/or be more careful on tricky problems.
	- **Benchmark: aim to be able to do most Calculus problems in <1 minute.**
    	- Simple limits, derivatives, or integrals should be on the order of seconds at most.
- Guessing:
	- Blank answers are wrong answers, so blindly guessing has higher expected value than not answering at all.
	- But note that because there are 5 choices, blindly guessing still has *negative expected value*!
	- So to break even (zero expected value), you need to eliminate at least one incorrect choice from each question.
- Choice elimination
	- It is tempting to thoroughly solve each problem that you are given, but this is not always necessary.
		- Example: if you're asked to compute an indefinite integral, it may be faster to just take the derivative of all 5 answers to see which matches the integrand.
	- Use the multiple choice format to your advantage -- they often have hints for what constants might appear in the answer, or hint at a technique to use.
		- Similar strategy to general GRE reading sections -- look at answer choices *before* reading question, so you've already framed what you're looking for
	- If you eliminate 4 choices with 100% confidence, then the answer **must** be the remaining choice. No need to check!

- Practice Exams
	- There are 5 official exams out there (see reference section) with solutions.
	- Take all of them! Time yourself! All include scoring rubric to compute your percentile, so score yourself too.
		- Note: 3 hour exams can be mentally exhausting if you are not used to them. Practicing is essential to get your mental stamina up.
	- Note that all the released exams are significantly easier than the actual exams.
	- Aim to complete practice exams within 2 hours at around the 90th percentile.

- Self Care
	- Applies to every exam - taking care of your mind and body pays dividends!
	- No all-nighters, no cramming - getting an extra few hours of sleep is immensely more beneficial than trying get a few more formulas tucked into your short-term memory.
	- Eat relatively healthy before the exam. Be sure to have breakfast the morning of the exam too!
	- Stay hydrated, drink water (but not too much -- remember, no restroom breaks during the exam)
	- Don't stress too much - this exam isn't a barrier, it is a chance to revisit a great deal of fun mathematics and show grad schools how far you've come and how much you've learned during your degree!
		- Note: I think graduate schools mostly just want to see that you don't totally tank this exam, because in many cases, grad students will be TA-ing the very courses covered in this exam. Also, remember that there are many grad programs that do not require the exam at all!

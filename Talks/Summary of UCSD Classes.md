# Lower Division

- MATH 2. Introduction to College Mathematics (4)
- MATH 3C. Precalculus (4)
- MATH 4C. Precalculus for Science and Engineering (4)
- MATH 10A. Calculus I (4)
- MATH 10B. Calculus II (4)
- MATH 10C. Calculus III (4)
- MATH 11. Calculus-Based Introductory Probability and Statistics (5)
- MATH 15A. Introduction to Discrete Mathematics (4)
- MATH 18. Linear Algebra (4)
    - Description: basically the center of Mathematics because it's computable. Used heavily in any applied math setting and the theory/ideas are used heavily in pure math too.
- MATH 20A. Calculus for Science and Engineering (4)
    - Description: limits and the ideas of continuity, applied to the functions you studied in high school algebra/trig/pre-calculus. The derivative, its many interpretations, and how to compute with it. Overall, you'll learn how to "rigorously" work with tricky infinite and infinitesimal quantities. Maybe an intro to the integral and fundamental theorem of calculus.
- MATH 20B. Calculus for Science and Engineering (4)
    - Description: Applications of the integral (e.g. relationship between position/speed/acceleration, computing volume, work, or mass from density) and a lot of integration techniques. Brief interlude on sequences, series, and issues of convergence, maybe some *basic* ordinary differential equations.
    - Eric (Barrese)
- MATH 20C. Calculus and Analytic Geometry for Science and Engineering (4)
    - Description: everything you did in calculus, now with vectors (lists with components). Multiple independent variables involved now, so possibly partial derivatives and their applications (min/maxing a function, directional derivatives or gradients). "Double integrals", i.e. integrals over 2D shapes (i.e. what is the weight of an entire metal plate if you know the density everywhere?)
    - Eric (Eggers)
- MATH 20D. Introduction to Differential Equations (4)
    - Description: Basically everything in the real world can be described by a differential equation, i.e. how does it change over time? Essentially a bag of tricks for some common types of ODEs that come up in Physics, Engineering, Bio, plus other parts of Math of course. Takeway: ODEs are easy to state but can be *very* tough to solve - motivation for numerical analysis, complex analysis, and motivation for abstract linear algeba.
- MATH 20E. Vector Calculus (4)
    - Zack (Eggers)
    - Eric (Barrese)
        - Description: Original derivatives were $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, vectors gave us $\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$, now we want $\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$. Why? Want to integrate things like *vector fields* - e.g. how much light is bouncing off of a 3D surface, and in which direction? So now linear algebra and geometry come into the picture. Linear algebra becomes very important here, reinterpret the derivative as "best linear approximation", replace tangent lines with tangent planes/hyperplanes, etc.
- MATH 31AH. Honors Linear Algebra (4)
    - Jonathan (Sorensen)

# Upper Division

- MATH 100A. Abstract Algebra I (4)
    - Jonathan (Kedlaya)
    - Zack (Rogalski)
        - Description: linear algebra taught us that we can get a lot of mileage out of a small set of basic axioms, now we extend that idea. So we pick vector spaces apart, take 2 or 3 of the axioms to study in isolation and call it a group. Want to understand e.g. why the structure of $\mathbb{Q}$ with multiplication is similar to $\mathbb{Z}$ with addition, but vastly different from $\mathbb{Z}$ with multiplication (no inverses!), or how these all relate to things like modular arithmetic. Big idea: algebraic operations (iso/homomorphisms), how do disparate things relate to each other?
    - Note: Basically essential for grad school.
- MATH 100B. Abstract Algebra II (4)
    - Jonathan (Kedlaya)
    - Zack (McKernan)
        - Description: studied groups in first quarter, and usually rings/fields in second quarter - different algebraic objects with more structure, building back up to vector space structure. Most immediate uses: number theory (solve rational equations by looking at bigger spaces like $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}]$, $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is always a ring and sometimes a field, etc).
- MATH 100C. Abstract Algebra III (4)
    - Jonathan (Kedlaya)
    - Zack (Rogalski)
        - Description: Usually Galois Theory or Representation Theory. Galois Theory uses algebra to describe when polynomial equations have solutions that are expressible using "elementary" functions of the coefficients (are there analogs of quadratic equations in higher degree?). Representation Theory asks if we can encode group elements as matrices.
- MATH 102. Applied Linear Algebra (4)
    - Zack (Harel)
        - Description: how do matrices make our lives easier (computationally speaking)? Working with matrices that aren't invertible, interpreting transformations geometrically (e.g. projections), breaking complicated matrices down into simpler/standard forms. Motivation: systems of ODEs, matrix exponential, least squares, computer graphics, etc
    - Eric (Licht)
- MATH 103A. Modern Algebra I (4)
    - David (Popescu)
- MATH 103B. Modern Algebra II (4)
    - David (Popescu)
- MATH 104A. Number Theory I (4)
    - Zack (Popescu)
        - Description: what's up with prime numbers?! And can we understand difficult equations by factoring everything into primes? Diophantine equations (e.g. Fermat) are simple to state but extremely hard to solve, so we start building up theory to attack them. A lot of theorems about modular arithmetic and "multiplicative" functions. Pulls in techniques from everywhere (algebra, analysis, complex analysis, geometry, everything).
- MATH 104B. Number Theory II (4)
- MATH 104C. Number Theory III (4)
- MATH 109. Mathematical Reasoning (4)
    - Yi (Buskin)
    - David (Mohammadi)
    - Zack (Eggers)
    - Yuqi(Ben Chow)
        - Description: build up the logical processes and language you'll need for all upper div classes, which are based on proof instead of computation.
- MATH 110A. Introduction to Partial Differential Equations (4)
    - Zack (Behzadan)
        - Description: I said everything in the world was an ODE; slight lie, everything is actually a PDE. Even simple PDEs are hard, but good info for specific cases were worked out (heat/wave/laplace equations), all important physically. Motivation: Schrodinger equation described wave/particle behavior in Physics, and Navier Stokes describes things modeled like a liquid (like atmosphere, weird! or markets even.)
- MATH 110B. Elements of Partial Differential Equations and Integral Equations (4)
- MATH 111A. Mathematical Modeling I (4)
- MATH 111B. Mathematical Modeling II (4)
- MATH 120A. Elements of Complex Analysis (4)
    - Eric (Driver)
    - Zack (Snellman)
        - Description: Learn how to work with the complex numbers, and extend ideas from calculus there. Want to eventually solve integrals over lines/paths in the complex plane, these come up in Physics and Engineering problems (EE, fluid/heat flows, complex solutions to ODEs/PDEs can be easier, and everything in Quantum Mechanics is over $\mathbb{C}$). First hints of why topology is important!
- MATH 120B. Applied Complex Analysis (4)
    - Zack (Rabin)
        - Description: Lots of techniques and tricks to help solve complex integrals, and how to apply them. Intro to the geometry/topology of the complex plane/Riemann Sphere, interpretation of the complex derivative, analytic continuation, $\Gamma$ and $\zeta$ functions (needed to state Riemann Hypothesis!).
- MATH 121A. Foundations of Teaching and Learning Mathematics I (4)
- MATH 121B. Foundations of Teaching and Learning Math II (4)
- MATH 130A. Ordinary Differential Equations I (4)

    - Jonathan (Sterbenz...)
    - Yi (Elgindi)
    - Zack (Rogalski)
        - Description: What even are the real numbers? What is infinity? Attempt to essentially "support" Calculus with rigorous foundations, formalizing intuitive limit/infinitesimal arguments with things like $\varepsilon-\delta$ arguments. Start off by revisiting infinite sums and sequences and figuring out when they make sense, because we'll need them to define Riemann Sums. Ends with the full, formal, rigorous definitions of continuity and differentiability.
        - Note: essentially necessary for grad school
- MATH 140B. Foundations of Real Analysis II (4)
    - Jonathan (Chow)
    - Yi (Elgindi)
    - Zack (Chow)
        - Description: Some functions break integrals, and so do Physicists and Engineers, so we need a theory that explains when certain operations are justified. Motivation: solving some PDEs can be done not by finding *one* function, but a *sequence* of functions where the limit is the actual solution - but is that limiting function differentiable? Or even continuous? Also, things like the Weierstrass function exist: everywhere continuous, nowhere differentiable ![the Weierstrass function](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/WeierstrassFunction.svg/795px-WeierstrassFunction.svg.png)
- MATH 140C. Foundations of Real Analysis III (4)
    - Jonathan (Saab)
    - Zack (Ioana)
        - Description: multivariable extensions of the previous ideas, plus measure theory and the Lebesgue integral. Motivation: measure theory is the foundation of probabilty, and the Lebesgue integral has many better properties for proving theorems, inequalities, integrating weird functions, etc.

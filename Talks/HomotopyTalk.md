**Definition (Homotopy Equivalence)**
Two spaces $X, Y$ are said to be *homotopy equivalent* if there exists a maps $f: X \to Y$ and $f\inv: Y \to X$ such that
$$
f\circ f\inv \homotopic \id_Y \\
f\inv \circ f \homotopic \id_X
$$

**Definition (Weak Equivalence)**
A continuous map
$$
f: X \to Y 
$$
is called a *weak homotopy equivalence* if the induced map
$$
f_*: \pi_*(X) \to \pi_*(Y)
$$
is a graded isomorphism.

> Note that this is a strictly weaker notion than homotopy equivalence -- we don't require an explicit inverse.

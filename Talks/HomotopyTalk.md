**Definition (Cellular Map)**

**Definition (Homotopy Equivalence)**
Two spaces $X, Y$ are said to be *homotopy equivalent* if there exists a maps $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to X$ such that
$$

$$

**Definition (Weak Equivalence)**
A continuous map
$$
f: X \to Y 
$$
is called a *weak homotopy equivalence* if the induced map
$$
f_*: \pi_*(X) \to \pi_*(Y)
$$
is a graded isomorphism.

> Note that this is a strictly weaker notion than homotopy

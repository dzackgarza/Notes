# Annotated Bibliography: Contemporary Social Issues

## Proposal

The goal of this project will be to critically examine the role of academia in the modern world, particularly in light of increasing globalization, the democratization of information, and the proliferation of trade and technical programs. Whereas in previous generations, higher education played a key role in obtaining the type of white collar work that generally sustained middle-class societies, a profileration of trade and technical programs, combined with the increased costs and lower returns associated with a college degree, academic institutions now find themselves subject to the often competing pressures to both prepare students with the skills necessary for future jobs, while simultaneously imparting students with a broad, liberal education. The role of these institutions is particularly important in a society where higher-education is heralded as a tool of economic and social mobility. These institutions also serve the critical role of conducting fundamental research, which serves many long-term civic and societal needs, and results in intricate ties between the education system, legislation, and political policy making. Finally, the education system also fulfills a very humanitarian need, to teach new generations about both the great accomplishments and great mistakes of the past, paving the way for a society that incrementally improves generation by generation.

## Bibliography

Put in ABC order, at least 3 sources

- Acedo, Clementina, et al. *Quality and qualities: tensions in education reforms*. Sense, 2012. 
  - This paper lays out some of the groundwork of what constitutes "quality" in education, which will serve as an important baseline against which comparisons can be made. It also discusses certain cases of education reform, using case studies from Argentina, Venezuela, and Malaysia. It also discusses the interplay between education and education policy, particularly reforms and national standards, and their relative successes/failures in these cases.
- Altbach, Philip G. *The international imperative in higher education*. Sense Publishers, 2014. 
  - This source discusses the transitional period that higher education currently finds itself in, and explores the relations between universities and state/national governments, and lends an international viewpoint by discussing the state of education in China and India. It discusses many pertinent issues relevant to both students and educators, including the effects of new technologies, the structures of university employee systems, the use of rankings, and the issues surrounding the transfer of human knowledge. 
- Kariwo, Michael, et al. *Comparative analysis of higher education systems: issues, challenges and dilemmas*. Sense, 2014. 
  - This source offers a wider perspective on the challenges facing education, expanding the narrative beyond Europe and the United States to include Africa, Latin America, Russia, Asia, and more. It particularly highlights the "balancing act" that modern universities are expected to maintain in order to meet various competing needs from communities, governments or state actors, and the world at large. A particularly insightful viewpoint that it offers is a discussion of how markets have become increasingly "knowledge-based" over time, leaving a void for many skilled workers that the education system is expected to fill and alleviate. It also broaches several salient topics, such as problematic artifacts of an overpopulated system, such as diversity "quotas", as well as issues of access and quality related to relative privilege.
- Rothman, Stanley, et al. *The still divided academy: how competing visions of power, politics, and diversity complicate the mission of higher education.* Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2011. 
- *University in the age of globalization: rankings, resources and reforms*. Palgrave Macmillan, 2014.



# Notes

- Use 1" margins, 12 point font in Arial or Times New Roman? Double space?
- Number your pages?
- Give full citations for all of your sources (including publisher and publishing city)?
- Format your paper in an outline format as given in TritonEd?
- Use at least 3 scholarly sources?
- Submit the paper to TurnItIn on TritonEd? (If it is not submitted into Safe Assign within 24 hours of the due date/time, you will be given a zero)

This is meant to set you up for your Contemporary Social Issue Project due at the end of the quarter. This Annotated Bibliography is the “research” component. Since, once you choose a topic, you need to consult research about it. 

Here, you will outline your proposal (your ‘thesis’) and let me know what book sources you are planning to consult for the research paper part of the project that you are presenting in class. This will allow me to stop you from using an author that is not a good fit. 

Please make sure all are scholarly sources, meaning that experts in the field write them. If you need a visual, see the next two pages for an example of one that I did in graduate school. You may not use the Foner textbook as one of your 3 sources.

For this project you may notice that you do not have a minimum word or page requirement. You know how much information you need to provide me with so that I can get a good sense of your selected book sources and how they relate to your selected topic. If you are unsure that you have written enough, email me. **I would aim for 12-15 sentences per source.** 

You will need a proposal paragraph, full citation of the sources that you want to include, and descriptions of those books. When you get this project back, you will be able to tell if you are on the right track toward starting your final paper. If not, improve it, seek additional help (myself or the Writing Lab) so that when you get to the big final paper it will be easier on you.

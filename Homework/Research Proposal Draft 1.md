# Research Proposal: Draft 1

The question I will be exploring is this proposal revolves around an examination of graffiti and street art, and the duality of the modern perception of these art forms as countercultural expressions in some contexts, while simultaneously acceptable and even valued in other contexts. In particular, I would like to examine the cultural, ethnic, and economic conditions surrounding different types street art, and how these play a role in its perception as either an illicit activity or an expression of high art. In order to investigate these issues, I will specifically be focusing on Latin American and Chicano works of street art.

This question is important to address because it is a unifying theme that helps bring to light issues of cultural representation, identity, and potentially appropriation. A common theme brought up by sources that speak to these issues is the fact that in many parts of the United States, Latin Americans are no longer a minority population, and thus their cultural productions are a vital component of what would be considered a modern "American" identity. There are also strong arguments that their contributions, particularly in the world of art, are often devalued and excluded from the American mainstream, while simultaneously having a profound influential impact on it. 

Moreover, in recent years, there has been a dramatic shift in the perception of street art. Although still considered an act of vandalism and punishable by law in many areas, it is not uncommon to see such works in galleries, either decontextualized from its original medium or as the result of more socially acceptable avenues of production. Thus another facet of this topic is how these works have been commoditized and have even been privy to commercial success. This is particularly interesting when contrasted against the ephemeral nature of street art, by virtue of its illegality, as well as its obliquely public nature of the original media and the economic status surrounding its genesis. By exploring these topics, I hope to learn more about whether or not this process harms either the overall quality, integrity, and purpose of the art form, and whether recent shifts towards commodification of the style have displaced the  original creators and the messages they hoped to communicate.

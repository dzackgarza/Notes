This page contains links to resources I have found useful in the past. I've tried to roughly organize these by increasing complexity with respect to a typical undergraduate degree in Mathematics.

Items that are marked with a :star: are (in my opinion) particularly excellent resources to peruse in just about any circumstance.

# Advice for Incoming Math Majors
- Start thinking about whether or not grad school as an option. You don't have to *decide* within your first year, but you'll want to pick courses accordingly.
- Get an idea of what Math is all about - there are great things beyond Calculus!
	- To get an idea of what you're in for as a Math major, take a look at the GRE Mathematics Subject Exam. It covers a broad array of pretty standardized topics.
	- Also take a look Garrity's book ([linked in the resources section](#garrity)) for a short, condensed survey of some of the major topics and theorems you'll encounter.
	- One thing that was helpful to me was to make [graphs and diagrams](/world-of-math) of different areas of Math I encountered. Take a look, knowing the landscape you're traversing is valuable.
- Learn Latex and Mathjax early, and then make efforts regularly typeset your written notes.
- It may be intimidating, but try to find ways to talk to your professors outside of class! Don't hesitate to ask for advice on just about anything related to Math or your academic career, in my experience they are always happy to help.

Here are what I would consider some of the essential, core classes that are relatively standard for people majoring in pure Math and aiming for grad school:
- All of the Calculus (of course)
- Linear Algebra
- Ordinary Differential Equations
- Abstract Algebra
- Real Analysis
- Point-Set Topology

Here are some "nice-to-haves" -- still important, still beautiful, and great electives, but missing out on them probably won't immediately tank your application:
- Probability
- Combinatorics
- Complex Analysis
- Number Theory
- Discrete Math (e.g. Graph Theory)
- More Linear Algebra (e.g. Numerical Analysis)

Of course, it's important to explore a large variety of classes and find what you like. The ideas and concepts from these courses are quite prevalent in just about every subfield of Mathematics, so having them under your belt makes life much easier regardless of what you pursue.

# General Notes on Resources
- Anything lower-division: Khan Academy.
- Video lectures in general: they are a crutch! Use them to supplement and enrich your understanding, they are not as effective as a primary learning source. Your primary resource should always be material from your own instructor and course. Passively watching is also not very helpful - take notes, write down timestamps and video titles for important topics, and don't be afraid to rewatch these several times.
- Youtube videos and lectures: vary in quality, but you can watch at 2x speed.
- MIT OCW: when video lectures are available, generally high quality. Covers a good number of areas, and a good source of practice problems and exams.
- Look for book recommendations for your topic/class in places like Math StackExchange or MathOverflow, and don't be afraid to consult multiple books on the same topic.
- If you find an author/lecturer/general source that you particularly like or makes much more sense to you than others, look up other things from that source. If they cover other topics, be open to learning those -- Math is quite interrelated, and later topics will be easier to learn if you are well-versed in earlier topics and have a bag of concepts you can "hang your hat on".
- For lower division or introductory courses that aren't proof-based, try to obtain a textbook along with its accompanying solutions manual. This is a great way to drill problems, check your answers, and identify your weaknesses.
- General tip: don't both with sites like Chegg.
- Learn how to use a Computer Algebra System (CAS) early! Don't use it as a crutch - just learn enough syntax so that you can quickly compute sanity checks. [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/) is a good for quick things. If you have the time, learn something like  [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/index.html), which can do symbolic computations and can even be used for things like group theory and algebra.


# General Advice on Learning
- **Vocabulary**: for any new topic, it can be helpful to make a list of definitions and simply memorize them. Math is (at least partially) a language, so it is worth (partially) learning it like one!
- **Start everything early**, Mathematics is more like a marathon than a sprint.
- **Work a lot of problems/proofs**, more than you are assigned. But be judicious with your time! If you stare at a problem for more than an hour or two without making progress, pivot. Sometimes the best way to make progress on a problem is to take a break, work on something different, or sleep on it. A relevant quote from Alexander Grothendieck:
	>I can illustrate the approach with the image of a nut to be opened. The first analogy that came to my mind is of immersing the nut in some softening liquid, and why not simply water? From time to time you rub so the liquid penetrates better, and otherwise you let time pass. The shell becomes more flexible through weeks and months â€” when the time is ripe, hand pressure is enough, the shell opens like a perfectly ripened avocado!
- **Use a wide variety of resources**: books, lectures, notes, PDFs, use them all. The google search modifiers `inurl:edu filetype: pdf` are incredibly useful.
- **Extensively use good resources**: there is also some value in working a single, particularly well-regarded book, front to back.
- **Spaced repetition**: read up on it, and work it into your study habits. Cramming has diminishing returns in proof-based classes, you are much better served by visiting and revisiting material often enough to be familiar with it.
- **Sleep like it is your hobby.** Two hours of extra sleep is almost always a more efficient use of your time than two hours of tired studying.

# Specific Advice on Learning Mathematics
- **Use multiple books**: For most undergraduate topics, there are many "standard" references. Use them all! Cross-reference liberally as well.
- **Get the definitions down cold**: Record every single definition you come across and just do whatever you have to do to memorize them! Some people like flash cards, I personally make a "dictionary" document for each subject. Meaning and understanding is often a gradual process, but knowing the full statement of a definition should just be automatic. I like to think of definitions as the analog "multiplication tables" within higher Mathematics -- is it essential to memorize? Well no, but you also wouldn't want to waste time stopping to multiply out $12^2$ when you're trying to solve an integral.
- **Synthesize often:** This includes things like revising class notes, making your own "cheat sheets", writing up explanations of particular theorems or motivations for certain concepts, etc. Even better, find ways to give talks or teach other people! Present things as if you were trying to teach yourself the topic 6-12 months in the past.
- **Google for PDF notes**: For just about any topic at any level of specificty, someone has probably written up notes or expository explanations and shared them online. So it can be extremely beneficial to look through the first page or two of Google results using `filetype:pdf` for any concept or proof you happen to be studying and see how other mathematicians think about and present them.

# General Resources

## Math Subject GRE

If you are thinking about applying to graduate school in Mathematics (pure or applied), I would recommend that you start looking at the material for this exam within your first few years, and take it during your Junior year.

This is because these tests are only offered twice per year, and you often won't get your scores until late in the grad school application process - so if you want to retake and improve your score, you could delay your application by nearly a year. Yikes! Take it early, just in case.

- Single Variable Calculus (x%)
- Multivariable Calculus (x%)

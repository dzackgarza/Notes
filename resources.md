# Advice

## For Incoming Math Majors
- Start thinking about whether or not grad school as an option. You don't have to *decide* within your first year, but you'll want to pick courses accordingly.
- Get an idea of what Math is all about - there are great things beyond Calculus!
	- To get an idea of what you're in for as a Math major, take a look at the GRE Mathematics Subject Exam. It covers a broad array of pretty standardized topics.
	- Also take a look Garrity's book ([linked in the resources section](#garrity)) for a short, condensed survey of some of the major topics and theorems you'll encounter.
	- One thing that was helpful to me was to make [graphs and diagrams](/world-of-math) of different areas of Math I encountered. Take a look, knowing the landscape you're traversing is valuable.
- Learn Latex and Mathjax early, and then make efforts regularly typeset your written notes.
- It may be intimidating, but try to find ways to talk to your professors outside of class! Don't hesitate to ask for advice on just about anything related to Math or your academic career, in my experience they are always happy to help.
- For those aiming for grad school, particularly in pure Math: here are what I would consider some of the most essential, core classes to take:
	- Calculus (of course)
	- Linear Algebra
	- Ordinary Differential Equations
	- Abstract Algebra
	- Real Analysis
	- Point-Set Topology

	Here are some "nice-to-haves" -- still important, still beautiful, and great electives, but missing out on them in undergrad isn't the end of the world:
	- Probability
	- Combinatorics
	- Complex Analysis
	- Number Theory
	- Discrete Math (e.g. Graph Theory)
	- More Linear Algebra (e.g. Numerical Analysis)

	Of course, I recommend taking as many Math courses as possible -- explore the subject and discover what you like! But the ideas and concepts from these particular courses are relevant to just about any area you might go into, so having some exposure to them makes life much easier (regardless of what you pursue).


## On Learning and Being a Student
- **Start everything early**: Starting early gives you time to mull over questions and potentially visit professors/TAs for help.
- **Use a wide variety of resources**: Books, lectures, notes, PDFs -- use them all! The search modifiers `inurl:edu filetype:pdf` on Google are incredibly useful.
- **Extensively use good resources**: There is also some value in working a single, particularly well-regarded book, front to back.
- **Spaced repetition**: read up on it, and work it into your study habits. Cramming has diminishing returns in proof-based classes, you are much better served by visiting and revisiting material often enough to be familiar with it.
- **Sleep like it is your hobby.** Two hours of extra sleep is almost always a more efficient use of your time than two hours of tired studying.

## On Learning Mathematics Specifically
- **Vocabulary**: for any new topic, it can be helpful to make a list of definitions and simply memorize them. Math is (at least partially) a language, so it is worth (partially) learning it like one!
- **Use multiple books**: For most undergraduate topics, there are many "standard" references. Use them all! Cross-reference liberally as well.
- **Get the definitions down cold**: Record every single definition you come across and just do whatever you have to do to memorize them! Some people like flash cards, I personally make a "dictionary" document for each subject. Meaning and understanding is often a gradual process, but knowing the full statement of a definition should just be automatic. I like to think of definitions as the analog "multiplication tables" within higher Mathematics -- is it essential to memorize? Well no, but you also wouldn't want to waste time stopping to multiply out $12^2$ when you're trying to solve an integral.
- **Synthesize often:** This includes things like revising class notes, making your own "cheat sheets", writing up explanations of particular theorems or motivations for certain concepts, etc. Even better, find ways to give talks or teach other people! Present things as if you were trying to teach yourself the topic 6-12 months in the past.
- **Google for PDF notes**: For just about any topic at any level of specificty, someone has probably written up notes or expository explanations and shared them online. So it can be extremely beneficial to look through the first page or two of Google results using `filetype:pdf` for any concept or proof you happen to be studying and see how other mathematicians think about and present them.
- **Work a lot of problems/proofs**: Do more than you are assigned, but be judicious with your time! If you stare at a problem for more than an hour or two without making progress, pivot. Sometimes the best way to make progress on a problem is to take a break, work on something different, or sleep on it. A relevant quote from Alexander Grothendieck:
	>I can illustrate the approach with the image of a nut to be opened. The first analogy that came to my mind is of immersing the nut in some softening liquid, and why not simply water? From time to time you rub so the liquid penetrates better, and otherwise you let time pass. The shell becomes more flexible through weeks and months â€” when the time is ripe, hand pressure is enough, the shell opens like a perfectly ripened avocado!



# Math Course Resources

## General Notes on Resources
- Anything lower-division: [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/).
- On Youtube videos: more and more lectures and talks are being posted online. These vary in quality, but this if offset by the fact that you can watch them at 2x speed.
- On video lectures in general: they are a crutch! Use them to supplement and enrich your understanding, but they do not work well as primary resources. The best resources are always materials from your own instructors and courses. Passively watching videos is also not very helpful - take notes, write down timestamps and video titles for important topics, and don't hesitate to rewatch several times.
- [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm): when video lectures are available, generally high quality. Covers a good number of areas, and a good source of practice problems and exams.
- Look for book recommendations for your topic/class in places like Math StackExchange (MSE) or MathOverflow (MO), and don't be afraid to consult multiple books on the same topic. I've had very good luck following the  [reference-request tags](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-request) on these sites.
- If you find an author/lecturer/general source that you particularly like, look up other things from that source! If they cover other topics, be open to learning those -- Math is quite interrelated, and later topics will be easier to learn when you have a collection of concepts you can "hang your hat on".
- For lower division or introductory courses, try to obtain a textbook paired with a solutions manual. This is a great way to drill problems, check your answers, and identify your weaknesses. Beware typos!
- Don't both with sites like Chegg.
- For computational courses: Schaum's Outlines can be useful, but the quality is _very_ subject-dependent.
- Learn how to use a Computer Algebra System (CAS). Don't use it as a crutch - just learn enough syntax so that you can quickly run "sanity checks" on your computations. [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/) is a good for quick things. If you have the time, learn something like [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/index.html), which can do symbolic computations and can even be used for things like group theory and algebra.

Below are resources for specific courses/subjects; I've tried to roughly organize these by increasing complexity with respect to a typical undergraduate Math degree.

## Single Variable Calculus
- :fa-book: _Stewart_, [Calculus: Early Transcendentals](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0538497904/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0538497904&linkId=edb74b5594ddb68399ffe86972c7eb84)
	- What can I say? It's a Calculus book, and it covers the standard curriculum. This one's a good choice because there are a few solution manuals floating around for older editions.
- :fa-book: _Spivak_, [Calculus](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0914098918/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0914098918&linkId=6e5af9b5340ff7f74c580ed8869d31f9)
	- Exposition is a little more advanced, and closer to introductory real analysis. Good for an honors-level course, or if you want to see a more "rigorous" exposition of the topics from Stewart.
- :fa-book: _Apostol_, [Calculus, Vol. 1: One-Variable Calculus, with an Introduction to Linear Algebra](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471000051/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0471000051&linkCode=as2&tag=dzackgarza-20&linkId=5393e3e618e343c64e13b392200bb8b1)
	- A good alternative to Spivak.

## Multiviarable / Vector Calculus
- :fa-book: :fa-star: _Schey_, [Div, Grad, Curl, and All That: An Informal Text on Vector Calculus](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393925161/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0393925161&linkId=7d9d356912d7c9296c20c4cda5dd5837)
	- Most textbooks introduce these operators in a very formal way; this text expands and motivates these definitions greatly.
- :fa-tv: :fa-star: [MIT OCW Denis Auroux](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/)
	- A very geometric approach, with lots of great imagery!

<details markdown="1">
**Content**:
**Notes**: Many Calculus books cover both single and multivariable, so most of the resources from the single variable section will be applicable here as well. However, the resources in this section focus almost entirely on multivariable cases.
</details>

## Linear Algebra
- :fa-book: :fa-star: _Axler_, [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3319110799/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=3319110799&linkId=eb9410dc5d589a51d13160ce65c9dff8)
	- This subject is usually taught as a bag of computational tricks and algorithms, which obscures the absolute beauty of the subject -- this text motivates the theory nicely and shows how powerful it can be.
- :fa-book: :fa-star: _Goode and Annin_, [Differential Equations and Linear Algebra](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0130457949/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0130457949&linkId=b72706b7edf00e16d825b413e1905040)
	- Good balance of rigor vs. brevity and computation vs. theory. Very concise, gives you what you need to start calculating, but also takes time to list vector space axioms, mentions fields, a nice way of viewing the determinant formula, and (best of all) lists of many conditions that are equivalent to a matrix being singular or non-singular.
- :fa-book: _Anton_, [Elementary Linear Algebra](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118473507/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1118473507&linkId=67a5c553b282419109a3bbfdbba97406)
	- Has an entire chapter on many cool applications of Linear Algebra -- things like graph theory, computer graphics, and Google's Pagerank algorithm. Also has a lot of "historical note" blurbs that are pretty interesting.
- :fa-book: _Strang_, [Introduction to Linear Algebra](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0980232775/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0980232775&linkId=c4ee2ff3cdae059275e5a9370d59594d)
	- Strang is a giant in the world of linear algebra, so it's worth seeing how he approaches the subject.
- :fa-tv: [MIT OCW: Linear Algebra with Gilbert Strang](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)
	- Again, it's Strang, so worth checking out!

## Graduate Real Analysis
- :fa-book: _Rudin_, [Principles of Mathematical Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/007054235X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=007054235X&linkId=6999e53c498f9f1f4b2f7d6e64ac0d8a)
	- A contentious standard for real analysis. Chapter 11 has a light overview of measure theory, and the Lebesgue integral.

# General Resources

## Extracurricular Math
- :fa-book: _Garrity_, [All the Mathematics You Missed: But Need to Know for Graduate School](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521797071/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0521797071&linkCode=as2&tag=dzackgarza-20&linkId=a599d541b5c474b2a50177e0cda4b379)<div id="garrity"></div>
	- If you're thinking about grad school at all, read this! Even if you're not, it's a pretty good collection of mathematics that it's good to at least be familiar with. You can also use this to get an idea of some of the major theorems and results in a variety of subfields.
- :fa-tv: :fa-star: [Introduction to Higher Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZzHxk_TPOStgPtqRZ6KzmkUQBQ8TSWVX)
	- A great survey that highlights many different areas of advanced mathematics.
- :fa-book: _Abbott_, [Flatland](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/048627263X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=048627263X&linkId=1f5b4e9ec20ad3c1ebd5cd2af429be68)
	- As the professor who recommended this to me said, reading this book is an absolutely essential step in the professional development of every mathematician. It's a short fiction that explores a world of 1-dimensional beings that live in a 2-dimensional universe, which provides a powerful analogy for thinking about higher dimensional objects.

## Computer Science
- :fa-book: _CLRS_, [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033844/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262033844&linkCode=as2&tag=dzackgarza-20&linkId=f99bf4ce12d3ed422a41b841a3055d75)
	- :fa-external-link: [MIT OCW: Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/index.htm) is a good supplement.
- :fa-book: _McDowell_, [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782850/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0984782850&linkCode=as2&tag=dzackgarza-20&linkId=10277ceaad2b2e90ef6a1b321b555ffd)
	- Covers a number of quintessential CS interview questions, worth reading if you are preparing for internships.
- :fa-book: _Sipser_, [Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8131525295/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=8131525295&linkId=8b4d166a094b0d45b504ea7f4da63727)
	- The standard resource for an introduction to theoretical computer science. Covers things like computability, automata, and Turing machines.
- :fa-book: _Graham and Knuth_, [Concrete Mathematics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201558025/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0201558025&linkId=d0e1989fdcb7ee7be5595099a9267a00)
	- An encylopedaic reference for a huge swath of discrete Mathematics.

## The Math Subject GRE

If you are thinking about applying to graduate school in Mathematics (pure or applied), I would recommend that you start looking at the material for this exam within your first few years, and take it as soon as your Junior year.

Note that the Math Subject GRE is vastly different than the Math portion of the General GRE. The latter covers primarily high-school level mathematics and requires no courses beyond Calculus (although the questions can still be tricky). The former is over 50% Calculus, and often includes a wide variety of upper-division topics as well. Many sources confuse these two exams!

**Topics**
- Single Variable Calculus
- Multivariable Calculus
- Ordinary Differential Equations
- Linear Algebra
- Complex Analysis
- Abstract Algebra
	- Primarily groups and rings, virtually no module or Galois theory.
- Probability/Statistics
- Real Analysis
	- Convergence of sums/sequences, topological properties of $\RR$.
- Combinatorics
	- Graph theory, counting problems
- Point-Set Topology
- Numerical Analysis
- Set Theory and Logic

**Resources**
- :fa-external-link: You can find five sample exams [here.](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~iacoley/greprep.html)
- :fa-book: Princeton Review, [Cracking the Math Subject GRE](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375429727/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0375429727&linkId=a8d125e03d8fa03bd5e41231a88252d1)

**Advice**
- Most problems don't require extensive computations; there is usually a trick that solves it very quickly.
- Time is the most difficult factor, be sure to take timed practice tests. You have right around two minutes per problem.
- Sign up early, as these exams are often only held a few times per year.

- Reviews of some of the big Math-related Youtubers:
	- VSauce - 2/10
		- Often hints at neat concepts, but usually focused on "pop-math". The cotton candy of the Math video world.
	- Mathologer - 9/10
		- Rigorous without drowning in technical details, and good topic selection!
	- PBS Infinite Series - 9/10
		- Topics are much closer to "serious" math, and are often accompanied with proofs.
	- Numberphile - 7/10
		- Often eschews rigorous explanations, which leads to a very misinformed public! Many good interviews, though.
	- 3blue1brow - 8/10
		- Amazing visualization, topics are interesting but are less serious. Good for general conceptual understanding.
- Some interesting Math-related movies:
	- Good Will Hunting
	- A Beautiful Mind (John Nash)
	- The Man Who Knew Infinity (Srinivasa Ramanujan)
	- The Imitation Game (Alan Turing)
	- Proof
	- The Theory of Everything

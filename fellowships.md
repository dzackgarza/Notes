National Fellowships

A few students are able to win national fellowships. The national fellowships are awarded by various government and private foundations, and some pay rather large stipends plus tuition for the first three to five years of graduate school. Currently, we are aware of support being offered by the following organizations:

The National Science Foundation, NSF, is the largest funding agency for graduate work in mathematics, offering both regular Graduate Fellowships and some special ones for minorities. The deadline for submitting the first part of the application is usually in November. NSF will even pay for you to take your GRE's in December!
The NSF web page is http://www.nsf.gov or go directly to fastlane, the electronic fellowship application submission web page, http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov.

The Fannie and John Hertz Foundation, a private foundation that purports to support only students in "applied physical sciences", but, in reality, often funds study for 5 or more years in many areas of pure mathematics. It also has one of the most lucrative stipends. Their web site is at http://www.hertzfndn.org.
The Department of Defense. It funds the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowships (NDSEG). This is a 3-year fellowship, and it is not similar to ROTC -- you don't have to promise to serve in the military or have any other special obligations to the government if you win a fellowship. To get the application and information, check their web site at http://ndseg.asee.org. The application deadline is usually the first week of January.
Canadian students should look to The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), which provides scholarships for graduate study. For information check their web site at http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca. (NOTE: the deadlines for these lie early in the fall semester!)
Flyers put out by some of these fellowships are posted on the undergraduate bulletin boards-one is opposite room 320 and another is opposite room 503.

The Office of Career Services (OCS) Web site offers useful information for applying to graduate school and for finding sources of funding. Please review the Fellowships section on the OCS Web site at http://www.ocs.fas.harvard.edu/students/fellowships.htm. Also, OCS has a library with information on fellowships, and its staff can help you enormously in your pursuit.

The Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) offers fellowship information online at http://gsas.harvard.edu. The online publication "Financing Graduate Studies" is available to download, and the interactive database "Graduate Guide to Grants" will allow you to search for specific grants and provides contact information, application guidelines and restrictions, and deadlines.

Finally, check the Web sites of the universities where you plan to apply. Like GSAS, many graduate schools offer graduate funding options specific to their institutions.

Generally, undergraduates are urged to try their luck in all nationwide fellowships. Harvard students have been very successful in winning these awards. Some fellowships have early deadlines (as early as October) and some pay more attention to the GRE scores and grades than university admissions offices.

There are many fellowships and scholarships for study abroad. Information about them can be obtained on the Office of Career Services (OCS) website, under "Global Opportunities", or from your House Fellowships Tutor. Particularly useful are the Guide to Grants and the Guide to Study Abroad, published annually by OCS. Some of the math/science oriented fellowships are the:

Churchill Scholarship (for study at Cambridge University),
Herschel Smith Harvard Scholarship (also Cambridge),
Weizmann Institute of Science Scholarship (the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel).

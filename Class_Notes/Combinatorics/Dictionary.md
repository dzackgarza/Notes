  - $s(n, k) = \#\theset{\text{Permutations in $S^n$ having exactly $k$ cycles}}$
  - No easy closed formula.
  - Satisfies $$s(n, k) = s(n-1, k-1) + (n-1)s(n-1, k)$$
- Stirling Number of the Second Kind
  - $S(n, k) = \#\theset{\text{Set partitions of $[n]$ into $k$ parts}}$ 
    - No easy closed formula.
    - Such a partition is a collection of subsets $S_1, \cdots , S_k$ such that $S_i \intersect S_j = \emptyset$ and $\coprod_i S_i = [n]$
- Symmetric Group

**Theorem**

a. ?
b. (Cayley Hamilton) If $p$ is the minimal polynomial of a linear transformation $\phi$, then $p(\phi) = 0$
c. For any $f(x) \in k[x]$ that is irreducible, $f(x) \divides p_\phi(x) \iff f(x) \divides q_\phi(x)$.


Proof:

Proof of (a):

Proof of (b):

If $q_\phi(x) \divides p_\phi(x)$ and $q_\phi(\phi) = 0$, then $p_\phi(\phi) = 0$ as well.

Proof of (c):
We have $f(x) \divides q_\phi(x) \implies f(x) \divides p_\phi(x)$ and $f(x) \divides p_\phi(x) \implies f(x) \divides q_i(x)$ for some $i$, and so $f(x) \divides q_\phi(x)$.

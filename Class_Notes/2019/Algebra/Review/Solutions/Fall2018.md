### a

We know that every $p\dash$subgroup is contained in some Sylow $p\dash$subgroup, so $P \subseteq S_p^i$ for some $S_p^i \in \mathrm{Syl}_p(G)$.

Since $P$ is normal in $G$, we have $gPg\inv = P$ for all $g\in G$.

If $S_p^j$ is any other Sylow $p\dash$subgroup, we have $gS_p^i g\inv = S_p^j$ for some $g\in G$.

But then $P = gPg\inv \subseteq gS_p^i g\inv = S_p^j$.

### b

Write $\abs{G} = p^n m$.

If $p\divides \abs{M}$, then by maximality $\abs M = p^n$ so $M$ is a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup and thus $P \subseteq M$ by (a).

Otherwise, $p$ does not divide $\abs{M}$.
But $\abs{G} = [G: M] \abs{M} \implies p^n m = \ell k$ where $p$ does not divide $k$.

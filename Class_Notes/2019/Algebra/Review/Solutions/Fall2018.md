### a

We know that every $p\dash$subgroup is contained in some Sylow $p\dash$subgroup, so $P \subseteq S_p^i$ for some $S_p^i \in \mathrm{Syl}_p(G)$.

Since $P$ is normal in $G$, we have $gPg\inv = P$ for all $g\in G$.

If $S_p^j$ is any other Sylow $p\dash$subgroup, we have $gS_p^i g\inv = S_p^j$ for some $g\in G$.

But then $P = gPg\inv \subseteq gS_p^i g\inv = S_p^j$.

### a

We know that every $p\dash$subgroup is contained in some Sylow $p\dash$subgroup, so $P \subseteq S_p^i$ for some $S_p^i \in \mathrm{Syl}_p(G)$.

Since $P$ is normal in $G$, we have $gPg\inv = P$ for all $g\in G$.

If $S_p^j$ is any other Sylow $p\dash$subgroup, we have $gS_p^i g\inv = S_p^j$ for some $g\in G$.

But then $P = gPg\inv \subseteq gS_p^i g\inv = S_p^j$.

Suppose $a,b \in X$ where $a \in G\cdot b$, so they belong to the same orbit.
Then $a = h\actson b$ for some $h\in G$.

Then
\begin{align*}
g\in G_a 
\iff g\actson a &= a \\
\iff g \actson (h\actson b) &= h\actson b \\
\iff gh \actson b &= h\actson b \\
\iff h\inv gh \actson b &= b \\
\iff h\inv g h &\in G_b
,\end{align*}

so $g\in G_a \iff hgh\inv \in G_b$ and so the stabilizers of any two elements in the same orbit are conjugate.

### b

Suppose $\abs{H} = k$ and thus $\abs{G} = k\ell$ for some $\ell$ by Lagrange.

There are at most $\ell$ distinct conjugates, each containing $e$, yielding
$$
\ell(k-1) + 1
$$
elements.

### a

We know that every $p\dash$subgroup is contained in some Sylow $p\dash$subgroup, so $P \subseteq S_p^i$ for some $S_p^i \in \mathrm{Syl}_p(G)$.

Since $P$ is normal in $G$, we have $gPg\inv = P$ for all $g\in G$.

If $S_p^j$ is any other Sylow $p\dash$subgroup, we have $gS_p^i g\inv = S_p^j$ for some $g\in G$.

But then $P = gPg\inv \subseteq gS_p^i g\inv = S_p^j$.

Suppose $a,b \in X$ where $a \in G\cdot b$, so they belong to the same orbit.
Then $a = h\actson b$ for some $h\in G$.

Then
\begin{align*}
g\in G_a 
\iff g\actson a &= a \\
\iff g \actson (h\actson b) &= h\actson b \\
\iff gh \actson b &= h\actson b \\
\iff h\inv gh \actson b &= b \\
\iff h\inv g h &\in G_b
,\end{align*}

so $g\in G_a \iff hgh\inv \in G_b$ and so the stabilizers of any two elements in the same orbit are conjugate.

### b

Suppose $\abs{H} = n$ and thus $\abs{G} = nm$ for some $m = [G: H] \geq 2$ by Lagrange since $H$ is proper.

Let $G$ act on its subgroups by conjugation, 

- The orbit $G\cdot H$ is the set of all conjugate subgroups, and

- The stabilizer of $H$ is $G_H = N_G(H)$.

By orbit-stabilizer,
\begin{align*}
G\cdot H = [G: G_H] = [G: N_G(H)]
.\end{align*}

Let $\abs H = n$, and note that all conjugate subgroups have the same order.

Then
\begin{align*}
H \leq N_G(H) 
&\implies [G: N_G(H)] \leq [G: H] = m
.\end{align*}

and each conjugate contains the identity element, so

\begin{align*}
\union_{g\in G} gHg\inv &
\leq 1 + \sum_{H' \in G\cdot H} \left( \abs{H'} - 1 \right) \\
&= 1 + \sum_{H' \in G\cdot H} n - 1 \\
&= 1 + (n-1) \abs{G\cdot H} \\
&= 1 + (n-1) [G: N_G(H)] \\
&\leq 1 + (n-1) [G: H] \\
&= 1 + (n-1) m\\
&= 1 + nm - m \\
&= 1  + \abs{G} - m \\
&= \abs{G} - (m-1) \\
&\leq \abs{G} - 1 \quad \text{since } m \geq 2\\
&< \abs G
.\end{align*}

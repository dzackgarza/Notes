Definition: A *group* is an ordered pair $(G, \wait: G\cross G \to G)$ where $G$ is a set and $\wait$ is a binary operation, which satisfies the following axioms:

1. Associativity: $(g_1 g_2)g_3 = g_1(g_2 g_3)$
2. Identity: $\exists e\in G \suchthat  ge = eg = g$
3. Inverses: $g\in G \implies \exists h\in G \suchthat gh = gh = e$.

Some examples of groups:

- $(\ZZ, +)$
- $(\QQ, +)$
- $(\QQ\units, \times)$
- $(\RR\units, \times)$
- ($\GL(n, \RR), \times) = \theset{A \in \mathrm{Mat}_n \suchthat \det(A) \neq 0}$
- $(S_n, \circ)$

Definition: A subset $S \subseteq G$ is a *subgroup* of $G$ iff

1. $s_1, s_2 \in S \implies s_1 s_2 \in S$
2. $e\in S$
3. $s\in S \implies s\inv \in S$

We denote such a subgroup $S \leq G$.

Examples:

- $(\ZZ, +) \leq (\QQ, +)$
- $\SL(n, \RR) \leq \GL(n, \RR)$, where $\SL(n, \RR) = \theset{A\in \GL(n, \RR) \suchthat \det(A) = 1}$

## Cyclic Groups

Definition: A group $G$ is cyclic iff $G$ is generated by a single element.

Exercise: Show $\generators{g} = \theset{g^n \suchthat n\in\ZZ} \cong \intersect \theset{H \leq G \suchthat g \in H}$.

Theorem: Let $G$ be a cyclic group, so $G \generators{g}$.

1. If $\abs{G} = \infty$, then $G \cong \ZZ$.
2. If $\abs{G} = n < \infty$, then $G \cong \ZZ_n$


Definition: Let $H \leq G$, and define a *right coset of $G$* by $aH = \theset{ah \suchthat H \in H}$. A similar definition can be made for *left cosets*.

Then $aH = bH \iff b\inv a \in G$ and $Ha = Hb \iff ab\inv \in H$.

Some facts:

- Cosets partition $H$, i.e. $b\not\in H \implies aH \intersect bH = \theset{e}$.
- $\abs{H} = \abs{aH} = \abs{Ha}$ for all $a\in G$.

Theorem (Lagrange): If $G$ is a finite group and $H \leq G$, then $\abs{H} \divides \abs{G}$.

Definition: $N \leq G$ is *normal* iff $gN = Ng$ for all $g\in G$, or equivalently $gNg\inv \subseteq N$. I denote this $N \normal G$.

When $N \normal G$, the set of left/right cosets of $N$ themselves have a group structure. So we define $G/N = \theset{gN \suchthat g\in G}$ where $(g_1 N)(g_2 N) = (g_1 g_2) N$.

Given $H, K \leq G$, define $HK = \theset{hk \suchthat h\in H, k\in K}$. We have a general formula,
$$
\abs{HK} = \frac{\abs H \abs K}{\abs{H \intersect K}}.
$$

## Homomorphisms

Let $G,G'$ be groups, then $\varphi: G \to G'$ is a *homomorphism* if $\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a) \varphi(b)$.

Examples:

- $\exp: (\RR, +) \to (\RR^{> 0}, \wait)$ where $\exp(a+b) = e^{a+b} = e^a e^b = \exp(a) \exp(b)$.
- $\det: (\GL(n, \RR), \times) \to (\RR\units, \times)$ where $\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)$.
- Let $N \normal G$ and $\varphi G \to G/N$ given by $\varphi(g) = gN$.
- Let $\varphi: \ZZ \to \ZZ_n$ where $\phi(g) = [g] = g \mod n$ where $\ZZ_n \cong \ZZ/n\ZZ$

Definitions: Let $\varphi: G \to G'$. Then $\varphi$ is a *monomorphism* iff it is injective, an *epimorphism* iff it is surjective, and an *isomorphism* iff it is bijective.

## Direct Products
Let $G_1, G_2$ be groups, then define $G_1 \cross G_2 = \theset{(g_1, g_2) \suchthat g_1 \in G, g_2 \in G_2}$ where $(g_1, g_2)(h_1, h_2) = (g_1 h_1, g_2 ,h_2)$.

We have the formula $\abs{G_1 \cross G_2} = \abs{G_1} \abs{G_2}$.

## Finitely Generated Abelian Groups

We say a group is *abelian* if $G$ is commutative, i.e. $g_1, g_2 \in G \implies g_1 g_2 = g_2 g_1$.

A group is *finitely generated* if there exist $\theset{g_1, g_2, \cdots g_n} \subseteq G$ such that $G = \generators{g_1, g_2, \cdots g_n}$. This generalizes the notion of a cyclic group, where we can simply intersect all of the subgroups that contain the $g_i$ to define it.

We know what cyclic groups look like -- they are all isomorphic to $\ZZ$ or $\ZZ_n$. So now we'd like a structure theorem for abelian f.g. groups.

Theorem: Let $G$ be a f.g. abelian group. Then $G \cong \ZZ^r \times \displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^s \ZZ_{p_i^{\alpha _i}}$ for some finite $r,s \in \NN$ and $p_i$ are (not necessarily distinct) primes.

Example: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group of order 4. Then $G \cong \ZZ_4$ or $\ZZ_2^2$, which are not isomorphic because every element in $\ZZ_2^2$ has order 2 where $\ZZ_4$ contains an element of order 4.

## Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem

Let $\varphi: G \to G'$ and define $\ker \varphi = \theset{g\in G \suchthat \varphi(g) = e'}$.

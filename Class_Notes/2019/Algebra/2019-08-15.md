# Major Theorems

\wrapenv{\Begin{theorem}[Cauchy]}
For any prime $p$ dividing the order of $G$, there is an element $x$ of order $p$ (and thus a subgroup $H = \generators{x}$ of order $p$ as well).
\wrapenv{\End{theorem}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{theorem}[Lagrange]}
If $H \leq G$ is a subgroup, then $\abs{H} \divides \abs{G}$. Moreover,
$$
\abs G = [G: H]~~\abs H.
$$
\wrapenv{\End{theorem}}


\wrapenv{\Begin{theorem}[Sylow 1]}
If $\abs{G} = n = \prod p_{i}^{a_{i}}$ as a prime factorization, then $G$ has subgroups of order $p_{i}^{a_{i}}$ for every $i$ and for every $1 \leq r \leq a_{i}$. In particular, $\mathrm{Syl}(p, G) \neq \emptyset$.

Moreover, every subgroup $H$ of order $p^k$ is normal in a subgroup of order $p^{k+1}$ for $1 \leq k \leq \alpha_i$, and thus $H \leq P$ for some $P \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G)$.
\wrapenv{\End{theorem}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{theorem}[Sylow 2]}
If $P_1, P_2 \in \mathrm{Syl}(p, G)$, then there exists a $g\in G$ such that $gP_1g = P_2$.
\wrapenv{\End{theorem}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{theorem}[Sylow 3]}
Let $\abs G = p^n m$ and $r_p = \abs{\mathrm{Syl}(p, G)}$. Then

- $r_p = 1 \mod p$,
- $r_p \divides m$,
- $r_p = [G: N_G(P)]$.

\wrapenv{\End{theorem}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{theorem}[Classification of finitely generated abelian groups]}
If $G$ is a finitely generated abelian group, then $G \cong F \oplus T$, where $F$ is free abelian and $T$ is a torsion group. If $\abs T = n$, then $T \cong \bigoplus \ZZ_{p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}}$ where $n = \prod p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$ is some factorization of $n$ with the $p_{i}$ **not necessarily distinct**.
\wrapenv{\End{theorem}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{theorem}}
Conjugacy classes partition $G$
\[
\begin{align*}
|G|=|Z(G)| + \sum_{\text{One representative in each orbit}} |C_{G}\left(g_{i}\right) |
= \sum_{asdsa} [G: C(g_{i}) ]
.\end{align*}
\]
\wrapenv{\End{theorem}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{theorem}[Orbit Stabilizer]}
If $G\actson X$, then for any $x\in X$
$$
[G: \mathrm{Stab}(x)] = \abs{\mathcal O_x},\quad \text{i.e.}\quad
\abs{G} = \abs{\mathcal O_x} \abs{\mathrm{Stab}(x)}
$$

where $\mathcal O_x = \theset{g\actson x \suchthat g\in G}\subseteq X$ and $\mathrm{Stab}(x) = \theset{x\in X \suchthat \forall g\in G,~ g\actson x = x} \leq G$.
\wrapenv{\End{theorem}}
Some nice lemmas:

- Every subgroup of a cyclic group is itself cyclic.
- $aH = bH \iff b\inv a \in H$.
- $A \leq G$ and $B \leq G \implies (A\intersect B) \leq G$.
  - Corollary: $\#A = p, \#B = q \implies A\intersect B = \theset{e}$.
  - Corollary: $\#A = p, \#B = p \implies A=B$ or $A\intersect B = \theset{e}$.

## Preliminaries
\wrapenv{\Begin{definition}}
A **group** is an ordered pair $(G, \wait: G\cross G \to G)$ where $G$ is a set and $\wait$ is a binary operation, which satisfies the following axioms:

- Associativity: $(g_1 g_2)g_3 = g_1(g_2 g_3)$,
- Identity: $\exists e\in G \suchthat  ge = eg = g$,
- Inverses: $g\in G \implies \exists h\in G \suchthat gh = gh = e$.

\wrapenv{\End{definition}}

\wrapenv{\wrapenv{\Begin{example}}}
\hfill
- $(\ZZ, +)$
- $(\QQ, +)$
- $(\QQ\units, \times)$
- $(\RR\units, \times)$
- ($\GL(n, \RR), \times) = \theset{A \in \mathrm{Mat}_n \suchthat \det(A) \neq 0}$
- $(S_n, \circ)$

\wrapenv{\wrapenv{\End{example}}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{definition}}
A subset $S \subseteq G$ is a **subgroup** of $G$ iff

1. $s_1, s_2 \in S \implies s_1 s_2 \in S$
2. $e\in S$
3. $s\in S \implies s\inv \in S$

\wrapenv{\End{definition}}


We denote such a subgroup $S \leq G$.

Examples of subgroups:

- $(\ZZ, +) \leq (\QQ, +)$
- $\SL(n, \RR) \leq \GL(n, \RR)$, where $\SL(n, \RR) = \theset{A\in \GL(n, \RR) \suchthat \det(A) = 1}$

## Cyclic Groups

\wrapenv{\Begin{definition}}
A group $G$ is **cyclic** iff $G$ is generated by a single element.
\wrapenv{\End{definition}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{exercise}}
Show $\generators{g} = \theset{g^n \suchthat n\in\ZZ} \cong \intersect_{g\in G} \theset{H \suchthat H \leq G \text{ and } g\in H}$.
\wrapenv{\End{exercise}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{theorem}}
Let $G$ be a cyclic group, so $G = \generators{g}$.

- If $\abs{G} = \infty$, then $G \cong \ZZ$.
- If $\abs{G} = n < \infty$, then $G \cong \ZZ_n$.

\wrapenv{\End{theorem}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{definition}}
Let $H \leq G$, and define a **right coset of $G$** by $aH = \theset{ah \suchthat H \in H}$. A similar definition can be made for **left cosets**.
\wrapenv{\End{definition}}

Then $aH = bH \iff b\inv a \in H$ and $Ha = Hb \iff ab\inv \in H$.

Some facts:

- Cosets partition $H$, i.e. $b\not\in H \implies aH \intersect bH = \theset{e}$.
- $\abs{H} = \abs{aH} = \abs{Ha}$ for all $a\in G$.

\wrapenv{\Begin{theorem}[Lagrange]}
If $G$ is a finite group and $H \leq G$, then $\abs{H} \divides \abs{G}$.
\wrapenv{\End{theorem}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{definition}}
A subgroup $N \leq G$ is **normal** iff $gN = Ng$ for all $g\in G$, or equivalently $gNg\inv \subseteq N$. I denote this $N \normal G$.

\wrapenv{\End{definition}}

When $N \normal G$, the set of left/right cosets of $N$ themselves have a group structure. So we define
$$G/N = \theset{gN \suchthat g\in G} \text{ where } (g_1 N)(g_2 N) = (g_1 g_2) N.
$$

Given $H, K \leq G$, define $HK = \theset{hk \suchthat h\in H, k\in K}$. We have a general formula,
$$
\abs{HK} = \frac{\abs H \abs K}{\abs{H \intersect K}}.
$$

## Homomorphisms

\wrapenv{\Begin{definition}}
Let $G,G'$ be groups, then $\varphi: G \to G'$ is a **homomorphism** if $\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a) \varphi(b)$.
\wrapenv{\End{definition}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{example}}

- $\exp: (\RR, +) \to (\RR^{> 0}, \wait)$ where $\exp(a+b) = e^{a+b} = e^a e^b = \exp(a) \exp(b)$.
- $\det: (\GL(n, \RR), \times) \to (\RR\units, \times)$ where $\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)$.
- Let $N \normal G$ and $\varphi G \to G/N$ given by $\varphi(g) = gN$.
- Let $\varphi: \ZZ \to \ZZ_n$ where $\phi(g) = [g] = g \mod n$ where $\ZZ_n \cong \ZZ/n\ZZ$

\wrapenv{\End{example}}


\wrapenv{\Begin{definition}}
Let $\varphi: G \to G'$. Then $\varphi$ is a **monomorphism** iff it is injective, an **epimorphism** iff it is surjective, and an **isomorphism** iff it is bijective.
\wrapenv{\End{definition}}

## Direct Products
Let $G_1, G_2$ be groups, then define
$$
G_1 \cross G_2 = \theset{(g_1, g_2) \suchthat g_1 \in G, g_2 \in G_2} \text{ where } (g_1, g_2)(h_1, h_2) = (g_1 h_1, g_2 ,h_2).
$$

We have the formula $\abs{G_1 \cross G_2} = \abs{G_1} \abs{G_2}$.

## Finitely Generated Abelian Groups

\wrapenv{\Begin{definition}}
We say a group is **abelian** if $G$ is commutative, i.e. $g_1, g_2 \in G \implies g_1 g_2 = g_2 g_1$.
\wrapenv{\End{definition}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{definition}}
A group is **finitely generated** if there exist $\theset{g_1, g_2, \cdots g_n} \subseteq G$ such that $G = \generators{g_1, g_2, \cdots g_n}$.
\wrapenv{\End{definition}}

This generalizes the notion of a cyclic group, where we can simply intersect all of the subgroups that contain the $g_i$ to define it.

We know what cyclic groups look like -- they are all isomorphic to $\ZZ$ or $\ZZ_n$. So now we'd like a structure theorem for abelian finitely generated groups.

\wrapenv{\Begin{theorem}}
Let $G$ be a finitely generated abelian group. Then
$$G \cong \ZZ^r \times \displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^s \ZZ_{p_i^{\alpha _i}}$$
for some finite $r,s \in \NN$ and $p_i$ are (not necessarily distinct) primes.
\wrapenv{\End{theorem}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{example}}
Let $G$ be a finite abelian group of order 4. Then $G \cong \ZZ_4$ or $\ZZ_2^2$, which are not isomorphic because every element in $\ZZ_2^2$ has order 2 where $\ZZ_4$ contains an element of order 4.
\wrapenv{\End{example}}

## Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem

Let $\varphi: G \to G'$ be a group homomorphism and define
$\ker \varphi = \theset{g\in G \suchthat \varphi(g) = e'}$.

### The First Homomorphism Theorem
\wrapenv{\Begin{theorem}}
There exists a map $\varphi': G/\ker \varphi \to G'$ such that the following diagram commutes:
\[
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
G \arrow[dd, "\eta"'] \arrow[rr, "\varphi", dotted] &  & G' \\
&  &    \\
G/\ker \varphi \arrow[rruu, "\varphi'"]             &  &
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\]

That is, $\varphi = \varphi' \circ \eta$, and $\varphi'$ is an isomorphism onto its image, so $G/\ker \varphi = \im \varphi$. This map is given by $\varphi'(g(\ker \varphi)) = \varphi(g)$.
\wrapenv{\End{theorem}}


\wrapenv{\Begin{exercise}}
Check that $\varphi$ is well-defined.
\wrapenv{\End{exercise}}

### The Second Theorem
\wrapenv{\Begin{theorem}}
Let $K, N \leq G$ where $N \normal G$. Then
$$
\frac K {N \intersect K} \cong \frac {NK} N
$$
\wrapenv{\End{theorem}}

\wrapenv{\Begin{proof}}
Define a map $K \mapsvia{\varphi} NK/N$ by $\varphi(k) = kN$. You can show that $\varphi$ is onto, then look at $\ker \varphi$; note that $kN = \varphi(k) = N \iff k \in N$, and so $\ker \varphi = N \intersect K$.
\wrapenv{\End{proof}}

# Lecture 2

Last time: the fundamental homomorphism theorems.

Theorem 1:
Let $\varphi: G \to G'$ be a homomorphism. Then there is a canonical homomorphism $\eta: G \to G/\ker \varphi$ such that the usual diagram commutes. Moreover, this map induces an isomorphism $G /\ker \varphi \cong \im \varphi$.

Theorem 2: Let $K, N \leq G$ and suppose $N \normal G$. Then there is an isomorphism
$$
\frac K {K \intersect N} \cong \frac {NK} {N}
$$
(Show that $K \intersect N \normal G$, and $NK$ is a subgroup exactly because $N$ is normal).

Theorem 3: Let $H, K \normal G$ such that $H \leq K$.

1. $H/K$ is normal in $G/K$.
2. The quotient $(G/K) / (H/K) \cong G/H$.

Proof: We'll use the first theorem. First make a map
$$
G/K \to G/H \\
\phi(gk) = gH
$$

Exercise:
Show that this map is onto, and that $\ker \phi \cong H/K$.


## Permutation Groups
Let $A$ be a set, then a *permutation* on $A$ is a bijective map $A \selfmap$. This can be made into a group with a binary operation given by composition of functions. Denote $S_{A}$ the set of permutations on $A$.

Theorem: $S_{A}$ is in fact a group. Check associativity, inverses, identity, etc.

In the special case that $A = \theset{1, 2, \cdots n}$, then $S_{n} \coloneqq S_{A}$.

Recall two line notation
$$
\left(\begin{matrix}
1 & 2 & \cdots & n\\
\sigma(1) & \sigma(2) & \cdots & \sigma(n)
\end{matrix}\right)
$$

Moreover, $\abs{S_{n}} = n!$ by a combinatorial counting argument.

Example: $S_{3}$ is the symmetries of a triangle (see notes).

Example: The symmetries of a square are *not* given by $S_{4}$, it is instead $D_{4}$ (see notes).

## Orbits
Permutations $S_{A}$ "acts" on $A$, and if $\sigma \in S_{A}$, then $\generators{\sigma}$ also acts on $A$.

Define $a \sim b$ iff there is some $n$ such that $\sigma^{n}(a) = b$. This is an equivalence relation, and thus induces a partition of $A$. See notes for diagram. The equivalence classes under this relation are called the *orbits* under $\sigma$.

Example:
$$
\left(\begin{matrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
8 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 7 & 4 & 5 & 1
\end{matrix}\right) = (1 8)(2)(3 6 4)(5 7).
$$

Definition:
A permutation $\sigma \in S_{n}$ is a *cycle* iff it contains at most one orbit with more than one element. The *length* of a cycle is the number of elements in the largest orbit.

Recall cycle notation: $\sigma = (\sigma(1) \sigma(2) \cdots \sigma(n))$. Note that this is read right-to-left by convention!

Theorem:
Every permutation $\sigma \in S_{n}$ can be written as a product of disjoint cycles.

Definition:
A *transposition* is a cycle of length 2. Moreover, we have
$$
(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}) = (a_{1} a_{n}) (a_{1} a_{n-1}) \cdots (a_{1} a_{2}),
$$

and so every permutation is a product of transpositions. This is not a unique decomposition, however, as e.g. $\id = (1 2)^{2} = (3 4)^{2}$.

Theorem:
Any $\sigma \in S_{n}$ can be written as **either** an even number of transpositions or an odd number of transpositions.

Define $A_{n} = \theset{\sigma \in S_{n} \suchthat \sigma\text{ is even}}$. We claim that $A_{n} \normal S_{n}$.

1. Closure: If $\tau_{1}, \tau_{2}$ are both even, then $\tau_{1}\tau_{2}$ also has an even number of transpositions.
2. The identity has an even number of transpositions, since zero is even.
3. Inverses: If $\sigma = \prod_{i=1}^{s} \tau_{i}$ where $s$ is even, then $\sigma\inv = \prod_{i=1}^{s} \tau_{s-i}$. But each $\tau$ is order 2, so $\tau\inv = \tau$, so there are still an even number of transpositions.

So $A_{n}$ is a subgroup. It is normal because it is index 2, or the kernel of a homomorphism, or by a direct computation.

## Groups Acting on Sets

Think of this as a generalization of a $G\dash$module.

Definition:
A group $G$ is said to *act* on a set $X$ if there exists a map $G\cross X \to X$ such that

1. $e\actson x = x$
2. $(g_{1} g_{2})\actson x = g_{1} \actson (g_{2} \actson x)$.

Examples:

1. $G = S_{A} \actson A$
2. $H \leq G$, then $G \actson X = G/H$ where $g \actson xH = (gx)H$.
3. $G \actson G$ by conjugation, i.e. $g\actson x = gxg\inv$.

Definition:
Let $x\in X$, then define the *stabilizer subgroup*
$$
G_{x} = \theset{g\in G \suchthat g\actson x = x} \leq G
$$

We can also look at the dual thing,
$$
X_{g} = \theset{x\in X \suchthat g\actson x = x}.
$$

We then define the *orbit* of an element $x$ as
$$
Gx = \theset{g\actson x \suchthat g\in G}
$$
and we have a similar result where $x\sim y \iff x\in Gy$, and the orbits partition $X$.


Theorem:
Let $G$ act on $X$. We want to know the number of elements in an orbit, and it turns out that
\[
\begin{align}
\abs{Gx} = [G: G_{x}]
\end{align}
\]
Proof:
Construct a map $Gx \mapsvia{\psi} G/Gx$ where $\psi(g\actson x) = g Gx$.
Exercise: Show that this is well-defined, so if 2 elements are equal then they go to the same coset.
Exercise: Show that this is surjective.

Injectivity: $\psi(g_{1} x) = \psi(g_{2} x)$, so $g_{1} Gx = g_{2} Gx$ and $(g_{2}\inv g_{1}) Gx = Gx$ so $g_{2}\inv g_{1} \in Gx \iff g_{2}\inv g_{1} \actson x = x \iff g_{1}x = g_{2} x$.


Next time: Burnside's theorem, proving the Sylow theorems.


# Lecture 3 (Aug 22)

Last time: let $G$ be a group and $X$ be a set; we say $G$ *acts* on $X$ (or that $X$ is a $G\dash$ set) when there is a map $G\cross X \to X$ such that $ex = x$ and $(gh) \actson x = g \actson (h \actson x)$. We then define the *stabilizer of $x$* as
$$
G_x = \theset{g\in G \suchthat g\actson x = x} \leq G,
$$

and the *orbit*
$$
G.x = \mathcal O_x = \theset{g\actson x \suchthat x\in X} \subseteq X.
$$

When $G$ is finite, we have
$$
\# G.x  = \frac{\# G}{\# G_x}.
$$

We can also consider the fixed points of $X$,
$$
X_g = \theset{x\in X \suchthat g\actson x = x \forall g\in G} \subseteq X
$$

## Burnside's Theorem
Theorem (Burnside):
Let $X$ be a $G\dash$set and $v$ be the number of orbits. Then
$$
v \# G = \sum_{g\in G} \# X_g.
$$
Proof:

Define $N = \theset{(g,x) \suchthat g\actson x = x} \subseteq G \cross X$, we then have
\[
\begin{align*}
\abs N &= \sum_{g\in G} \abs{X_g} \\
&= \sum_{x\in X} \abs{G_x} \\
&= \sum_{x\in X} \frac{\abs G}{\abs {G.x}} \\
&= \abs{G} \left( \sum_{x\in X} \frac{1}{\abs{Gx}} \right) \\
&= \abs{G} v
.\end{align*}
\]

Since the orbits partition $X$, say into $X = \union_{i=1}^v \sigma_i$, let $\sigma = \theset{\sigma_i \suchthat 1 \leq i \leq v}$ and abuse notation slightly by replacing each orbit in $\sigma$ with a representative element $x_i\in \sigma_i \subset X$. We then have
$$
\sum_{x \in \sigma} \frac{1}{\abs{G.x}} = \frac{1}{\abs{Gx}} \abs{\sigma}  = 1.
$$

Application:
Consider seating 10 people around a circular table. How many distinct seating arrangements are there?

Let $X$ be the set of configurations, $G = S_{10}$, and let $G\actson X$ by permuting configurations. Then $v$, the number of orbits under this action, yields the number of distinct seating arrangements. By Burnside, we have
$$
v = \frac{1}{\abs{G}} \sum_{g\in G} \abs{Xg} = \frac{1}{10} (10!) = 9!,
$$

since $Xg = \theset{x\in X \suchthat gx = x} = \emptyset$ unless $g = e$, and $X_e = X$.

## Sylow Theory

Recall Lagrange's theorem: If $H \leq G$ and $G$ is finite, then $\# H \mid \# G$.

Consider the converse: if $n \mid \# G$, does there exist a subgroup of size $n$? The answer is no in general, and a counterexample is $A_4$ which has $4!/2 = 12$ elements but no subgroup of order 6.

### Class Functions

Let $X$ be a $G\dash$set, and choose orbit representatives $x_1 \cdots x_v$. Then
$$
\abs{X} = \sum_{i=1}^v \abs{G x_i}.
$$

We can then separately count all orbits with exactly one element, which is exactly
$X_G = \theset{x\in G \suchthat g\actson x = x ~ \forall g\in G}$.

We then have
$$
\abs X = \abs{X_G} + \sum_{i=j}^v
$$
for some $j$ where $\abs{G x_i} > 1$ for all $i \geq j$.

Theorem:
Let $G$ be a group of order $p^n$ for $p$ a prime, then
$$
\abs X = \abs{X_G} \mod p
$$

Proof: We know that $\abs{G x_i} = [G : G_{x_i}]$ for $j \leq i \leq v$, and $\abs{Gx_i} > 1$ implies that $G x_i \neq G$ and thus $p \mid [G: G x_i]$. The result follows.


Application:
If $\abs G = p^n$, then the center $Z(G)$ is nontrivial. Let $X=G$ act on itself by conjugation, so $g\actson x = gxg\inv$. Then
$$
X_G = \theset{x\in G \suchthat gxg\inv = x} = \theset{x\in G \suchthat gx = xg} = Z(G)
$$

But then, by the previous theorem, we have $\abs{Z(G)} \equiv \abs{X}\equiv \abs{G} \mod p$, but since $Z(G) \leq G$ we have $\abs{Z(G)} \cong 0 \mod p$, and so in particular, $Z(G) \neq \theset{e}$.

Definition:
A group $G$ is a $p\dash$group iff every element in $G$ has order $p^k$ for some $k$. A subgroup is a $p\dash$group exactly when it is a $p\dash$group in its own right.

### Cauchy's Theorem
Theorem (Cauchy):
Let $G$ be a finite group, where $p\divides \abs{G}$ is a prime. Then $G$ is an element (and thus a subgroup) of order $p$.

Proof:
Consider $X = \theset{(g_1, g_2, \cdots , g_p) \in G^{\oplus p} \suchthat g_1g_2\cdots g_p = e}$. Given any $p-1$ elements, say $g_1 \cdots g_{p-1}$, the remaining element is completely determined by $g_p = (g_1 \cdots g_{p-1})\inv$. So $\abs X = \abs{G}^{p-1}$.

Since $p \divides \abs{G}$, we have $p \divides \abs X$. Now let $\sigma \in S_p$ the symmetric group act on $X$ by index permutation, i.e. $\sigma \actson (g_1, g_2 \cdots g_p) = (g_{\sigma(1)}, g_{\sigma(2)}, \cdots, g_{\sigma(p)})$.

Exercise: Check that this gives a well-defined group action.

Let $\sigma = (1~2~\cdots~p) \in S_p$, and note $\generators{\sigma} \leq S_p$ also acts on $X$ where $\abs{\generators{\sigma}} = p$. Therefore we have
$$
\abs{X} = \abs{X_{\generators{\sigma}}} \mod p.
$$

Since $p\divides \abs{X}$, it follows that $\abs{X_{\generators{\sigma}}} = 0 \mod p$, and thus $p \divides \abs{X_{\generators{\sigma}}}$.

If $\generators{\sigma}$ fixes $(g_1, g_2, \cdots g_p)$, then $g_1 = g_2 = \cdots g_p$.

Note that $(e, e, \cdots) \in X_{\generators{\sigma}}$, as is $(a, a, \cdots a)$ since $p \divides \abs{X_{\generators{\sigma}}}$. So there is some $a\in G$ such that $a^p = 1$. Moreover, $\generators{a} \leq G$ is a subgroup of size $p$.

### Normalizers
Let $G$ be a group and $X = S$ be the set of subgroups of $G$. Let $G$ act on $X$ by $g\actson H = gHg\inv$. What is the stabilizer? $G_x = G_H = \theset{g\in G \suchthat gHg\inv = H}$, making $G_H$ the largest subgroup such that $H \normal G_H$. So we define $N_G(H) = G_H$.

Lemma:
Let $H$ be a $p\dash$subgroup of $G$ of order $p^n$. Then $[N_G(H) : H] = [G : H] \mod p$.

Proof: Let $S = G/H$ be the set of left $H\dash$cosets in $G$. Now let $H$ act on $S$ by $H\actson x + H = (hx) + H$.

By a previous theorem, $\abs{G/H} = \abs{S} = \abs{S_H} \mod p$, where $\abs{G/H} = [G: H]$. What is $S_H$? Thus is given by $S_H = \theset{x + H \in S \suchthat xHx\inv \in H \forall h\in H}$. Therefore $x\in N_G(H)$.

Corollary: Let $H \leq G$ be a subgroup of order $p^n$. If $p \divides [G: H]$ then $N_G(H) \neq H$.
Proof: Exercise.

Theorem:
Let $G$ be a finite group, then $G$ is a $p\dash$group iff $\abs{G} = p^n$.

Proof:
Suppose $\abs{G} = p^n$ and $a \in G$. Then $\abs{\generators{a}} = p^\alpha$ for some $\alpha$.
Conversely, suppose $G$ is a $p\dash$group. Factor $\abs{G}$ into primes and suppose $\exists q$ such that $q \divides \abs{G}$ but $q \neq p$. By Cauchy, we can then get a subgroup $\generators{c}$ such that $\abs{\generators{c}} \divides q$, but then $\abs{G} \neq p^n$.

# Lecture 4: TODO

# Lecture 5 (Tuesday 8/27)

Let $G$ be a finite group and $p$ a prime. TFAE:

- $\abs{H} = p^n$ for some $n$
- Every element of $H$ has order $p^\alpha$ for some $\alpha$.

If either of these are true, we say $H$ is a *$p\dash$group*.

Let $H$ be a $p\dash$group, last time we proved that if $p \divides [G : H]$ then $N_G(H) \neq H$.

## Sylow Theorems

Let $G$ be a finite group and suppose $\abs{G} = p^n m$ where $(m, n) = 1$. Then

### Sylow 1
Motto: take a prime factorization of $\abs{G}$, then there are subgroups of order $p^i$ for *every* prime power appearing, up to the maximal power.

1. $G$ contains a subgroup of order $p^i$ for every $1 \leq i \leq n$.
2. Every subgroup $H$ of order $p^i$ where $i < n$ is a normal subgroup in a subgroup of order $p^{i+1}$.

Proof:
By induction on $i$. For $i=1$, we know this by Cauchy's theorem. If we show (2), that shows (1) as a consequence. So suppose this holds for $i < n$. Let $H \leq G$ where $\abs{H} = p^i$, we now want a subgroup of order $p^{i+1}$. Since $p\divides [G: H]$, by the previous theorem, $H < N_G(H)$ is a proper subgroup (?).

Now consider the canonical projection $N_G(H) \to N_G(H) /H$. Since $p \divides [N_G(H) : H] = \abs{N_G(H)/ H}$, by Cauchy there is a subgroup of order $p$ in this quotient. Call it $K$. Then $\pi\inv(K) \leq N_G(H)$.

Exercise: $\abs{\phi\inv(K)} = p^{i+1}$.

It now follows that $H \normal \phi\inv(K)$.
$\qed$

Definition: For $G$ a finite group and $\abs{G} = p^n m$ where $p\not\divides m$. Then a subgroup of order $p^n$ is called a Sylow $p\dash$subgroup. (By Sylow 1, these exist.)

### Sylow 2

If $P_1, P_2$ are Sylow $p\dash$subgroups of $G$, then $P_1$ and $P_2$ are conjugate.

Proof:
Let $\mathcal L$ be the left cosets of $P_1$, i.e. $\mathcal L = G/P_1$. Then let $P_2$ act on $\mathcal L$ by $p_2 \actson (g + P_1) \coloneqq (p_2g) + P_1$.

By a previous theorem about orbits and fixed points, we have
$$
\abs{\mathcal L_{P_2}} = \abs{\mathcal L} \mod p.
$$

Since $p\not\divides \abs{\mathcal L}$, we have $p\not\divides \abs{\mathcal L_{P_2}}$. So $\mathcal L_{P_2}$ is nonempty.

So there exists a coset $xP_1$ such that $xP_1 \in \mathcal L_{P_2}$, and so $yxP_1 = xP_1$ for all $y\in P_2$.

Then $x\inv y x P_1 = P_1$ for all $y\in P_2$, and so $x\inv P_2 x = P_1$. But then $P_1$ and $P_2$ are conjugate.
$\qed$

### Sylow 3

Let $G$ be a finite group, and $p\divides \abs G$. Let $r_p$ be the number of Sylow $p\dash$subgroups of $G$. Then

- $r_p \cong 1 \mod p$.
- $r_p \divides \abs G$.
- $r_p = [G : N_G(P)]$

Let $X = \mathcal S$ be the set of Sylow $p\dash$subgroups, and let $P \in X$ be a fixed Sylow $p\dash$subgroup. Let $P \actson \mathcal S$ by conjugation, so for $\overline P \in \mathcal S$ let $x \actson \overline P = x \overline P x\inv$.

By the same old theorem, we have
$$
\abs{\mathcal S} = \mathcal{S}_P \mod p
$$

What are the fixed points $\mathcal{S}_P$?
$$
\mathcal{S}_P = \theset{T \in \mathcal S \suchthat xTx\inv  = T \quad \forall x\in P}.
$$

Let $\mathcal T \in \mathcal{S}_P$, so $xTx\inv = T$ for all $x\in P$. Then $P \leq N_G(T)$, so both $P$ and $T$ are Sylow $p\dash$ subgroups in $N_G(H)$ as well as $G$.

Then there exists a $f\in N_G(T)$ such that $T = gPg\inv$. But the point is that in the normalizer, there is only **one** Sylow $p\dash$ subgroup. But then $T$ is the unique largest normal subgroup of $N_G(T)$, which forces $T = P$.

But then $\mathcal{S}_P = \theset{P}$, and using the formula, we have $r_p \cong 1 \mod p$.

Now modify this slightly by letting $G$ act on $\mathcal S$ (instead of just $P$) by conjugation.
Since all Sylows are conjugate, by Sylow (1) there is only one orbit, so $\mathcal S = GP$ for $P \in \mathcal S$. But then
$$
r_p = \abs{\mathcal S} = \abs{GP} = [G: G_p] \divides \abs{G}.
$$

Note that this gives a precise formula for $r_p$, although the theorem is just an upper bound of sorts, and $G_p = N_G(P)$.

### Applications

Of interest historically: classifying finite *simple* groups, where a group $G$ is *simple* If $N \normal G$ and $N \neq \theset{e}$, then $N=G$.

Example:
Let $G = \ZZ_p$, any subgroup would need to have order dividing $p$, so $G$ must be simple.

Example:
$G = A_n$ for $n\geq 5$ (see Galois theory)

One major application is proving that groups of a certain order are *not* simple.

Applications:

1. Let $\abs G = p^n q$ with $p > q$. Then $G$ is not simple.

> Strategy: Find a proper normal nontrivial subgroup using Sylow theory. Can either show $r_p = 1$, or produce normal subgroups by intersecting distinct Sylow p-subgroups.

Consider $r_p$, then $r_p = p^\alpha q^\beta$ for some $\alpha, \beta$. But since $r_p \cong 1 \mod p$, $p\not\divides r_p$, we must have $r_p = 1, q$. But since $q < p$ and $q\neq 1 \mod p$, this forces $r_p = 1$.

So let $P$ be a sylow $p\dash$subgroup, then $P < G$. Then $gPg\inv$ is also a sylow, but there's only 1 of them, so $P$ is normal.

2. Let $\abs{G} = 45$, then $G$ is not simple. (Exercise)

3. Let $\abs{G} = p^n$, then $G$ is not simple if $n > 1$.

By Sylow (1), there is a normal subgroup of order $p^{n-1}$ in $G$.

4. Let $\abs{G} = 48$, then $G$ is not simple.

Note $48 = 2^4 3$, so consider $r_2$, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups. Then $r_2 \cong 1 \mod 2$ and $r_2 \divides 48$. So $r_2 = 1, 3$. If $r_2 = 1$, we're done, otherwise suppose $r_2 = 3$.

Let $H \neq K$ be Sylow 2-subgroups, so $\abs H = \abs K = 2^4 = 16$. Now consider $H \intersect K$, which is a subgroup of $G$. How big is it?

Since $H\neq K, \abs{H \intersect K} < 16$. The order has to divides 16, so we in fact have $\abs{H \intersect K} \leq 8$. Suppose it is less than 4, towards a contradiction. Then
$$
\abs{HK} = \frac{\abs H \abs K}{\abs{H \intersect K}} \geq \frac{(16)(16)}{4} = 64 > \abs{G} = 48.
$$

So we can only have $\abs{H \intersect K} = 8$. Since this is an index 2 subgroup in both $H$ and $K$, it is in fact normal. But then $H, K \subseteq N_G(H \intersect K) \coloneqq X$. But then $\abs X$ must be a multiple of 16 *and* divide 48, so it's either 16 or 28. But $\abs X > 16$, because $H \subseteq X$ and $K \subseteq X$. So then $N_G(H \intersect K) = G$, and so $H \intersect K \normal G$.

## Classification of groups of a certain order

We have a classification of finite abelian groups (see table)


# Lecture 6

Recall the Sylow theorems:

- $p$ groups exist for *every* $p^i$ dividing $\abs{G}$, and $H(p) \normal H(p^2) \normal \cdots H(p^n)$.
- All Sylow $p\dash$subgroups are conjugate.
- Numerical constraints
  - $r_p \cong 1 \mod p$,
  - $r_p \divides \abs{G}$ and $r_p \divides m$,


## Internal Direct Products

Suppose $H, K \leq G$, and consider the smallest subgroup containing both $H$ and $K$. Denote this $H \vee K$.

If either $H$ or $K$ is normal in $G$, then we have $H\vee K = HK$. There's a "recipe" for proving you have a direct product of groups:

Lemma:
Let $G$ be a group, $H \normal G$ and $K\normal G$, and

1. $H\vee K = HK = G$,
2. $H \intersect K = \theset{e}$.

Then $G \cong H \times K$.

Proof:

We first want to show that $hk = kh ~\forall k\in K, h\in H$. We then have
$$
hkh\inv k\inv = (hkh\inv)k\inv \in K = h(kh\inv k\inv) \in H \implies hkh\inv k\inv \in H\intersect K = \theset{e}.
$$
So define
\[
\begin{align*}
\phi: H \cross K \to G \\
(h, k) \mapsto hk
,\end{align*}
\]
and (exercise) check that this is a homomorphism, it is surjective, and injective.

Applications:

Theorem:
Every group of order $p^2$ is abelian.

Proof:
If $G$ is cyclic, then it is abelian and $G \cong \ZZ_{p^2}$. So suppose otherwise. By Cauchy, there is an element of order $p$ in $G$. So let $H = \generators{a}$, for which we have $\abs{H} = p$.

Then $H \normal G$ by Sylow 1, since it's normal in $H(p^2)$, which would have to equal $G$.

Now consider $b\not\in H$. By Lagrange, we must have $o(b) = 1, p$, and since $e\in H$, we must have $o(b) = p$ (uses fact that $G$ is not cyclic). Now let $K = \generators{b}$. Then $\abs{K} = p$, and $K \normal G$ by the same argument.

Theorem:
Let $\abs{G} = pq$ where $q\neq 1 \mod p$ and $p < q$. Then $G$ is cyclic (and thus abelian).

Proof:
Use Sylow 1. Let $P$ be a sylow $p\dash$subgroup. We want to show that $P \normal G$ to apply our direct product lemma, so it suffices to show $r_p = 1$.

We know $r_p = 1 \mod p$ and $r_p \divides \abs{G} = pq$, and so $r_p = 1,q$. It can't be $q$ because $p < q$.

Now let $Q$ be a sylow $q\dash$subgroup. Then $r_q \cong 1 \mod 1$ and $r_q \divides pq$, so $r_q = 1, q$. But since $p< q$, we must have $r_q = 1$. So $Q \normal G$ as well.

We now have $P \intersect Q = \emptyset$ (why?) and
$$
\abs{PQ} = \frac{\abs P \abs Q}{ \abs{P \intersect Q} } = \abs P \abs Q = pq,
$$

and so $G = PQ$, and $G \cong \ZZ_p \cross \ZZ_q \cong \ZZ_{pq}$.

Example: every group of order $15 = 5^1 3^1$ is cyclic.

We still need to justify 6, 8, and 10.

## Free Groups

Define an *alphabet* $A = \theset{a_1, a_2, \cdots a_n}$,
and let a *syllable* be of the form $a_i^m$ for some $m$.
A *word* is any expression of the form $\prod_{n_i} a_{n_i}^{m_i}$.

We have two operations,

- Concatenation, i.e. $(a_1 a_2) \star (a_3^2 a_5) = a_1 a_2 a_3^2 a_5$.
- Contraction, i.e. $(a_1 a_2^2) \star (a_2\inv a_5) = a_1 a_2^2 a_2\inv a_5 = a_1 a_2 a_5$.

If we've contracted a word as much as possible, we say it is *reduced*.

We let $F[A]$ be the set of reduced words and define a binary operation
\[
\begin{align*}
f: F[A] \cross F[A] &\to F[A] \\
(w_1, w_2) &\mapsto w_1 w_2 \text{ (reduced) }
.\end{align*}
\]
Theorem: $(A, f)$ is a group.

Definition:
$F[A]$ is called the *free group generated by $A$*. A group $G$ is called *free* on a subset $A \subseteq G$ iff $G \cong F[A]$.

Examples:

1. $A = \theset{x} \implies F[A] = \theset{x^n \suchthat n \in \ZZ} \cong \ZZ$.
2. $A = \theset{xy} = \ZZ \ast \ZZ$ (not defined yet!). Note that there are not relations, i.e. $xyxyxy$ is reduced. To abelianize, we'd need to introduce a relation $xy = yx$.



Properties:

1. If $G$ is free on $A$ and free on $B$ then we must have $\abs A = \abs B$.
2. Any (nontrivial) subgroup of a free group is free.
	(See Fraleigh or Hungerford for possible Algebraic proofs!)

Theorem:
Let $G$ be generated by some (possibly infinite) subset $A = \theset{A_i}{i\in I}$ and $G'$ be generated by some $A_i' \subseteq A_i$. Then

(a) There is at most one homomorphism $a_i \to a_i'$.

(b) If $G \cong F[A]$, there is exactly *one* homomorphism.

Corollary:
Every group $G'$ is a homomorphic image of a free group.

Proof:

Let $A$ be the generators of $G'$ and $G = F[A]$, then define $\varphi(a_i) = a_i$. This is onto exactly because $G' = \generators{a_i}$, and using the theorem above we're done.

## Generators and Relations

Let $G$ be a group and $A \subseteq G$ be a generating subset so $G = \generators{a \mid a\in A}$.
There exists a $\phi: F[A] \surjects G$, and by the first isomorphism theorem, we have $F[A] / \ker \phi \cong G$.

Let $R = \ker \phi$, these provide the *relations*.

Examples:

Let $G = \ZZ_3 = \generators{[1]_3}$. Let $x = [1]_3$, then define $\phi: F[\theset{x}] \surjects \ZZ_3$, then since $[1] + [1] + [1] = [0] \mod 3$, we have $\ker \phi = \generators{x^3}$.

Let $G = \ZZ \oplus \ZZ$, then $G \cong \generators{x,y \mid [x,y] = 1}$.


> We'll use this for groups of order 6 -- there will be only one presentation that is nonabelian, and we'll exhibit such a group.

# Lecture 7 (Thursday 29th)

Recall the table of distinct small groups we had:

| Order of G 	| Number of Groups 	| List of Distinct Groups                    	|

> Exercise: show that groups of order $p^2$ are abelian.

We still need to justify $S_3, D_4, Q, D_5$.

Recall that for any group $A$, we can consider the free group on the elements of $A$, $F[A]$. (Note that we can also restrict $A$ to just its generators.)
There is then a homomorphism $F[A] \to A$, where the kernel is the relations.

Example:
$\ZZ \ast \ZZ = \generators{x, y \mid xyx\inv y\inv = e}$ where $x = (1, 0), y = (0, 1)$.


## Groups of Order 6

Let $G$ be nonabelian of order $6$. Idea: look at subgroups of index 2.

Let $P$ be a Sylow 3-subgroup of $G$, then $r_3 = 1$ so $P\normal G$. Moreover, $P$ is cyclic since it is order 3, so $P = \generators{a}$. But since $\abs{G/P} = 2$, it is also cyclic, so $G/P = \generators{bP}$.

Note that $b\not\in P$, but $b^2 \in P$ since $(bP)^2 = P$, so $b^2 \in \theset{e, a, a^2}$. If $b=a, a^2$ then $b$ has order 6, but this would make $G = \generators{b}$ cyclic and thus abelian. So $b^2=1$.

Since $P \normal G$, we have $bPb\inv = P$, and in particular $bab\inv$ has order 3. So either $bab\inv = a$, or $bab\inv = a^2$. If $bab\inv = a$, then $G$ is abelian, so $bab\inv = a^2$.

So $G = \generators{a, b \mid a^3 = e, b^2 = e, bab\inv = a^2}$.

We've shown that *if* there is such a nonabelian group, then it must satisfy these relations -- we still need to produce some group that actually realizes this.

Consider the symmetries of the triangle:

![Image](figures/2019-09-03-09:52.png)

You can check that $a,b$ satisfy the appropriate relations.

For order 10, a similar argument yields

$G = \generators{a, b \mid a^5 = 1, b^2 = 1, ba=a^4b}$, and this is realized by symmetries of the pentagon where $a = (1~2~3~4~5), b=(1~4)(2~3)$.

## Groups of Order 8

Assume $G$ is nonabelian of order 8. $G$ has no elements of order 8, so the only possibilities are 1, 2, 4.

Assume all elements have order 1,2. Let $a,b\in G$, consider $(ab)^2 = abab \implies ab=b\inv a\inv = ba$, so $G$ is abelian. So there must be an element of order 4.

So suppose $a\in G$ has order 4, which is an index 2 subgroup, and so $\generators{a} \normal G$. But $\abs{G/\generators a} = 2$ is cyclic, so $G/\generators a = \generators{bH}$.

Note that $b^2 \in H = \generators a$.

If $b^2=a, a^3$ then $b$ will have order 8, making $G$ cyclic. So $b^2 = 1, a^2$ (these are both valid options!)

Since $H \normal G$, we have $b\generators a b\inv = \generators a$, and since $a$ has order 4, so does $bab\inv$. So $bab\inv = a, a^3$, but $a$ is not an option because this would make $G$ abelian.

So we have two options:
\[
\begin{align*}
G_1 = \generators{a, b \mid a^4 = 1, b^2=1, bab\inv = a^3} \\
G_2 = \generators{a, b \mid a^4 = 1, b^2 = a^2, bab\inv = a^3}
.\end{align*}
\]

Exercise: prove $G_1 \not\cong G_2$.

Now to realize these groups: $G_1$ is the group of symmetries of the square, where $a = (1~2~3~4), b=(1~3)$.

$G_2 \cong Q$, the quaternions, where $Q = \theset{\pm 1,\pm i, \pm j, \pm k}$.

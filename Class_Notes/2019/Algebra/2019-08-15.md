Definition: A *group* is an ordered pair $(G, \wait: G\cross G \to G)$ where $G$ is a set and $\wait$ is a binary operation, which satisfies the following axioms:

1. Associativity: $(g_1 g_2)g_3 = g_1(g_2 g_3)$
2. Identity: $\exists e\in G \suchthat  ge = eg = g$
3. Inverses: $g\in G \implies \exists h\in G \suchthat gh = gh = e$.

Some examples of groups:

- $(\ZZ, +)$
- $(\QQ, +)$
- $(\QQ\units, \times)$
- $(\RR\units, \times)$
- ($\GL(n, \RR), \times)$
- $(S_n, \circ)$

Definition: A subset $S \subseteq G$ is a *subgroup* of $G$ iff

1. $s_1, s_2 \in S \implies s_1 s_2 \in S$
2. $e\in S$
3. $s\in S \implies s\inv \in S$

We denote such a subgroup $S \leq G$.

Examples:

- $(\ZZ, +) \leq (\QQ, +)$

- Principal Ideal Domain: A ring $R$ in which every ideal $I \normal R$ is generated by a single element, i.e. $I = \generators{r}$ for some $r\in R$. Examples: $\ZZ, F[x]$ the polynomial ring over a field, $F[[x]]$ formal power series over a field, $F[x, x\inv]$ Laurent series over a field, $\ZZ_{(p)} = \theset{x = \frac a b \in \QQ \suchthat p\not\divides b}$ (localization at $p$), the $p\dash$adic integers $\RR[x,y]/(y-x^3)$. Non-example: $F[x_1, x_2, \cdots x_n]$ for $n\geq 2$,
$\RR[x,y]/(y^2-x^3)$, $\ZZ[\sqrt{-5}]$.

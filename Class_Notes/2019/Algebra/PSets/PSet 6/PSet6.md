## Problem 2
We can note that since $f$ has 4 roots, the Galois group $G$ of its splitting field will be a subgroup of $S_4$.
Moreover, $G$ must be a *transitive subgroup* of $S_4$, i.e. the action of $G$ on the roots of $f$ should be transitive.
This reduces the possibilities to $G \cong S^4, A^4, D^4, \ZZ_4, \ZZ_2^2$.

Since $f$ has exactly 2 real roots and thus a pair of roots that are complex conjugates, the automorphism given by complex conjugation is an element of $G$.
But this corresponds to a 2-cycle $\tau = (ab)$, and we can then make the following conclusions:

- Not $A_4$: $A_4$ contains only even cycles, and $\tau$ is odd.
- Not $Z_4$: This subgroup is generated by a single 4-cycle $\sigma$, which up to conjugacy is $(1234)$, and $\sigma^n$ is not a 2-cycle for any $n$.
- Not $\ZZ_2^2$: In order to be transitive, this subgroup must be $\theset{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}$, which does not contain $\tau$.

The only remaining possibilities are $S^4$ and $D^4$. $\qed$

## Problem 3

### Part 1

To see that $\phi(n)$ is even for all $n>2$, we can take a prime factorization of $n$ and write
$$
\phi(n) = \phi\left( \prod_{i=1}^m p_i^{k_i}\right) = \prod_{i=1}^m \phi(p_i^{k_i}) = \prod_{i=1}^m p^{k_i - 1}(p - 1) = \prod_{i=1}^m p^{k_i - 1} \prd_{i=1}^m (p - 1)
$$

where each $k_i \geq 1 \implies k_i-1 \geq 0$. But every prime power is odd, and $p-1$ is even for every prime, so

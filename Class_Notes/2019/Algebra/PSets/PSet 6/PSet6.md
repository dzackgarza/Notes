## Problem 2
We can note that since $f$ has 4 roots, the Galois group $G$ of its splitting field will be a subgroup of $S_4$.
Moreover, $G$ must be a *transitive subgroup* of $S_4$, i.e. the action of $G$ on the roots of $f$ should be transitive.
This reduces the possibilities to $G = S^4, A^4, D^4, \ZZ_4, \ZZ_2^2$.

Since $f$ has exactly 2 real roots and thus a pair of roots that are complex conjugates, the automorphism given by complex conjugation is an element of $G$.
But this corresponds to a 2-cycle $\tau = (ab)$, and we can then make the following conclusions:

- Not $A_4$: $A_$ contains only even cycles, and $\tau$ is odd.
- Not $Z_4$: This subgroup is generated by a single 4-cycle $\sigma$, which up to conjugacy is $(1234)$, and $\sigma^n$ is not a 2-cycle for any $n$.
- Not $\ZZ_2^2$: In order to be transitive, this subgroup must be $\theset{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}$, which does not contain $\tau$.

## Problem 2
We can note that since $f$ has 4 roots, the Galois group $G$ of its splitting field will be a subgroup of $S_4$.
Moreover, $G$ must be a *transitive subgroup* of $S_4$, i.e. the action of $G$ on the roots of $f$ should be transitive.
This reduces the possibilities to $G \cong S^4, A^4, D^4, \ZZ_4, \ZZ_2^2$.

Since $f$ has exactly 2 real roots and thus a pair of roots that are complex conjugates, the automorphism given by complex conjugation is an element of $G$.
But this corresponds to a 2-cycle $\tau = (ab)$, and we can then make the following conclusions:

- Not $A_4$: $A_4$ contains only even cycles, and $\tau$ is odd.
- Not $Z_4$: This subgroup is generated by a single 4-cycle $\sigma$, which up to conjugacy is $(1234)$, and $\sigma^n$ is not a 2-cycle for any $n$.
- Not $\ZZ_2^2$: In order to be transitive, this subgroup must be $\theset{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}$, which does not contain $\tau$.

The only remaining possibilities are $S^4$ and $D^4$. $\qed$

## Problem 3

### Part 1

To see that $\phi(n)$ is even for all $n>2$, we can take a prime factorization of $n$ and write
$$
\phi(n) = \phi\left( \prod_{i=1}^m p_i^{k_i}\right) = \prod_{i=1}^m \phi(p_i^{k_i}) = \prod_{i=1}^m p^{k_i - 1}(p - 1) = \prod_{i=1}^m p^{k_i - 1} \prod_{i=1}^m (p - 1)
$$

where each $k_i \geq 1 \implies k_i-1 \geq 0$. But every prime power is odd, and a product of odd numbers is odd, so the first product is odd.
It is also true that $p-1$ is even for every prime $p$, and the second term is a product of even terms and thus even.
So $\phi(n)$ is the product of an even and an odd number, which is always even.


### Part 2
Suppose $\phi(n) = 2$. Take a prime factorization of $n$, so we have
$$
2 = \phi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^m \phi(p_i^{k_i}) 
$$

Since the only factors of 2 are 1 and 2, we must have $\phi(p_i^{k_i}) = 2$ for exactly one $i$, and the rest must be equal to 1.

Consider the term that equals 2. We have $\phi(p_i^{k_i}) = p^{k_i - 1}(p-1) = 2$, so we must have either

- Case 1: $p-1 = 2$ and $p^{k_i - 1} = 1$, so $p=3$ and $k_i = 1$. So $3 \divides n$, but $3^\ell$ does *not* divide $n$ for any $\ell > 1$.
- Case 2: $p^{k_i - 1} = 2$ and $(p-1) = 1$, so $p=2$ and $k_i = 2$. Thus $2^2$ divides $n$ but $2^\ell$ does not for any $\ell > 2$.

In either case, it remains to check are whether the other factors where $\phi(p_j^{k_j}) = 1$ can contribute any other distinct divisors to $n$.
We can note that $\phi(p_j^{k_j}$ iff $p^{k_j-1}(p-1) = 1$, so this forces $p=2$ and $k_j = 1$. So $n$ may or may not contain a single factor of 2, but by uniqueness of prime factorization, this can only happen in case 1.
Note that this also forces $2\divides n$ but $2^2$ does not divide $n$.

In summary, we've found that $\phi(n) = 2$ implies that 

- $3 \divides n, 9\not\divides n$, and
  - $2\divides n, 4\not\divides n$
  - $2\not\divides n$
- $2^2 \divides n, 2^3 \not\divides n$.

This reduces the possibilities to the finite set $n \in \theset{6,3,4}$, and $\phi(6) = \phi(3) = \phi(4) = 2$. $\qed$

## Problem 4

Suppose $F = K[\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n]$ where $\alpha_1^{n_1} \in K$ for some $n_1$ and }or each $i$ we have $\alpha_i^{n_i} \in K[\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}]$ for some powers $n_i$.
We want to show that $F = E[\beta_1, \cdots \beta_m]$ where each $\beta_i$ satisfy a similar condition.

Let $A = \theset{\alpha_i \suchthat \alpha_i \not\in E}$, then it is since $E \injects F$, adjoining all elements of $A$ to $E$ will yield exactly $F$.

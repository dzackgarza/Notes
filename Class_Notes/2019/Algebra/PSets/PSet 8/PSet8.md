# Problem 1

## Part a

Define a map

$$
\mathrm{ev}: \hom_R(\ZZ_m, A) \to A \\
(f: \ZZ_m \to A) \mapsto f(1)
$$

Then noting that $\mathrm{ev}$ is a homomorphism, forcing $f(\overline 0) = 0_A$ (where $\overline 0: \ZZ_m \to A$ is the zero map), we must have
$$
0 = f(0) = f(m) = m f(1),
$$

we must have $mf(1) = 0$ in $A$, i.e. $

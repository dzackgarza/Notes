# Problem 1

## Part a

Define a map

$$
\phi_\mathrm{ev}: \hom_\ZZ(\ZZ_m, A) \to A \\
(f: \ZZ_m \to A) \mapsto f(1)
$$

Then $\phi_\mathrm{ev}$ is a $\ZZ\dash$module homomorphism, since

\[
\begin{align*}
\phi_\mathrm{ev}(f + g) 
&= (f + g)(1) \\
&= f(1) + g(2) \\
&= \phi_\mathrm{ev}(f) + \phi_\mathrm{ev}(g)
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
\phi_\mathrm{ev}(nf) &= (nf)(1) \\
&\definedas n f(1) \\
&= n ~\phi_\mathrm{ev}(f)
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
\end{align*}
\]

But this forces $f(\overline 0) = 0_A$ (where $\overline 0: \ZZ_m \to A$ is the zero map), we have
$$
0 = f(0) = f(m) = m f(1),
$$

we must have $mf(1) = 0$ in $A$. So 
$$
\im \phi_\mathrm{ev} = \theset{a\in A \mid ma = 0} \definedas A[m].
$$

It is also the case that
\begin{align*}
\ker \phi_{\mathrm{ev}} &= \theset{f \in \hom_\ZZ(\ZZ_m, A) \mid f(1) = 0} = \theset{\overline 0},
\end{align*}

which follows from the fact that $\ZZ_m = \generators{1 \mod m}$ and $A = \generators{1_A}$ as $\ZZ\dash$modules, so if $f(1 \mod m) = 0_A$ then 
$$
f(n \mod m) = nf( 1 \mod m) = 0
$$ 

and so $f$ is necessarily the zero map. So $\ker \phi = \overline 0$. 

We can then apply the first isomorphism theorem,
$$
\frac{\hom_\ZZ(\ZZ_m, A)}{\ker \phi_{\mathrm{ev}}} \cong \im \phi_{\mathrm{ev}} \implies \hom_\ZZ(\ZZ_m, A) \cong A[m].
$$

## Part 2

**Lemma:**
If $x \divides n$ and $x\divides m$ then $x\divides \gcd(m, n)$

*Proof:*
We have $x\divides km + \ell n$ for any integers $k, \ell$. So let $d = \gcd(m, n)$, then there exist integers $a, b$ such that $am + bn = d$. But we can now just take $k=a$ and $\ell = b$. $\qed$

We claim that $\ZZ_n[m] \cong \ZZ_{(m, n)}$, from which the result immediately follows by part 1.

Define a map
\[
\begin{align*}
\phi: \ZZ &\to \ZZ_n[m] \\ 
1 &\mapsto [1]_{\mod n}
.\end{align*}
\]

The claim is that this is an isomorphism.

Then $\phi$ is clearly surjective (since $\ZZ\to \ZZ_n$ is a quotient map and $\ZZ_n[m]$ is a subgroup of $\ZZ_n$) and if we let $d \definedas \gcd(m, n)$, we have

\[
\begin{align*}
\ker \phi &= \theset{x\in \ZZ_n \suchthat  mx = 0} \\
&= \theset{x \in \ZZ_n \suchthat x \divides m} \\
&= \theset{x \in \ZZ \suchthat x \divides n ~\text{ and }~ x \divides m} \\
&= \theset{x \in \ZZ \suchthat x \divides d} \quad \text{by the lemma} \\
&= d\ZZ~
.\end{align*}
\]


Then by the first isomorphism theorem, we have
$$
\frac{\ZZ}{\ker \phi} \cong \im \phi \implies \frac{\ZZ}{\gcd(m, n)\ZZ} \definedas \ZZ_{\gcd(m, n)} \cong \ZZ_n[m].
$$

## Part 3

Let $f\in \ZZ^* = \hom_\ZZ(\ZZ_m, \ZZ)$, so $f: \ZZ_m \to \ZZ$. 
These are both $\ZZ\dash$modules generated by their identity elements, so such a map is determined by where it send $[1]_{\mod m}$.

So let $f([1]_{\small \mod m}) = n \in \ZZ$.
Since $f$ is a module homomorphism, we have $f([0]_{\small \mod m}) = 0$, and in particular we have
\[
\begin{align*}
0 &= f([0]_{\small \mod m}) \\
&= f([m]_{\small \mod m}) \\
&= f([1 m]_{\small \mod m}) \\
&= m f([1]_{\small \mod m}),
\end{align*}
\]

which forces $f([1]) \in \ZZ[m] = \theset{0}$, so $f$ must be the zero map and $\ZZ^* = 0$.

> Note: $\ZZ[m] = 0$ because $\ZZ$ is an integral domain, so $mx = 0$ forces $m=0$ or $x=0$.

## Part 4

To see that $\ZZ_m$ is a $\ZZ_{mk}$ module, we define an action

\begin{align*}
\ZZ_{mk} &\actson \ZZ_{m} \\
[x]_{mk} \actson [y]_m &\definedas [xy]_m
\end{align*}

**This is a well-defined action**:

If $[x_1]_{mk} = [x_2]_{mk}$ are two representatives of the same equivalence class, then 
$$
[x_1]_{mk} - [x_2]_{mk} = [x_1-x_2]_{mk} = [0]_{mk} \implies m \divides x_1 - x_2.
$$ 

But then
\begin{align*}
([x_1]_{mk}\actson [y]_m) - ([x_2]_{mk} \actson [y]_m) 
&= [x_1 y]_m - [x_2 y]_m \\
&= [(x_1 - x_2)y]_m \\
&= [0]_m,
\end{align*}

which shows that their resulting actions on $\ZZ_m$ are equal.



**This action yields a module structure:**

- $r.(x+y) = r.x + r.y$:
$$
[r]_{mk} \actson ([x]_m + [y]_m)  = [r]_{mk} \actson [x+y]_m = [r(x+y)]_m = [rx]_m + [ry]_m.
$$

- $(r+s).x = r.x + s.x$: 
$$
[r]_{mk} + [s]_{mk} \actson [x]_m = [r + s]_{mk} \actson [x]_m = [(r+s)x]_m = [rx]_m + [sx]_m.
$$

- $(rs).x = r.s.x$:
\begin{align*}
[r]_{mk} \cdot [s]_{mk} \actson [x]_m 
&= [rs]_{mk} \actson [x]_m \\
&= [(rs)x]_m  \\
&= [r]_{mk} \actson [sx]_m \\
&= [r]_{mk} \actson ( [s]_{mk} \actson [x]_m).
\end{align*}

- $1.x = x$:
$$
[1]_{mk} \actson [x]_m = [1x]_m = [x]_m.
$$

$\ZZ_m^* \definedas \hom_{\ZZ_{mk}}(\ZZ_m, \ZZ_{mk}) \cong \ZZ_m$:

Define a map
\begin{align*}
\phi: \hom_{\ZZ_{mk}}(\ZZ_m, \ZZ_{mk}) &\to \ZZ_m \\
f \mapsto [f([1]_m)]_m
\end{align*}

**$\phi$ is a homomorphism**, as

\[
\begin{align*}
\phi(f + g) &= [(f+g)([1]_m)]_m = [f([1]_m) + g([1]_m)]_m  = [f([1]_m)]_m + [g([1]_m)]_m, \\
\phi([r]_{mk} \actson f) &= [[r]_{mk} f([1]_m)]_m = [r]_m \cdot [f([1]_m)]_m = [r]_{mk}\actson \phi(f).
\end{align*}
\]

**$\phi$ is injective**, as $[f([1]_m)]_m = [0]_m$, then for any $1 \leq \ell \leq m$, we have
$$
[f([\ell]_m)]_m = [\ell f([1]_m)]_m = \ell [f([1]_m)]_m = \ell[0]_m = [0]_m,
$$

so $f$ must be the zero map.

**$\phi$ is surjective**, since if $[\ell]_m \in \ZZ_m$, we can define
\[
\begin{align*}
f_\ell: \ZZ_m &\to \ZZ_{mk} \\
[1]_m &\mapsto [\ell]_{mk}
\end{align*}
\]

which makes sense and is well-defined because $\ZZ_m \injects \ZZ_{mk}$, and the map is defined on the generator.

So we have the desired bijection. $\qed$

# Problem 2

We have the map

\[
\begin{align*}
\pi: \ZZ &\to \ZZ_2 \\
x &\mapsto [x]_2
\end{align*}
\]

which is a surjection and thus an epimorphism in the category ${\ZZ}\dash\mathrm{Mod}$, and if we apply the functor $\hom_\ZZ(\ZZ_2, \wait)$ to $\pi$ we obtain an induced map

\[
\begin{align*}
\overline{\pi}: \hom_{\ZZ}(\ZZ_2, \ZZ) &\to \hom_{\ZZ}(\ZZ_2, \ZZ_2) \\
f &\mapsto \pi \circ f 
.\end{align*}
\]

The claim is that $\overline{\pi}$ is *not* a surjection, and thus not an epimorphism (in the same category).

To see that this is the case, we can simply note that $\hom_\ZZ(\ZZ_2, \ZZ) = 0$ by part 3 of Problem 1, whereas $\hom_\ZZ(\ZZ_2, \ZZ_2) \neq 0$. 

For example, one can define $\id_{\ZZ_2}: \ZZ_2 \to \ZZ_2,~ [x]_2 \to [x]_2$, which is a nontrivial module homomorphisms. 

So any such $f$ appearing must be the zero map, and thus $\overline{\pi}$ is also the zero map. $\qed$

# Problem 3

Let $f: R \to R$ be an endomorphism of $R$ in the category of rings. 
We can then check that for any $r\in R$, we have $f(r) = f(r 1_R) = rf(1_R)$, which says that $f$ is given by right-multiplication by some fixed element $x_f \definedas f(1_R)$, i.e.
\[
\begin{align*}
f: R &\to R \\
r &\mapsto r \cdot x_f
\end{align*}
\]

and so we can attempt to define 
\[
\begin{align*}
\phi_1: \hom_R(R, R) &\to R \\
f &\mapsto x_f \definedas f(1_R)
\end{align*}
\]

We can check that 
$$
(g\circ f(r)) = g(f(r)) = g(r\cdot x_f) = r \cdot x_f \cdot x_g,
$$

which shows that in fact 
$$
\phi(g \circ f) = x_f \cdot x_g,
$$
which reverses the multiplication. So the correct codomain is $R^{op}$, and we amend the definition:
\[
\begin{align*}
\phi_2: \hom_R(R, R) &\to R^{op} \\
f &\mapsto x_f \definedas f(1_R)
\end{align*}
\]

By construction, **$\phi_s$ is a ring homomorphism**. If $R$ is commutative, then $x_f \cdot x_g = x_g \cdot x_f$, which makes $\phi_1$ a ring homomorphism as well. It remains to check that it is an isomorphism/

**$\phi_1$ is in injective**: We can check that $\ker \phi_1 = 0$ as a ring. To that end, suppose $\phi_1(f) = x_f = 0$. Then $f(r) = r \cdot 0 = 0$, so $f$ can only be the zero map.

**$\phi_1$ is surjective**: Let $x\in R$ be arbitrary, then we can define $f: R \to R$ by $f(1_R) = x$, so $f(r) = r\cdot x$. This is an endomorphism of $R$, and thus an element of $\hom_R(R, R)$.

By the first isomorphism theorem for rings, we thus have $\hom_R(R, R) \cong R$.
$\qed$

# Problem 4

We have maps

\[
\begin{align*}
\theta_A: A &\to (A\dual)\dual \\
a &\mapsto (\mathrm{ev}_a: f \mapsto f(a) )
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
\theta_B: B &\to (B\dual)\dual \\
b &\mapsto (\mathrm{ev}_b: g \mapsto g(b) )
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
f: A &\to B \\
a &\mapsto f(a)
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
f\dual: B\dual &\to A\dual \\
g &\mapsto g \circ f
\end{align*}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
f^{\vee\vee}: A^{\vee\vee} &\to B^{\vee\vee} \\
h &\mapsto h \circ f\dual
\end{align*}
\]

We can now check that $f^{\vee\vee} \circ \theta_A = \theta_B \circ f$ as maps from $A$ to $B^{\vee\vee}$. Letting $a\in A$, and $h\in B^{\vee\vee}$ (so $h: B\dual \to R$), we will show that both maps act on $h$ in the same way.

For notational convenience, write $\phi \actson h \definedas h\circ \phi$. We then have

\[
\begin{align*}
(f^{\vee\vee} \circ \theta_A)(a) \actson h 
&\definedas f^{\vee\vee}(\theta_A(a)) \actson h \\
&\definedas f^{\vee\vee}(\mathrm{ev}_a)\actson h \\
&=(\mathrm{ev}_a \circ f\dual)\actson h \\
&\definedas h \circ (\mathrm{ev}_a  \circ f) \\
&\definedas h(f(a)) \\
&= \mathrm{ev}_{f(a)}\actson h \\
&\definedas \theta_B(f(a))\actson h \\
&\definedas (\theta_B \circ f)(a)\actson h,
\end{align*}
\]

which shows that these actions agree, and thus the diagram commutes.

# Problem 5

Let $E$ be a free module over $R$ an integral domain. 
Then $E$ has a basis $\theset{\vector e_i} \subseteq F$, so if $x \neq 0 \in E$, we have
$$
x = \sum_i r_i \vector e_i
$$

where each $r_i \in R$. Moreover, since $x\neq 0$, at least one $r_i \neq 0$, so let $r_j$ denote one of the nonzero coefficients.

Now suppose $x$ is a torsion element, so $mx = 0$ for some $m\neq 0 \in E$. We can then write
$$
mx = m\sum_i r_i \vector e_i = \sum_i mr_i \vector e_i = 0
$$

But by linear independence, this forces $mr_i = 0$ for all $i$. 
In particular, $mr_j = 0$ where $r_j \neq 0$.
But this exhibits either $m$ or $r_j$ as a zero divisor, and since the only zero divisor in an integral domain is zero, we must have $m=0$ or $r_j = 0$, a contradiction.

So $x$ can not be a torsion element. But since $x \in E$ was arbitrary, $E$ must be torsion-free.

For an example of a torsion-free module over an integral domain that is *not* free, consider $\QQ$ as a $\ZZ\dash$module. Then $\QQ$ is clearly torsion-free, since it is an integral domain and the same argument as above applies. 

But $\QQ$ is not free as $\ZZ\dash$module. Supposing that $\mathcal B =\theset{\vector b_1, \vector b_2, \cdots} \subset \QQ$ was a $\ZZ\dash$basis, consider $\vector b_1 = \frac {p_1} {q_1}$ and $\vector b_2 = \frac {p_2} {q_2}$. 
Then $\vector b_1, \vector b_2$ can not be linearly independent over $\ZZ$, which follows from the fact that
$$
q_1 p_2 \vector b_1 + q_2 p_1 \vector b_2 = p_2 p_1 - p_1 p_2 = 0, 
$$

while $q_1 p_2, ~q_2 p_1 \neq 0 \in \ZZ$. 
$\qed$

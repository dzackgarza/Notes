# Regular Problems

## Problem 1

We want to show that $G$ has a non-trivial normal subgroup, noting that $\# G = p^2 q$ where $p=2, q=3$, we will proceed by showing that either $n_p$ or $n_q$ must be 1.

We immediate note that we have
\[
\begin{align*}
n_p \equiv 1 \mod p &\quad& n_q \equiv 1 \mod q \\
n_p \divides q &\quad& n_q \divides p^2
,\end{align*}
\]

which immediately forces 
$$
n_p \in \theset{1, q}, \quad n_1 \in \theset{1, p, p^2}.
$$

Proceeding by cases:

### Case 1: $p = q$.

Then $\# G = p^3$ and $G$ is a $p\dash$group. 
But every $p\dash$group has a non-trivial center $Z(G) \leq G$, and the center is always a normal subgroup.

### Case 2: $p > q$.

In this case we have

# Problem 1

## Part (a)

Definition: A field extension $L/F$ is said to be a *splitting field* of a polynomial $f(x)$ if $L$ contains all roots of $f$ and thus decomposes as 
$$
f(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n (x - \alpha_i)^{k_i} \in L[x]
$$
where $\alpha_i$ are the distinct roots of $f$ and $k_i$ are the respective multiplicities.

## Part (b)

\begin{problem}[Hungerford 1.6.3]
If $\sigma = (i_1 i_2 \cdots i_r) \in S_n$ and $\tau \in S_n$, then show that $\tau\sigma\tau^{-1} = (\tau(i_1) \tau(i_2) \cdots \tau(i_r))$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Let
  $$\sigma = (s_1 s_2 \cdots s_r) \in S_n$$
  in cycle notation, and $\tau \in S_n$ be arbitrary. Define $t_j = \tau(s_j)$; we would then like to show that $$\tau\sigma\tau\inv = (t_1 t_2 \cdots t_r) \coloneqq (\tau(s_1) \tau(s_2) \cdots \tau(s_r))$$

  To this end, it suffices to show that $t_i$ maps to $t_{i+1 \mod r}$, under $\tau\sigma\tau\inv$, which is to say
  $$
  \tau\sigma\tau\inv(t_i) =
  \begin{cases}
    t_{i+1} & i+1 \leq r, \\
    t_1 & i = r
  \end{cases}.
  $$

  Bearing this in mind, we will immediately suppress notation and take all indices $\mod r$ for the rest of this problem.

  The following then follows simply by definitions:
  \begin{align*}
  \tau\sigma\tau\inv(t_i) &= \tau\sigma(s_i) \\
                          &= \tau(s_{i+1}) \\
                          &= t_{i+1}
  .\end{align*}
  \qed

\begin{problem}[Hungerford 1.6.4]
\label{prob:1.2}
Show that $S_n \cong \left\langle (12), (123\cdots n)\right\rangle$ and also that $S_n \cong \left\langle (12), (23\cdots n)\right\rangle$
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Let $\sigma= (12)$ and $\tau= (123\cdots n)$.

  Claim: $S_n$ is generated by \textit{swaps} $F = \theset{f_{i, k} = (i \quad i+k) \mid 1 \leq i, k \leq n} = \generators{f_{i, k}}$, and moreover each such swap can be written as a product in $\sigma$ and $\tau$, and thus
  $$
  S_n = F \subseteq \generators{\sigma, \tau} \subseteq S_n
  $$
  which forces $\generators{\sigma, \tau} = S_n$ as desired.

  To see that $F = S_n$, let $(s_1 s_2 \cdots s_r) \in S_n$ be arbitrary. We then construct the swaps $(s_1 s_2), (s_1, s_3), \cdots (s_1 s_r)$, and note that taking their product yields
  $$
  (s_1 s_2)(s_1, s_3)\cdots(s_1 s_r) = (s_1 s_2 s_3 \cdots s_r)
  $$

  and so $F = S_n$.

  To see that $F \subseteq \generators{\sigma, \tau}$, we produce a way to write any swap as a product of powers of these generators. We can first note that for $1 \leq i \leq n$, we have $\sigma(i) = i+1$ and $\sigma^k(i) = i+k$ (where again everything is taken $\mod r$).

  By problem (1), we have
  $$
  \sigma\tau\sigma\inv = \sigma~(1 2)~\sigma\inv = (\sigma(1) ~\sigma(2)) = (2 3),
  $$

  and in general,
  $$
  \sigma^k\tau \sigma^{-k} = (\sigma^k(1) ~\sigma^k(2)) = (k\quad k+1).
  $$

  So the cycles $(k\quad k+1)$ are products of powers of $\tau, \sigma$ and thus contained in the group they generate, and we have $F \subseteq \generators{\sigma, \tau}$.

  If we then define the cycle $\gamma_k = (k\quad k+1)$, we can observe
  \begin{align*}
    \gamma_k \gamma_{k+1}\gamma_{k}\inv &= (k\quad k+1)~(k+1\quad k+2)~(k+1 \quad k) \\
    &= (k\quad k+2),
  .\end{align*}

  and so $\generators{\gamma_k}$ also contains all cycles of the form $(k\quad k+i)$ for any $i$. In particular, any swap can be written as such a cycle -- explicitly, given a swap $(s_1 s_2)$ (where without loss of generality $s_1 \leq s_2)$, let $k=s_1$ and $i = s_2 - s_1$.

  This implies that

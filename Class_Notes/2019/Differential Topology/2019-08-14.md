title: "Algebraic Topology 2: Smooth Manifolds"
---

# Lecture 1

The key point of this class will be a discussion of *smooth structures*. As you may recall, a sensational result of Milnor's exhibited exotic spheres with smooth structures -- i.e., a differentiable manifold $M$ which is homeomorphic but *not* diffeomorphic to a sphere.

Summary of this result: Look at bundles $S^3 \to X \to S^4$, then one can construct some $X \cong S^7 \in \mathbf{Top}$ but $X \not \cong S^7 \in \mathbf{Diff}^{\,\infty}$. There are in fact 7 distinct choices for $X$.

> It is not known if there are exotic smooth structures on $S^4$. The Smooth Poincare' conjecture is that these do not exist; this is believed to be false.

The other key point of this course is to show that $X \in \mathbf{Diff}^{\,\infty} \implies X \injects \RR^n$ for some $n$, and is in fact a topological subspace.

A short list of words/topics we hope to describe:

- Differentiable manifolds
- Local charts
- Submanifolds
- Projective spaces
- Lie groups
- Tangent spaces
- Vector fields
- Cotangent spaces
- Differentials of smooth mapsG
- Differential forms
- de Rham's theorem

We'd like a notion of "convergence" for, say, curves in $\RR^2$. Consider the following examples.


Note the problematic point on the bottom right, as well as the fact that neither of the usual notions of pointwise or uniform convergence will

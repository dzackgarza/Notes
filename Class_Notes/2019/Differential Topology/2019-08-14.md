# Lecture 1

The key point of this class will be a discussion of *smooth structures*. As you may recall, a sensational result of Milnor's exhibited exotic spheres with smooth structures -- i.e., a differentiable manifold $M$ which is homeomorphic but *not* diffeomorphic to a sphere.

> Summary of this result: Look at bundles $S^3 \to X \to S^4$, then one can construct some $X \cong S^7 \in \mathbf{Top}$ but $X \not \cong S^7 \in \mathbf{Diff}^{\,\infty}$. There are in fact 7 distinct choices for $X$.

> It is not known if there are exotic smooth structures on $S^4$. The Smooth Poincare' conjecture is that these do not exist; this is believed to be false.

The other key point of this course is to show that $X \in \mathbf{Diff}^{\,\infty} \implies X \injection \RR^n$ for some $n$, and is in fact a topological subspace.

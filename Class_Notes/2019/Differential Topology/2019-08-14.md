The key point of this class will be a discussion of *smooth structures*. As you may recall, a sensational result of Milnor's exhibited exotic spheres with smooth structures -- i.e., a differentiable manifold $M$ which is homeomorphic but *not* diffeomorphic to a sphere.

> Summary of this result: Look at bundles $S^3 \to X \to S^4$, where $\dim X = 7$; then there a

> It is not known if there are exotic smooth structures on $S^4$. The Smooth Poincare' conjecture is that these do not exist; this is believed to be false.

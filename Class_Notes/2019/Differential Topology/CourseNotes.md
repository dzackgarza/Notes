*Definition 1 (Tangent Vector):*

Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold and let $C^\infty(M)$ be the algebra of real-valued differentiable functions on $M$. 
Then the tangent vector to $M$ at a point $\vector x$ in the manifold is given by the *derivation* 
$$
D_{v}: C^\infty (M)\rightarrow {\mathbb  {R}}
$$ 
which shall be linear -- i.e. we have

$$
f,g \in C^\infty(M) \implies D_{v}(af+bg)=aD_{v}(f)+bD_{v}(g)
$$
Note that the derivation will by definition have the Leibniz property

{\displaystyle D_{v}(f\cdot g)=D_{v}(f)\cdot g(x)+f(x)\cdot D_{v}(g)\,.}D_{v}(f\cdot g)=D_{v}(f)\cdot g(x)+f(x)\cdot D_{v}(g)\,.

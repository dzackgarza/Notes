Definition (Tangent Vector):
Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold and let $A(M)$ be the algebra of real-valued differentiable functions on {\displaystyle M}M. Then the tangent vector to {\displaystyle M}M at a point {\displaystyle x}x in the manifold is given by the derivation {\displaystyle D_{v}:A(M)\rightarrow \mathbb {R} }D_{v}:A(M)\rightarrow {\mathbb  {R}} which shall be linear â€” i.e., for any {\displaystyle f,g\in A(M)}f,g\in A(M) and {\displaystyle a,b\in \mathbb {R} }a,b\in {\mathbb  {R}} we have

{\displaystyle D_{v}(af+bg)=aD_{v}(f)+bD_{v}(g)\,.}D_{v}(af+bg)=aD_{v}(f)+bD_{v}(g)\,.
Note that the derivation will by definition have the Leibniz property

{\displaystyle D_{v}(f\cdot g)=D_{v}(f)\cdot g(x)+f(x)\cdot D_{v}(g)\,.}D_{v}(f\cdot g)=D_{v}(f)\cdot g(x)+f(x)\cdot D_{v}(g)\,.

# Monday August 12

> The material for this class will roughly come from Humphrey, Chapters 1 to 5. There is also a useful appendix which has been uploaded to the ELC system online.

## Overview
Here is a short overview of the topics we expect to cover:

### Chapter 2
- Ideals, solvability, and nilpotency
- Semisimple Lie algebras
  - These have a particularly nice structure and representation theory
- Determining if a Lie algebra is semisimple using Killing forms
- Weyl's theorem for complete reducibility for finite dimensional representations
- Root space decompositions

### Chapter 3-4

We will describe the following series of correspondences:

```{=latex}
\begin{tikzcd}
\text{Semisimple algebras} \arrow[rr, Leftrightarrow] &  & \text{Root systems} \arrow[rr, Leftrightarrow] & & \text{Dynkin diagrams} \\
& & & & \\
\text{Simple algebras over } \CC \arrow[uu, Rightarrow, "\bigoplus"] \arrow[rr, Leftrightarrow] & & \text{Irreducible root systems} \arrow[uu, Rightarrow, "\coprod"] \arrow[rr, Leftrightarrow] & & \arrow[uu, Rightarrow, "\coprod"] \text{Connected Dynkin diagrams}
\end{tikzcd}
```

## Classification
The classical Lie algebras can be essentially classified by certain classes of diagrams:

```{=latex}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\tikzset{vertex/.style = {shape=circle,draw,minimum size=0.2em,fill=black!60}}
\tikzset{edge/.style = {->,> = latex'}}
\node at (-1,0) {$A_\ell:$};
\node[vertex] (a) at  (0,0) {};
\node[vertex] (b) at  (2,0) {};
\node[vertex] (c) at  (4,0) {};
\node[label=$\ell$, vertex] (d) at  (6,0) {};
\draw[edge] (a) to (b);
\draw[edge] (c) to (d);
\node at ($(b)!0.5!(c)$) {$\cdots$};
\end{tikzpicture}
```

```{=latex}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\tikzset{vertex/.style = {shape=circle,draw,minimum size=0.2em,fill=black!60}}
\tikzset{edge/.style = {->,> = latex'}}
\node at (-1,0) {$B_\ell:$};
\node[vertex] (a) at  (0,0) {};
\node[vertex] (b) at  (2,0) {};
\node[vertex] (c) at  (4,0) {};
\node[label=$\ell$, vertex] (d) at  (6,0) {};
\draw[edge] (a) to (b);
\draw[edge, bend left] (c) to (d);
\draw[edge, bend right] (c) to (d);
\node at ($(b)!0.5!(c)$) {$\cdots$};
\end{tikzpicture}
```

```{=latex}

\node[vertex] (a) at  (0,0) {};
\node[vertex] (b) at  (2,0) {};
\node[vertex] (c) at  (4,0) {};
\node[label=$\ell$, vertex] (d) at  (6,0) {};
\draw[edge] (a) to (b);
\draw[edge, bend left] (d) to (c);
\draw[edge, bend right] (d) to (c);
\node at ($(b)!0.5!(c)$) {$\cdots$};
\end{tikzpicture}
```

```{=latex}

\node[vertex] (c) at  (4,0) {};
\node[label=$\ell$, vertex] (d) at  (6,2) {};
\node[vertex] (e) at  (6,-2) {};
\draw[edge] (a) to (b);
\draw[edge] (c) to (d);
\draw[edge] (c) to (e);
\node at ($(b)!0.5!(c)$) {$\cdots$};
\end{tikzpicture}
```

```{=latex}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\tikzset{vertex/.style = {shape=circle,draw,minimum size=0.2em,fill=black!60}}
\tikzset{edge/.style = {->,> = latex'}}

\node[vertex] (a) at  (0,0) {};
\node[vertex] (b) at  (2,0) {};
\node[vertex] (c) at  (4,0) {};
\node[vertex] (cp) at  (4,2) {};
\node[vertex] (d) at  (6,0) {};
\node[label=$\ell$, vertex] (z) at  (8,0) {};
\draw[edge] (d) to (z);
\draw[edge] (a) to (b);
\draw[edge] (b) to (c);
\draw[edge] (c) to (cp);
%\draw[edge] (d) to (c);
\node at ($(c)!0.5!(d)$) {$\cdots$};
\end{tikzpicture}
```

```{=latex}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\tikzset{vertex/.style = {shape=circle,draw,minimum size=0.2em,fill=black!60}}
\tikzset{edge/.style = {->,> = latex'}}
\node at (-1,0) {$F_4$:};
\node[vertex] (a) at  (0,0) {};
\node[vertex] (b) at  (2,0) {};
\node[vertex] (c) at  (4,0) {};
\node[vertex] (d) at  (6,0) {};
\draw[edge] (a) to (b);
\draw[edge, bend left] (b) to (c);
\draw[edge, bend right] (b) to (c);
\draw[edge] (c) to (d);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

## Chapters 4-5
These cover the following topics:

- Conjugacy classes of Cartan subalgebras
- The PBW theorem for the universal enveloping algebra
- Serre relations

### Chapter 6

Some import topics include:

- Weight space decompositions
- Finite dimensional modules
- Character and the Harish-Chandra theorem
- The Weyl character formula
  - This will be computed for the specific Lie algebras seen earlier

We will also see the type $A_{\ell}$ algebra used for the first time; however, it differs from the other types in several important/significant ways.

### Chapter 7
Skip!

### Topics

Time permitting, we may also cover the following extra topics:

- Infinite dimensional Lie algebras [Carter 05]
- BGG Cat$\dash\mathcal O$ [Humphrey 08]

## Content

Fix $F$ a field of characteristic zero -- note that prime characteristic is closer to a research topic.

\wrapenv{\Begin{definition}}
A **Lie Algebra** $\lieg$ over $F$ is an $F\dash$vector space with an operation denoted the Lie bracket,

\[
\begin{align*}
[\wait, \wait]: \lieg \cross \lieg \to \lieg \\
(x,y) \mapsto [x, y]
.\end{align*}
\]

satisfying the following properties:

- $[\wait, \wait]$ is bilinear
- $[x, x] = 0$
- The Jacobi identity:

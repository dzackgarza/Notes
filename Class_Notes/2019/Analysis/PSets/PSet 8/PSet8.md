# Problem 1

## Part a

It follows from the definition that $\norm{f}_\infty = 0 \iff f = 0$ almost everywhere, and if $\norm{f}_\infty$ is the best upper bound for $f$ almost everywhere, then $\norm{cf}_\infty$ is the best upper bound for $cf$ almost everywhere. 

So it remains to show the triangle inequality. Suppose that $\abs{f(x)} \leq \norm{f}_\infty$ a.e. and $\abs{g(x)} \keq \norm{g}_\infty$ a.e., then by the triangle inequality for the $\abs{\cdot}_\RR$ we have

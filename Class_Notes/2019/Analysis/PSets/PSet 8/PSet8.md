# Problem 1

## Part a

It follows from the definition that $\norm{f}_\infty = 0 \iff f = 0$ almost everywhere, and if $\norm{f}_\infty$ is the best upper bound for $f$ almost everywhere, then $\norm{cf}_\infty$ is the best upper bound for $cf$ almost everywhere. 

So it remains to show the triangle inequality. We have

\[
\begin{align*}

.\end{align*}
\]

# Problem 1

## Part a

It follows from the definition that $\norm{f}_\infty = 0 \iff f = 0$ almost everywhere, and if $\norm{f}_\infty$ is the best upper bound for $f$ almost everywhere, then $\norm{cf}_\infty$ is the best upper bound for $cf$ almost everywhere. 

So it remains to show the triangle inequality. Suppose that $\abs{f(x)} \leq \norm{f}_\infty$ a.e. and $\abs{g(x)} \keq \norm{g}_\infty$ a.e., then by the triangle inequality for the $\abs{\cdot}_\RR$ we have
\[
\begin{align*}
\abs{(f + g)(x)} &\leq \abs{f(x)} + \abs{g(x)} \quad a.e. \\
&\leq \norm{f}_\infty + \norm{g}_\infty \quad a.e.
,\end{align*}
\]

which means that $\norm{f+g}_\infty \leq \norm{f}_\infty + \norm{g}_\infty$ as desired.

\begin{problem}\hfill\\
  Let $C$ denote the Cantor set.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Show that $C$ contains point that is not an endpoint of one of the removed intervals.
  \item Show that $C$ is nowhere dense, meager, and has measure zero.
  \item Show that $C$ is uncountable.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}\hfill\\
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item First we will characterize the endpoints of the removed intervals. Let $C_n$ be the $n$Th stage of the deletion process that is used to define the Cantor set; then what remains is a union of intervals:
      $$
      C_n = [0, \frac 1 {3^n}] \union [\frac 2 {2^n}, \frac 3 {3^n}] \union \cdots \union[\frac {3^n-1} n, 1],
      $$
    and so the endpoints are precisely the numbers of the form $\frac{k}{3^n}$ where $0 \leq k \leq 3^n$. Moreover, any endpoint appearing in $C_n$ is never removed in any later step, and so all endpoints remaining in $C$ are of this form where we allow $0\leq n < \infty$.

    Thus, our goal is to produce a number $x\in [0,1]$ such that $x \neq \frac k {3^n}$ for any $k$ or $n$, but also satisfies $x\in C$. So we will need a general characterization of all of the points in $C$.

    Lemma: If $x\in C$, then one can find a ternary expansion for which all of the digits are either $0$ or $2$, i.e.
    $$
    x = \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k 3^{-k} \quad \text{where } a_k \in \theset{0, 2}.
    $$

    Proof: By induction on the index $k$ in $a_k$, first consider note that if $x\in C$ then $x \in C_1 = [0, 1] \setminus [\frac 1 3, \frac 2 3]= [0, \frac 1 3] \union [\frac 2 3, 1]$. So if $x\in C_1$, then $x\not\in(\frac 1 3, \frac 2 3)$. But note that $a_1$ is computed in the following way:
    $$
    a_1 = \begin{cases}
      0 & 0 \leq x < \frac 1 3, \\
      1 & \frac 1 3 \leq x < \frac 2 3, \\
      2 & \frac 2 3 \leq x < 1.
    \end{cases}
    $$

    Since the interval $(\frac 1 3, \frac 2 3)$ is deleted in $C_1$, we find that $a_1 = 1 \iff x = \frac 1 3$. In this case, however, we claim that we can find a ternary expansion of $x$ that does not contain a $1$.  We first write
    $$
    x = \frac 1 3 = \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k 3^{-k} \quad \text{where } a_1 = 1, a_{k>1} = 0,
    $$

    and then define
    $$
    x' = \sum_{k=1}^\infty b_k 3^{-k} \quad\text{where } b_1 = 0, b_{k>1} = 2.
    $$

    The claim now is that $x=x'$, which follows from the fact that this is a geometric sum that can be written in closed form:
    \begin{align*}
      x' &= \sum_{k=2}^\infty (2) 3^{-k} \\
      & = \left( \sum_{k=0}^\infty (2)3^{-k} \right) - 2 - 2(3\inv) \\
      & = 2\left( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^{-k} \right) - 2 - 2(3\inv) \\
      &= 2 (\frac 1 {1 - \frac 1 3}) - 2 - 2(3\inv) \\
      &= 2 \left(\frac 3 2\right) - 2 - 2(3\inv) \\
      &= 1 - \frac 2 3 \\
      &= \frac 1 3 = x.
    \end{align*}

    In short, we have $\frac 1 3 = (0.1)_3 = (0.222\cdots)_3$ as ternary expansions, and a similar proof shows that such an expansion without 1s can be found for any endpoint.

    For the inductive step, consider $a_n$: the claim is that if $a_n = 1$, then $x \not \in C_{n+1}$ -- that is, it is contained in one of the intervals deleted at the $n+1$st stage. Writing the deleted interval at this stage as $(a,b)$, we find that $a_n = 1$ if and only if $x \in [a, b)$. Since $x\in C$, the only way $a_n$ can be 1 is if $x$ was in fact the endpoint $a$ (since no previous digit was a 1, by hypothesis). However, as shown above, every such endpoint has a ternary expansion containing no 1s. $\qed$

    \vspace{1em}\hrule

    Therefore, if we can produce an $x$ that satisfies $x \neq \frac{k}{3^n}$ for any $k, n$ \textbf{and} $x$ has no 1s in its ternary expansion, we will have an $x\in C$ that is not an endpoint.

    So take
    $$
    x = (0.\overline{02})_3 = (0.020202\cdots)_3.
    $$

    This evidently has no 1s in its ternary expansion, and if we sum the corresponding geometric series, we find $x = \frac 1 4$. This is not of the form $\frac k {3^n}$ for any $k, n$, and thus fulfills both conditions.

  \item We first show that $C$ is nowhere dense by showing that the interior of its closure is empty, i.e. $(\overline C)^\circ = \emptyset$.

    To do so, we note that $C$ is itself closed and so $C = \overline C$. To see why this is, consider $C^c$; we'll show that it is open. By construction, $C_1^c$ is the open interval $(\frac 1 3, \frac 2 3)$ that is deleted, and similarly $C_n^c$ is the finite union of the open intervals that are deleted at the $n$th stage. But then
    $$
    C^c = \left(\intersect C_n \right)^c = \union C_n^c
    $$
    is an infinite union of open sets, which is also open. So $C$ is closed.

    It is also the case that $C$ has empty interior, so $C^\circ = \emptyset$. Towards a contradiction, suppose $x\in C$ is an interior point; then there is some neighborhood $N_\varepsilon(x) \subset C$. Since we are on the real line, we can write this as an interval $(x-\varepsilon, x+\varepsilon)$, which has length $2\varepsilon > 0$. Moreover, we have the containment
    $$
    (x-\varepsilon, x+ \varepsilon) \subset C \subset C_n
    $$
    for every $n$.

    Claim: The length of $C_n$ is $(\frac 2 3)^n$ where we define $C_0 = [0, 1]$. Letting $L_n$ be the length of $C_n$, one easy way to see that this is the case is to note that $L_n$ satisfies the recurrence relation
    $$
    L_{n+1} = \frac2 3 L_n,
    $$
    since an interval of length $\frac 1 3 L_n$ is removed at each stage. With the initial conditions $L_0 = 1$, it can be checked that $L_n = \left( \frac 2 3 \right)^n$ solves this relation.

    Now, since $x\in C = \intersect C_n$, it is in every $C_n$. So we can choose $n$ large enough such that
    $$
    \left( \frac 2 3 \right)^n \leq 2\varepsilon.
    $$

    Letting $\mu(X)$ denote the length of an interval, we always have $C \subseteq C_n$ and so $\mu(C) \leq \mu(C_n)$.

    Using the subadditivity of measures, we now have
    \begin{align*}
    (x-\varepsilon, x+ \varepsilon) \subset C \subset C_n \\
    \implies \mu(x-\varepsilon, x+ \varepsilon) \leq \mu(C) \leq \mu(C_n) \\
    \implies 2\varepsilon \leq \left( \frac 2 3 \right)^n,
    \end{align*}

    a contradiction. So $C$ has no interior points.

    But this means that
    $$
    (\overline C)^\circ = C^\circ = \emptyset,
    $$
    and so $C$ is nowhere dense.

    To see that $\mu(C) = 0$, we can use the fact that for any sets, measures are additive over disjoint sets and we have
    $$
    \mu(A) + \mu(X \setminus A) = \mu(X) \implies \mu(X \setminus A) = \mu(X) - \mu(A).
    $$

    Here we will take $X = [0,1]$, so $\mu(X) = 1$, and $A = C$ the Cantor set.

    By tracing through the construction of the Cantor set, letting $B_n$ be the length of the interval that is removed at each stage, we can deduce
    \begin{align*}
      B_1 &= \frac 1 3 \\
      B_2 &= \frac 2 9 \\
      \cdots \\
      B_n &= \frac {2^n}{3^{n+1}}
    .\end{align*}

    We can identify $B_n = \mu(C_n^c)$, and using the fact that $C_n^c \intersect C_{>n}^c = \emptyset$ and the fact that measures are additive over disjoint sets, we can compute

    \[
    \begin{align*}
      \mu(C) &= 1 - \mu(C^c) \\
             &= 1 - \mu((\intersect_{n=0}^\infty C_n)^c) \\
             &= 1 - \mu(\disjoint_{n=0}^\infty C_n^c) \\
             &= 1 - \sum_{n=0}^\infty \mu(C_n^c) \\
             &= 1 - \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2^n}{3^{-n}} \\
             &= 1 - \frac 1 3 \sum_{n=0} \left( \frac 2 3 \right)^n \\
             &= 1 - \frac 1 3 \left( \frac 1 {1-\frac 2 3} \right) \\
             &= 1 - \frac 1 3 (3)  = 0,
    \end{align*}
    \]

    which is what we wanted to show. $\qed$

  \item Let $y\in [0,1]$ be arbitrary, we will construct an element $x\in C$ such that $y = f(x)$. We first note that every number has a binary expansion, and we can write
    $$
    y = \sum_{k=1}^\infty y_k 2^{-k} \quad\text{where } y_k \in \theset{0, 1}.
    $$

    Now we construct
    $$
    x = \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k 3^{-k}\quad\text{where } a_k = 2y_k \implies a_k \in \theset{0, 2}.
    $$

    By the characterization given in part (1), we see that $x\in C$ because it has no 1s in its ternary expansion. Moreover, under $f$, we have $a_k \mapsto \frac 1 2 a_k = \frac 1 2 (2 a_k) = a_k$, and so $f(x) = y$ by construction.

    This shows that $C$ surjects onto $[0,1]$, and in particular, $\# C \geq \#[0, 1]$ holds for the cardinalities of these sets. Since $[0,1]$ is uncountable (say, by Cantor's diagonalization argument), this shows that $C$ is uncountable.
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}\hfill
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $X$ is $G_\delta$ iff $X^c$ is $F_\sigma$.
    \item Show that $X$ closed $\implies X$ is $G_\delta$ and $X$ open $\implies X$ is $F_\sigma$.
    \item Give an example of an $F_\sigma$ set that is not $G_\delta$, and a set that is neither.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}


\begin{solution}\hfill
\begin{enumerate}
  \item To show the forward direction, suppose $X$ is a $F_\sigma$, so $X = \union_{i\in\NN} A_i$ with each $A_i$ an closed set. By definition, each $A_i^c$ is open, and we have
    $$
    X^c = \left( \union_{i\in \NN}A_i \right)^c = \intersect_{i\in\NN} A_i^c,
    $$
    which exhibits $X^c$ as a countable intersection of closed sets, making it an $G_\delta$.

    The reverse direction proceeds analogously: supposing $X^c$ is $G_\delta$, we can write $X^c = \intersect_{i\in\NN} B_i$ with each $B_i$ open, where $B_i^c$ is closed by definition, and
    $$
    X = (X^c)^c = (\intersect B_i)^c = \union B_i^c
    $$
    which exhibits $X$ as a union of closed sets, and thus an $F_\sigma$.

  \item Suppose $X$ is closed, we want to then write $X$ as a countable intersection of open sets.
    For every $x\in X$ and every $n\in \NN$, define
\[
  \begin{align*}
    B_n(x) &= \theset{y\in \RR^n \suchthat \abs{x - y} \leq \frac 1 n}, \\
    V_n &= \union_{x\in X} B_n(x), \\
    W &= \intersect_{n \in \NN} V_n
  .\end{align*}
\]

  Explicitly, we have
  $$W = \intersect_{n\in \NN} \union_{x\in X} B_n(x),
  $$
  and the claim is that $W$ is a $G_\delta$ and $W = X$.

  To see that the $V_n$ are open, note that $n$ is fixed and each $B_n(x)$ is an open ball around a point $x$. Any union of open sets is open, and thus so is $V_n$. By construction, $W$ is then a countable intersection of open sets, and thus $W$ is a $G_\delta$ by definition.

  We show $W=X$ in two parts. To see that $X \subseteq W$, note that if $x\in X$, then $x \in B_n(x)$ for every $n$ and thus $x \in V_n$ for every $n$ as well. But this means that $x \in \intersect_n V_n$, and so $x\in W$.

  To see that $W \subseteq X$, let $w\in W$ be arbitrary. If $w\in X$, there is nothing to check, so suppose $w\not\in X$ towards a contradiction.

  Since $w \in \intersect_n V_n$, it is in $V_n$ for every $n$. But this means that there is some particular $x_0$ such that $w \in B_n(x_0)$ for every $n$ as well, and moreover since we assumed $w\not\in X$, we have $w\neq x_0$.

  Then, letting $N_\varepsilon(w)$ be an arbitrary neighborhood of $w$, we can find an $n$ large enough such that $B_n(x) \subset N_\varepsilon(w)$. This means that $x_0 \neq w$ can be found in every neighborhood of $w$, which makes $w$ a limit point of $X$. However, since we assumed $X$ was closed, it contains all of its limit points, which would force $w \in X$, a contradiction. $\qed$

  \vspace{1em}\hrule

  Now suppose $X$ is an open set, we want to show it is an $F_\sigma$ and can thus be written as a countable union of closed sets. We can use the fact that $X^c$ is closed, and by the previous result, $X^c$ is thus a $G_\delta$. But by an earlier result, $X^c$ is a $G_\delta \iff (X^c)^c = X$ is an $F_\sigma$, and we are done.

  \item We want to construct a set that can be written as a countable union of closed sets, but not as a countable intersection of open sets. Note that in $\RR$ with the usual topology, singletons are closed, and so $\theset{p}^c$ is an open set for any point $p$.

  With this motivation, consider $X = \QQ$ and $X^c = \RR \setminus \QQ$. We can write
  $$
  \QQ = \union_{q \in \QQ} \theset{q},
  $$

  which exhibits $X$ as a countable union of closed sets because $\QQ$ itself is countable. So $\QQ$ is an $F_\sigma$ set. Suppose towards a contradiction that $\QQ$ is also $G_\delta$, so we have $\QQ = \intersect_{i\in\NN}O_i$ with each $O_i$ open. So each $O_{i}$ covers $\QQ$, i.e. $\QQ \subseteq O_{i}$, which (importantly!) forces each $O_i$ to be dense in $\RR$.

  But now note that we can also write
  $$
  \RR \setminus \QQ = \RR \setminus \union_{q\in \QQ} \theset{q} = \intersect_{q\in\QQ} \RR\setminus \theset{q},
  $$

  where we can note that $\RR\setminus\theset{q}$ is an open, dense subset of $\RR$ for each $q$. We can appeal to the Baire category theorem twice, which tells us that any countable intersection of dense sets will also be dense. This first tells us that the above intersection, and thus $\RR\setminus\QQ$, is dense in $\RR$. Then, writing
  $$
  \left(\intersect_{i\in \NN} O_i\right) \intersect \left(\intersect_{q\in\QQ} \RR\setminus\theset{q}\right) = \QQ \intersect \RR\setminus\QQ = \emptyset,
  $$
  we produce what is still just a countable intersection of dense sets, and by Baire, the result would need to be dense as well. The empty set is clearly not dense in $\RR$, so we arrive at a contradiction.

\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

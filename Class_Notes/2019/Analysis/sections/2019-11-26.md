Question:
Let $f\in L^1([a, b])$ and $F(x) = \int_a^x f(y) ~dy$ -- is $F$ differentiable a.e. and $F' = f$?

If $f$ is continuous, then absolutely yes.

Otherwise, we are considering 
$$
\frac{f(x+h) - F(x)}{h} = \frac{1}{h} \int_x^{x+h} f(y)~dy \to_? f(x)
$$

so the more general question is
$$
\lim_{m(I) \to 0, x\in I} \frac{1}{m(I)} \int_I f(y) ~dy =_? f(x) ~a.e.
$$

Note that if $f$ is continuous, since $[a, b]$ is compact, we have uniform continuity and $\frac{1}{m(I)} \int_I (f(y) - f(x)) ~dy < \frac{1}{m(I)} \int_I \varepsilon$.

## Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem

**Theorem:**
If $f\in L^1(\RR^n)$ then
$$
\lim_{m(B) \to 0, x\in B} \int \frac{1}{m(B)} \int_B f(y)~dy = f(x)~a.e.
$$
> Note: although it's not obvious at first glance, this really is a theorem about differentiation.

**Corollary (Lebesgue Density Theorem):**
For any measurable set $E \subseteq \RR^n$, we have
$$
\lim_{r\to 0} \frac{m(E\intersect B_r(x))}{m(B_r(x))} = 1 ~a.e.
$$
*Proof:*
Let $f = \chi_E$ in the theorem.

Proof of theorem:
We want to show 
$$
Df(x) \definedas \limsup_{m(B) \to 0, x\in B} \abs{\frac{1}{m(B)} \int_B (f(y) - f(x))~dy  } \to 0
$$

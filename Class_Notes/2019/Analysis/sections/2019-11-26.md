Question:
Let $f\in L^1([0, 1])$ and $F(x) = \int_a^x f(y) ~dy$ -- is $F$ differentiable a.e. and $F' = f$?

If $f$ is continuous, then absolutely yes.

Otherwise, we are considering 
$$
\frac{f(x+h) - F(x)}{h} = \frac{1}{h} \int_x^{x+h} f(y)~dy \to_? f(x)
$$

so the more general question is
$$
\lim_{m(I) \to 0, x\in I} \frac{1}{m(I)} \int_I f(y) ~dy =_? f(x) ~a.e.
$$

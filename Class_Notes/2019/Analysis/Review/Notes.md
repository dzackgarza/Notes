**Definition:**
A set $S$ is **nowhere dense** iff the closure of $S$ has empty interior.

**Definition:**
A set is **meager** if it is a *countable* union of nowhere dense sets.

> Note that a *finite* union of nowhere dense is still nowhere dense.

**Lemma:**
The Cantor set is closed with empty interior.

> Proof: Its complement is a union of open intervals, and can't contain an interval since intervals have positive measure and $m(C_n)$ tends to zero.

> **Corollary:**
> The Cantor set is nowhere dense.

**Definition:**
An $F_\sigma$ set is a union of closed sets, and a $G_\delta$ set is an intersection of opens.

> Mnemonic: "F" stands for *ferme*, which is "closed" in French, and $\sigma$ corresponds to a "sum", i.e. a union.

**Lemma:**
Singleton sets in $\RR$ are closed.

**Corollary:**
$\QQ$ is an $F_\sigma$ set.

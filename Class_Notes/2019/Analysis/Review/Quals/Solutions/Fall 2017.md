Note that $f(x) = e^x$ is entire and thus equal to its power series.
So $f(x) = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac 1 {j!}x^j$.

Letting $f_N(x) = \sum_{j=1}^N \frac 1 {j!} x^j$, we have $f_N(x) \to f(x)$ pointwise on $(-\infty ,\infty)$.

For any compact interval $[-M, M]$, we have

\begin{align*}
\norm{f_N(x) - f(x)}_\infty
&= \sup_{-M\leq x \leq M} ~\abs{\sum_{j=N+1}^\infty \frac 1 {j!} x^j} \\
&\leq \sup_{-M\leq x \leq M} ~ \sum_{j=N+1}^\infty \frac 1 {j!} \abs{x}^j \\
&\leq \sum_{j=N+1}^\infty \frac 1 {j!} M^j \\
&\leq \sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac 1 {j!} M^j \\
&= e^M \\
&<\infty
,\end{align*}

so $f_N \to f$ uniformly on $[-M, M]$ by the M-test.
Thus it converges on any bounded interval.

It does not converge on $\RR$, since $x^N$ is unbounded.

$\implies$:

Suppose first that $E$ is bounded, so $x\in E \implies \abs{x} \leq M$.

Let $\theset{Q_j} \rightrightarrows E$ be a covering by closed intervals, and then note that $\theset{f(Q_j)} \rightrightarrows f(E)$.

Since $m^*(E) = 0$, we can make the intervals in this covering as small as we'd like.

If $Q_j = [a_j, b_j]$, then $\abs{Q_j} = \abs{b_i - a_i}$ and $f(Q_j) = Q_j^2 = [a_j^2, b_j^2]$ and thus 
$$
\abs{Q_j^2} = \abs{b_j^2 - a_j^2} = \abs{b_j - a_j}\abs{b_j+ a_j} = \abs{Q_j} \abs{b_j+ a_j} \leq \abs{Q_j}\cdot 2M,
$$

so choose cubes such that 
\begin{align*}
\abs{Q_j} 
&\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2M \cdot 2^j} \\
\implies m^*(E^2) 
&\leq \sum_j \abs{Q_j^2} \\ 
&\leq \sum_j \abs{Q_j} \cdot 2M  \\
&\leq \sum_j \frac{2M \varepsilon}{2M\cdot 2^j}  \\
&= \varepsilon \to 0
,\end{align*}

so $m_*(E^2) = 0$.

$\impliedby$:

Let $F = f(E)$, then just note that $F =

**Lemma:** 
$f, f\inv$ are Lipschitz on any compact interval
 
*Proof:*
Let $g = f$ or $f\inv$. 
Then $g\in C^1([0, M])$ for any $M$, so $g$ is differentiable and $g'$ is continuous.
Since $g'$ is continuous on a compact interval, it is bounded, so $\abs{g'(x)} \leq L$ for all $x$.
Applying the MVT,
\begin{align*}
\abs{f(x) - f(y)} = f'(c) \abs{x-y} \leq L \abs{x-y}
.\end{align*}
  
**Lemma:** 
If $g$ is Lipschitz, then $m(E) = 0 \iff m(g(E)) = 0$.

*Proof:*
If $g$ is Lipschitz on $\RR^n$, then $g(B_r(x)) \subseteq B_{Lr}(x)$, which is a dilated ball, and so $m^*(B_{Lr}(x)) = L^n m^*(B_{r}(x))$.

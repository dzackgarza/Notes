Note that $f(x) = e^x$ is entire and thus equal to its power series.
So $f(x) = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac 1 {j!}x^j$.

Letting $f_N(x) = \sum_{j=1}^N \frac 1 {j!} x^j$, we have $f_N(x) \to f(x)$ pointwise on $(-\infty ,\infty)$.

For any compact interval $[-M, M]$, we have

\begin{align*}
\norm{f_N(x) - f(x)}_\infty
&= \sup_{-M\leq x \leq M} ~\abs{\sum_{j=N+1}^\infty \frac 1 {j!} x^j} \\
&\leq \sup_{-M\leq x \leq M} ~ \sum_{j=N+1}^\infty \frac 1 {j!} \abs{x}^j \\
&\leq \sum_{j=N+1}^\infty \frac 1 {j!} M^j \\
&\leq \sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac 1 {j!} M^j \\
&= e^M \\
&<\infty
,\end{align*}

so $f_N \to f$ uniformly on $[-M, M]$ by the M-test.
Thus it converges on any bounded interval.

It does not converge on $\RR$, since $x^N$ is unbounded.

It suffices to consider the bounded case, i.e. $E \subseteq B_M(0)$ for some $M$.
Then write $E_n = B_n(0) \intersect E$ and apply the theorem to $E_n$

**Lemma:** 
$f(x) = x^2, f\inv(x) = \sqrt{x}$ are Lipschitz on any compact subset of $[0, \infty)$.
 
*Proof:*
Let $g = f$ or $f\inv$. 
Then $g\in C^1([0, M])$ for any $M$, so $g$ is differentiable and $g'$ is continuous.
Since $g'$ is continuous on a compact interval, it is bounded, so $\abs{g'(x)} \leq L$ for all $x$.
Applying the MVT,
\begin{align*}
\abs{f(x) - f(y)} = f'(c) \abs{x-y} \leq L \abs{x-y}
.\end{align*}
  
**Lemma:** 
If $g$ is Lipschitz on $\RR^n$, then $m(E) = 0 \implies m(g(E)) = 0$.

*Proof:*
If $g$ is Lipschitz, then 
$$
g(B_r(x)) \subseteq B_{Lr}(x)
,$$ 
which is a dilated ball/cube, and so 
$$
m^*(B_{Lr}(x)) \leq L^n \cdot m^*(B_{r}(x))
.$$

Now choose $\theset{Q_j} \rightrightarrows E$; then $\theset{g(Q_j)} \rightrightarrows g(E)$.

By the above observation,
\begin{align*}
\abs{g(Q_j)} \leq L^n \abs{Q_j}
,\end{align*}

and so 
\begin{align*}
m^*(g(E)) \leq \sum_j \abs{g(Q_j)} \leq \sum_j L^n \abs{Q_j} = L^n \sum_j \abs{Q_j} \to 0 
.\end{align*}

Now just take $g(x) = x^2$ for one direction, and $g(x) = f\inv(x) = \sqrt{x}$ for the other.
$\qed$

> Lemma: $E$ is measurable iff $E = K \disjoint N$ for some $K$ compact, $N$ null.

Write $E = K \disjoint N$ where $K$ is compact and $N$ is null.

Then $\phi\inv(E) = \phi\inv(K \disjoint N) = \phi\inv(K) \disjoint \phi\inv(N)$.

Since $\phi\inv(N)$ is null by part (a) and $\phi\inv(K)$ is the preimage of a compact set under a continuous map and thus compact, $\phi\inv(E) = K' \disjoint N'$ where $K'$ is compact and $N'$ is null, so $\phi\inv(E)$ is measurable.

So $\phi$ is a measurable function, so gives a well-define map $\mathcal L(\RR) \to \mathcal L(\RR)$.
Restricting to $[0, \infty)$, $f$ is bijection, and thus so is $\phi$.

$\qed$

Possible first day question: how can we "measure" a subset of $\RR$? We'd like bigger sets to have a higher measure, we wouldn't want removing points to increase the measure, etc. This is not quite possible, at least something that works on *all* subsets of $\RR$. We'll come back to this in a few lectures.

__Notions of "smallness" in $\RR$__

Definition: Let $E$ be a set, then $E$ is *countable* if it is in a one-to-one correspondence with $E' \subseteq \NN$, which includes $\emptyset, \NN$.

Definition: $E$ is *meager* (or of *1st category*) if it can be written as a countable union of **nowhere dense** sets.

Intuitively, a set is *nowhere dense* if it is full of holes. Recall that a $X \subseteq Y$ is dense in $Y$ iff the closure of $X$ is all of $Y$. So we'll make the following definition.

Definition: A set $A \subseteq \RR$ is *nowhere dense* if every interval $I$ contains a subinterval $S \subseteq I$ such that $S \subseteq A^c$.

Note that a finite union of nowhere dense sets is also nowhere dense, which is why we're giving a name to such a countable union above. Example: $\QQ$ is an infinite, countable union of nowhere dense sets that is not itself nowhere dense.

Equivalently,
- $A^c$ contains a dense, open set.
- The interior of the closure is empty.

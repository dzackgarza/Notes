Possible first day question: how can we "measure" a subset of $\RR$? We'd like bigger sets to have a higher measure, we wouldn't want removing points to increase the measure, etc. This is not quite possible, at least something that works on *all* subsets of $\RR$. We'll come back to this in a few lectures.

Possible first day question: how can we "measure" a subset of $\RR$? We'd like bigger sets to have a higher measure, we wouldn't want removing points to increase the measure, etc. This is not quite possible, at least something that works on *all* subsets of $\RR$. We'll come back to this in a few lectures.

__Notions of "smallness" in $\RR$__

Definition: Let $E$ be a set, then $E$ is *countable* if it is in a one-to-one correspondence with $E' \subseteq \NN$, which includes $\emptyset, \NN$.

Definition: $E$ is *meager* (or of *1st category*) if it can be written as a countable union of **nowhere dense** sets.

You can show that any finite subset of $\RR$ is meager.

Intuitively, a set is *nowhere dense* if it is full of holes. Recall that a $X \subseteq Y$ is dense in $Y$ iff the closure of $X$ is all of $Y$. So we'll make the following definition.

Definition: A set $A \subseteq \RR$ is *nowhere dense* if every interval $I$ contains a subinterval $S \subseteq I$ such that $S \subseteq A^c$.

Note that a finite union of nowhere dense sets is also nowhere dense, which is why we're giving a name to such a countable union above. Example: $\QQ$ is an infinite, countable union of nowhere dense sets that is not itself nowhere dense.

Equivalently,
- $A^c$ contains a dense, open set.
- The interior of the closure is empty.

We'd like to say something is measure zero exactly when it can be covered by intervals whose lengths sum to less than $\varepsilon$.

Definition: $E$ is a *null set* (or has *measure zero*) if $\forall \varepsilon >0$, there exists a sequence of intervals $\theset{I_j}_{j=1}^\infty$ such that
$$
E \subseteq \union_{j=1}^\infty~\text{ and } ~ \sum \abs{I_j} < \varepsilon.
$$
Exercise: show that a countable union of null sets is null.

We have several relationships

- Countable $\implies$ Meager, but not the converse.
- Countable $\implies$ Null, but not the converse.

Exercise: Show that the "middle third" Cantor set is not countable, but is both null and meager. Key point: the Cantor set does not contain any intervals.

Theorem: Every $E \subseteq \RR$ can be written as $E = A \disjoint B$ where $A$ is null and $B$ is meager.

> This gives some information about how nullity and meagerness interact -- in particular, $\RR$ itself is neither meager nor null. Idea: if meager $\implies$ null, this theorem allows you to write $\RR$ as the union of two null sets. This is bad!

Proof: We can assume $E = \RR$. Take an enumeration of the rationals, so $\QQ = \theset{q_j}_{j=1}^\infty$. Around each $q_j$, put an interval around it of size $1/2^{j+k}$ where we'll allow $k$ to vary, yielding multiple intervals around $q_j$. To do this, define $I_{j, k} = (q_j - 1/2^{j+k}, q_j + 2^{j+k})$. Now let $G_k = \union_j I_{j, k}$. Finally, let $A = \intersect_k G_k$; we claim that $A$ is null.

Note that $\sum \abs{I_{j, k} = \frac{1} {2^k} }$

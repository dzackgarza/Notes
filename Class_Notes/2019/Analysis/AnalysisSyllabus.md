# Function Spaces

- The Banach spaces $L^1$ and $L^\infty$:

- Completeness

- Convolutions 
  - Approximations to the identity

- Linear functionals and 
  - $L^\infty$ as the dual of $L^1$

# Hilbert space and $L^2$ spaces:

- Schwarz inequality 
  - Orthogonality

- Linear functionals 
-   The Riesz representation theorem

- Bessel's inequality
  - Orthonormal bases 
  - Parseval's identity

- Trigonometric series: 
  - Trigonometric polynomials are dense in $( C([0, 1]), \norm{\wait}_\infty)$ 
  - Trigonometric polynomials are dense in $( L^2([0, 1]), \norm{\wait}_2 )$

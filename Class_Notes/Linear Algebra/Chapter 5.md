# Chapter 5: Orthogonality

The point of this chapter is to show how an inner product can induce a notion of "angle", which agrees with our intuition in Euclidean spaces such as $\RR^n$, but can be extended to much less intuitive things, like spaces of functions.

Given an inner product 
$$
\inner{\wait}{\wait}: \RR^n \cross \RR^n \to \RR,
$$

we can define a **norm**
$$
\norm {\vector x} = \sqrt{\inner{\vector x}{\vector x}}
$$

We can also use

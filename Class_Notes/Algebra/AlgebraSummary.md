# Groups

## Definitions

### **Subgroup Generated** by a set $A$

  - $<A> = \{a_1^{\pm 1},a_2^{\pm 1}, \cdots a_2^{\pm 1} : a_i \in A, n \in \mathbb{N}\}$
  - Equivalently, the intersection of all $H$ such that $A \subseteq H \leq G$

### **Free Group** on a set $X$

  - Equivalently, words over the alphabet $X$ made into a group via concatenation

### **Centralizer** of an element or a subgroup

  - $C_G(a) = \{ g\in G : ga = ag \}$
  - $$C_G(H) = \{ g\in G : \forall h\in H, gh = hg \} = \bigcap_{h\in H} C_G(h)$$
    - Note - requires the same $g$ on both sides!
  - Facts:
    - $C_G(H) \leq G$
    - $C_G(H) \unlhd N_G(H)$
    - $C_G(G) = Z(G)$
    - $C_H(a) = H \intersect C_G(a)$

### **Center** of a group

  - $Z(G) = \{ g\in G : \forall x \in G, gx = xg\}$
  - Facts
    - $$Z(G) = \bigcap_{a\in G} C_G(a)$$

### **Normalizer** of a subgroup

  - $$N_G(H) = \{ g\in G : gHg^{-1} = H \}$$

  - Equivalently, $\bigcup \{ K: H\unlhd K \leq G \}$ (the largest $K \leq G$ for which $H \unlhd K$)
  - Equivalently, the stabilizer of $H$ under $G$ acting on its subgroups via conjugation
  - Differs from centralizer; can have $gh = h'g$
  - Facts:
    - $C_G(H) \subseteq N_G(H) \leq G$
    - $N_G(H) / C_G(H) \cong A \leq Aut(H)$
    - Given $H\subseteq G$, let $$S(H)= \bigcup_{g\in G} gHg^{-1}$$, so $|S(H)|$ is the number of conjugates to $H$. Then $$|S(H)| = [G : N_G(H)]$$
      - i.e. the number of subgroups conjugate to $H$ equals the index of the normalizer of $H$.

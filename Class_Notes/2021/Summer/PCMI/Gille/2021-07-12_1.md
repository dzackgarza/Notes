title: "Philippe GILLE, Torsors over Affine Curves"
---

# Monday, July 12

Abstract: 

> We shall present the theory of G-torsors (or G-bundles) in algebraic geometry which includes for example vector bundles and quadratic bundles (Grothendieck-Serre, 1958). We focus on the case of an affine smooth connected curve firstly over an algebraically closed field k; we shall show that G-torsors are trivial for a semisimple k-group G. Secondly we will consider the case of a perfect field and discuss the important case of the affine line (Raghunathan-Ramanathan, 1984). This will be an opportunity to deal with étale cohomology and patching techniques.

## Serre-Swan and Vector Group Schemes

:::{.remark}
We'll be looking at ways to go from the world of differential geometry to algebraic geometry.
Notably, in differential geometry we have notions of 

- Vector bundles
- Principal $G\dash$bundles
- Principal homogeneous spaces

Serre-Grothendieck gave algebro-geometric analogs of these in 1958, extending these notions to the setting of $G\dash$bundles over a scheme using the étale topology.
Today we'll work over rings, or equivalently affine schemes, since most questions will be local.
We'll in fact restrict to smooth affine curves over a field.
:::

:::{.remark}
Recall the Serre-Swan correspondence between projective finite modules of finite rank and smooth vector bundles: for $X$ paracompact, there is an equivalence of categories induced by taking global sections:
\[
\underset{\GL_n(\RR)}{ \smooth\Bun_{/X}} &\mapstofrom \modsleft{C^\infty(X; \RR)}^{\fg, \proj} \\
(\mce\to X) &\mapsto \Gamma(X; \mce)
.\]
We'll upgrade this to a statement about affine schemes.
:::

:::{.definition title="Vector Group Scheme"}
Let $R \in \CRing$ be unital and $M\in \rmod$.
Let $V(M)$ denote the affine $R\dash$scheme $V(M) \da \spec \qty{\Sym^\bullet M}$, which represents 
\[
S\mapsto \Hom_{\mods{S}}(M\tensor_R S, S)
.\]
We call $V(M)$ the **vector group scheme** of $M$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Note that $V(\wait)$ commutes with arbitrary base change of rings.
:::

:::{.proposition title="Serre-Swan for Vector Group Schemes"}
$V$ as a functor induces an antiequivalence of categories between $\mods{R}$ and vector group schemes:
\[
\mods{R} &\mapstofrom \Vect\Grp\Sch\liesover{R} \\
M &\mapsto V(M) \\
\Theta(R) &\mapsfrom R
.\]

:::

:::{.remark}
If $M$ is locally free of finite rank, we can consider its dual $M\dual$.
Then $\Sym^\bullet M$ is finitely presented, and $S\to M\tensor_R S$ is represented by $W(M) \da V(M\dual)$.
Note that finite locally free is a necessary condition.

## Vector Bundles over Affine Schemes

:::{.definition title="Vector bundle over an affine scheme"}
A **vector bundle of rank $r$ over the affine scheme $\spec R$** is an $X\in \Sch\liesover{R}$ with a partition $1 = \sum_i f_i$ along with isomorphisms 
\[
\phi_i: V\qty{\qty{R\localize{f_i}}^r} \to X\fiberproduct{R} R\localize{f_i}
\]
where the transitions 
\[
\phi_i \phi_j\inv: V\qty{\qty{R\localize{(f_i, f_j)}}^r} \selfmap
\]
are linear automorphisms.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Swan-Serre"}
$M\to V(M)$ induces an equivalence between the groupoid of locally free \(R\dash\)modules of rank $r$ and the groupoid of vector bundles over $\spec R$ of rank $r$.
\[
\Grpd \ni \hspace{4em}
\rmod^{\loc\Free, r} &\quad{\mapstofrom}\quad \underset{\spec R}{\Bun^r} 
\hspace{4em}\in \Grpd
.\]

:::

:::{.example title="Tangent Bundles"}
Given 
a smooth[^smooth_fiber_def]
map of affine schemes
\[
(X\to Y) \da (\spec S\to \spec R)
&&
r\da \reldim_{X/Y} \geq 1
,\]
take the tangent bundle, which is dimension $r$:
\[
T_{X/Y} = V(\Omega_{S/R}^1) \in \underset{\spec R}\Bun
.\]

[^smooth_fiber_def]: 
Since we're in the flat and locally finitely presented case, it's sufficient that all fibers are smooth

:::

:::{.example title="Tangent bundle of the real sphere"}
Consider the real sphere
\[
Z \da \spec \RR[x,y,z] / \gens{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
.\]
Its tangent bundle $T_{Z/\RR}$ is a nontrivial dimension 2 vector bundle, which is classical but can be proven algebraically.
As a consequence, $Z$ can not be equipped with the structure of a nontrivial algebraic group over $\RR$.
:::

## Linear Groups

:::{.remark}
For $M \in \rmod^{\loc\Free, r<\infty}$, consider
\[
\Endo_{\rmod}(M) \mapsvia{\sim}  M\dual \tensor_R M \in \Alg\liesover{R} \intersect \rmod^{\loc\Free, r<\infty}
,\]
and so $V(\Endo_{\rmod}(M))$ makes sense.
Thus $V$ is a functor 
\[
V: \Assoc\Alg^{\unital} \to\Vect\Grp\Sch\liesover{R}
.\]

Consider $S\mapsto \Aut_S(M\tensor_R S)$, which is representable by 
\[
W(\Endo_{\rmod} M) \da \GL(M) = \GL_1(M)
.\]
Note that there are left and right actions
\[
W(M) \actsonl \GL(M)\actson V(M) 
.\]

If $R$ is Noetherian, then $M \in \rmod^{\loc\Free, r<\infty} \iff \GL(M)$ is representable.
Taking $M\da M^r$ recovers the usual $\GL_n(R)$ for $n\da \rank_R M$.
Note that local freeness is necessary for representability by a group scheme here.
:::

:::{.remark}
Given $M \in \rmod^{\loc\Free, r<\infty}$ there is a partition $1 = \sum f_i$ and isomorphisms to free $R\dash$modules
\[
\phi_i: R\localize{f_i}^r \to M\fiberproduct{R} R\localize{f_i}
&&
\phi_i\inv \phi_j \leadsto
g_{ij} \in \GL_r\qty{R\localize{(f_i, f_j)}}
.\]
These $g_{ij}$ in fact satisfying a cocycle condition:
\[
g_{ij} g_{jk} = g_{ik} \in \GL_r(R\localize{f_i f_j f_k})
.\]
:::

:::{.definition title="Cech Nonabelian Cohomology"}
Take an affine cover 
\[
\mcu \da \ts{\spec R\localize{f_i}}_{i\in I}\covers \spec R
\]
and define $H^1(\mcu/R; \GL_r)$ to be 1-cocycles up to some notion of cohomological equivalence.
This attaches a vector bundle $V(M)$ of rank $r$ a class $\gamma(M) \in H^1(\mcu/R; \GL_r)$.
Conversely, by Zariski gluing, for any such cocycle $g_{ij}$ we can assign some $V_g\in \VectBun^r\liesover{R}$ with a trivializations satisfying $\phi_i \phi_j\inv = g_{ij}$.

By taking a limit over all covers, we can define
\[
\cechH^1_\zar(R; \GL_r) \da \displaystyle\colim_{\mcu} H^1(\mcu/R; \GL_r)
,\] 
the Čech nonabelian cohomology of $\GL_r$ with respect to the Zariski topology on $\spec R$.
:::

:::{.remark}
This classifies $[V] \in \Bun\liesover{R}^{\cong, r}$ which are trivialized by $\mcu$. 
So there are induced maps
\[
f: \GL_r \to \GL_s \quad\leadsto\quad f_*: V_r\in \Bun^r\liesover{R} \to V_s \in \Bun^s\liesover{R}
\]
which extend to functors
\[
f_*: \Bun\liesover{R}^r \to \Bun\liesover{R}^s
.\]
:::

:::{.slogan}
Nice constructions for vector bundles arise from morphisms of group schemes.

## Classification of Modules over a Dedekind Ring

:::{.example title="Direct sums"}
Write $n= \sum n_i$ to get a block map
\[
f: \prod_{i} \GL_{n_i} &\to \GL_n \\
(A_1, \cdots, A_\ell) &\mapsto A_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus A_\ell
.\]
In general, the diagonal map obtained by setting $n_i=1$ for all $i$ yields $\GG_m^r \to \GL_r$ a decomposable vector bundle, i.e. a direct sum of rank 1 bundles.
:::

:::{.example title="Tensor products"}
Write $n= \prod r_i$ to get a similar map
\[
f: \prod_{i} \GL_{r_i} &\to \GL_n \\
(A_1, \cdots, A_\ell) &\mapsto \underset{R}{\Tensor_{i=1}^\ell} A_i
,\]
sometimes called the *Kronecker product*.
:::

:::{.example title="Determinant"}
We set $\det(V) \da \det_*(V) \da \Extalg^r V$, the determinant bundle.

:::

:::{.remark}
The next result is a classical theorem in commutative algebra, and the goal is to give a geometric proof.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Classification of modules over a Dedekind ring"}
Let $R$ be a Dedekind ring 
[^ref_dedekind_ring]
, then for any 
\[
R\in \rmod^{\loc\Free, r\geq 1} \implies R \cong R^{r-1} \oplus I && I = \det(R^{r-1} \oplus I) \in \rmod\units, 
\]
where $I$ is invertible and unique up to isomorphism.
Thus vector bundles over $R$ are decomposable and classified by their determinant.

[^ref_dedekind_ring]: 
Noetherian domain where the localizations at maximal ideals are DVRs, 

:::

:::{.corollary title="Characterization of trivial modules"}
A locally free \(R\dash\)module $M$ of rank $r\geq 1$ is trivial $\iff \det M$ is trivial.
:::

:::{.proof title="of the classification theorem"}
We're given $V(M)$ a vector bundle, which trivializes over an affine subset $\spec R\localize{f_i}$.
Set 
\[
\Sigma \da \spec R / \spec R\localize{f_i} = \ts{\mfp_i}_{i=1}^c && \mfp_i \in \mspec R
.\]
Let $\hat R\localize{\mfp_i}$ be the completion of the residue DVR and let $\hat K\localize{\mfp_i} \da K\tensor_R \hat R\localize{\mfp_i}$ its fraction field.
By Nakayama, $M\tensor_R \hat R\localize{\mfp_i}$ is free, so pick a trivialization.
We can use this to produce a double coset:
\[
c_{\Sigma}\left(R; \GL_{r}\right)
\da
\GL_{r}\left(R_{f}\right) 
\backslash 
\quad \prod_{j=1}^c \GL_{r}
\left(
\hat K\localize{\mfp_i}
\right) 
\quad / 
\GL_{r}
\left(
\hat R \localize{\mfp_i}
\right)
.\]


:::{.claim}
The following map is injective:
\[
\ker\qty{H^1(R; \GL_r) \to H^1\qty{R\localize{f}; \GL_r}} \to c_\Sigma(R; \GL_r)
,\]
although we'll only need that its kernel is trivial.

:::

We can assume $\det V(M)$ is trivial to get 
\[
g_i \in \ker \det_* \da \ker\qty{c_\Sigma(R; \GL_r) \to c_\Sigma(R; \GG_m)}
.\]
Changing trivializations, we can assume $g_i \in \SL_n(\hat K_{\mfp_i})$, which is generated by elementary matrices.
Using that $R_f \subseteq \prod_i \hat K\localize{\mfp_i}$ is dense, we get 
\[
\SL_n\qty{\hat K\localize{\mfp_i}} \subseteq \prod_i \SL_n \qty{ \hat K\localize{\mfp_i}} \text{ is dense}
.\]
But since each $\SL_n\qty{\hat R\localize{\mfp_i}}$ is clopen in $\SL_n\qty{\hat K\localize{\mfp_i}}$, we obtain $c_\Sigma(R; \SL_r) = 1$ and injectivity allows us to conclude that $V(M)$ is a trivial vector bundle.
:::

:::{.remark}
This is a "strong approximation" argument.

## Replacing the Zariski Topology



:::{.definition title="Quadratic Forms"}
Given an $M\in \rmod$, a map $q:M\to R$ is a **quadratic form** iff 

- $q(\lambda x) = \lambda^2 q(x)$ for all $\lambda\in R, x\in M$, 
- The associated form is symmetric and bilinear:
\[
b_q: M\tensor_R M &\to R \\
(x, y) &\mapsto q(x+y) - q(x) -q(y)
.\]

The form $q$ is **regular** iff $b_q$ induces an isomorphism $M \mapsvia{\sim} M\dual$.
:::


:::{.example title="The hyperbolic form"}
For $V\in \rmod^{\loc\Free, \rank < \infty}$, the **hyperbolic form** is defined by 
\[
q_\hyp: V \oplus V\dual &\to R \\
v \tensor \psi &\mapsto \psi(v)
.\]

:::



:::{.remark}
The definition of nonabelian cohomology will extend to arbitrary group schemes, but the Zariski topology is not fine enough.
One reason to try extending this theory will be quadratic bundles.
For a regular quadratic form $(M, q)$ with $M \in \rmod^{\loc\Free, \rank < \infty}$, we can draw an analogy with usual quadratic forms.
So for any $R\dash$ring $S$ we could define a subgroup scheme
\[
\Orth(q, M) \da \ts{g \in \GL(M)(S) \st q_S \circ g = q_S } \leq \GL(M)
\]
and similarly define $H^1(\mcu/R; \Orth(q, M))$ for any open cover $\mcu \covers R$.

:::


:::{.lemma title="?"}
$H^1_\zar(\mcu/R; \Orth(q, M))$ classifies isomorphism classes of regular quadratic forms $(q', M')$ which are locally isomorphic over $\mcu$ to $(q, M)$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Upshot: not all regular quadratic forms over $R$ of a fixed dimension $r$ need be locally isomorphic, noting that this already fails for $R\da \RR$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Given a morphism of group schemes $f:G\to H$, we would like control over $H^1_\zar(R; G) \to H^1_\zar(R; H)$.
Consider the Kummer map 
\[
f_d: \GG_m &\to \GG_m \\
t &\mapsto t^d
.\]
This induces $\times d$ on $\Pic(R)$, and on $\rmod\units$ corresponds to $M\to M^{\tensor d}$.
We'd like to understand its kernel and image, which will generally involve higher $H_\et$.
Given 
\[
[M] \in \ker (\Pic (R) \mapsvia{\times d} \pic (R))
,\] 
there is a trivialization $\theta: R\to M^{\tensor d}$.
We'll define a group 
\[
A_d(R) \da \ts{ (M, \theta) \st M\in \rmod\units, \theta \text{ a trivialization}}/\cong
,\]
which will correspond to something in $H_\et$.
There is an exact sequence

\begin{tikzcd}
	{R\units/(R\units)^d} && {A_d(R)} && {\Pic(R)} && {\Pic(R)} \\
	a && {[R, {\theta_a: R\to R^{\tensor d}, x\mapsto ax} ]} \\
	&& {[M, \theta]} && {[M]}
	\arrow["\phi", from=1-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["\Forget", from=1-3, to=1-5]
	\arrow["{\times d}", from=1-5, to=1-7]
	\arrow[maps to, from=2-1, to=2-3]
	\arrow[maps to, from=3-3, to=3-5]
\end{tikzcd}

:::

:::{.remark}
Grothendieck-Serre's idea is to extend the notion of covers, first with étale covers, and later with flat covers which are simpler as a first approach.
:::

:::{.definition title="Flat Covers"}
A **flat (fppf) cover** of $R$ is a finite collection $\ts{S_i}$ of $R\dash$rings where $S_i$ is a flat finitely presented $R\dash$algebra and $\spec R = \union_{i\in I} \im(\spec S_i \to \spec R)$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Setting $S\da \disjoint S_i$, this says $S$ is a faithfully flat finitely presented $R\dash$algebra.
Note that the Zariski cover is a flat cover.
:::

:::{.remark}
For $G$ an $R\dash$group scheme, a 1-cocycle for $G$ and $S/R$ is an element $g\in G(S\tensor_R S)$ where
\[
q_{12}^*(g) g_{2,3}^*(g) = q_{1, 3}^* \in G(S^{\tensor_R 3})
.\]
We can use the finite presentation hypothesis to pass to a limit over all flat covers of $\spec R$ and define $H^1_\fppf(R; G)\da \colim H^1(S/R; G)$.
:::

:::{.definition title="Torsors"}
A right $G\dash$torsor is an $R\dash$scheme with a right $G\dash$action where $X\fiberproduct{R} G \to X\fiberproduct{R} X$ where $(x, g)\mapsto (x, x\cdot g)$ is an isomorphism, and there exists a flat cover $R_i/R$ with $X(R_i)\neq 0$.
The first condition is simple transitivity, i.e. $G(T)$ acts on $X(T)$.
The second is local triviality, e.g. for the *split torsor* (a simple but important example).

:::

:::{.remark}
If $X(R) \neq \emptyset$, so $X$ has an $R\dash$point, the point $x\in X(R)$ defines a morphism $g\mapsto x\cdot g$ which is an isomorphism, and we say $X$ is trivial.
The second condition states that $R\dash$torsors under $G$ are locally trivial for the flat topology.
The category of $G\dash$torsors is a groupoid?
\todo[inline]{Missed}

:::

:::{.remark}
The $R\dash$functor of automorphisms of the trivial $G\dash$torsor $G$ is representable by $G$ acting by left translation.
Formally we'll define $H^1_\fppf(R; G)$ to be the isomorphism classes of $G\dash$torsors for the flat topology.
$H^1_\fppf(S/R; G)$ is the subset of split torsors.
There is a *class map*
\todo[inline]{Missed}

:::

:::{.remark}
Let $T$ be a faithfully flat descent of $R$, then there is an Amitsur complex
\[
0\to M\to M\tensor_R T \to M \tensor_R T^{\tensor_R 2} \to \cdots
.\]
This is exact for each $M\in \rmod$.
This allows identifying 
\[
X(R) = \ts{ x\in X(T) \ts{ \phi_1^*(x) = \phi_2^*(x) \in X(T^{\tensor_R 2}) } } 
,\]
which holds for any $R\dash$scheme.

For $N\in \mods{T}$, we consider the $T^{\tensor_R 2}\dash$Modules $\phi_1^*(N) \da T\tensor_R M$ and $\phi_2^*(N) \da M\tensor _R T$.
A **descent data** is an isomorphism $\phi: \phi_1^*(N) \mapsvia{\sim} \phi_2^*(N)$ of $T^{\tensor_R 2}\dash$modules making a triangle commute.

:::

:::{.theorem title="Grothendieck"}
The functor $M\to (M\tensor_R T, \can_M)$ is an equivalence of categories from $\rmod$ to $\mods{T}$ with descent data.
There is an explicit inverse $(N, \phi) \mapsto \ts{ n\in N \st n\tensor 1 = \phi(?) }$?
\todo[inline]{Missed}

It also induces an equivalence $\Alg\liesover{R} \to \Alg_{/k}$ with descent data.

:::

:::{.remark}
This theorem is a good reason to focus on the affine setting.
Faithfully flat descent implies the following
:::

:::{.theorem title="?"}
Let $M \in \rmod$ be locally free of rank $r$, then the $R\dash$functor $S\mapsto \Isom_{\mods{S}}(S^r, M\tensor_R S)$ is representable by a $\GL_r\dash$torsor $X^M$ over $\spec R$.
The functor $M\mapsto X^M$ is an equivalence between the groupoid of locally free $R\dash$modules and ???
\todo[inline]{Missed}

:::

:::{.corollary title="Hilbert=Grothendieck 90"}
\[
H^1_\zar(R; \GL_r) \cong H^1_\fppf(R; \GL_r)
.\]
In particular, if $R$ is local or semilocal, $H^1_\fppf(R; \GL_r) = 1$.
:::

:::{.lemma title="?"}
The class map is injective:
\[
H^1_\fppf(S/R; G)\injects \cechH^1_\fppf(S/R; G)
.\]
\todo[inline]{todo}


:::

:::{.remark}
By passing to the limit over flat covers, we get an isomorphism on $H^1_\fppf(R; G) \to \cechH^1_\fppf(R; G)$, and we can descend torsors under an affine scheme.
The proof involves a construction called **twisting**: if $Y \in \Aff\Sch\liesover{R}$ with a left $G\dash$action, then the action map 
\[
\qty{Y\fiberproduct{R} S^{\tensor_R 2}}\selfmap
\]
defines a descent datum.
If $G$ acts on itself by inner automorphism, $G_g$ is called that twisted $R\dash$group scheme, which acts on $Y_g$.
So for any $E\in \Torsor{G}$, we can define twists $\twistleft{Y}{E}$ and $\twistleft{G}{E}$.
In general, we can twist $G\dash$schemes equipped with an amply invertible $G\dash$linearized line bundle.

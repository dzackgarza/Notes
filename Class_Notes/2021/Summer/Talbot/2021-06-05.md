> Tasos Mouliunos: Perspectives on Nonabelian Hodge Theory (Talbot 2011)


For $(X, g)$ a Riemannian manifold, construct the de Rham complex \( \omega^*_X = C^\infty(X) \mapsvia{d} \Omega^1_X \mapsvia{d} \cdots \).
Using a metric we can define an adjoint operator $\delta: \Omega^* \to \Omega^*[-1]$.
Defining the Laplacian as $\laplacian \da \delta d + d\delta$, and a differential $n\dash$form is harmonic of $\laplacian \omega= 0$.
Recall that Hodge theorem: there is an isomorphism

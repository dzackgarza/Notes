> Tasos Mouliunos: Perspectives on Nonabelian Hodge Theory (Talbot 2011)


For $(X, g)$ a Riemannian manifold, construct the de Rham complex \( \omega^*_X = C^\infty(X) \mapsvia{d} \Omega^1_X \mapsvia{d} \cdots \).
Using a metric we can define an adjoint operator $\delta: \Omega^* \to \Omega^*[-1]$.
Defining the Laplacian as $\laplacian \da \delta d + d\delta$, and a differential $n\dash$form is harmonic of $\laplacian \omega= 0$.
Recall that Hodge theorem: there is an isomorphism

??

So there are harmonic representatives for de Rham cohomology classes.

Assume $X$ is a smooth projective complex variety, or more generally a KÃ¤hler.
There is a decomposition \( \Omega_X^n \tensor_\RR \CC = \bigoplus _{p+q=n} \Omega^{p, q}_X \) which is $p$ exterior powers of \( \Omega^{1, 0} \) wedge with $q$ exterior powers of \( \Omega^{0, 1} \).
There is also a decomposition $d = \del + \delbar$ with $\del$ raises degree $p$ by 1 and $\delbar$ raises degree $q$ by 1.
There are formal adjoints to $\del, \delbar$, and one defines $\laplacian_d, \laplacian_{\del}, \laplacian_{\delbar}$ analogously.
There are Kahler identities:
\[
\laplacian_d = 2 \laplacian_{\del} = 2\laplacian_{\delbar}
.\]

:::{.theorem title="?"}
There is a decomposition 
\[
H^n(X; \CC) \cong \bigoplus _{p+q = n} H^{p, q}(X)
.\]
where 
\[
H^{p, q} = D^p_{\Dolbeaut}(X; \Omega_X^q) = \mathcal{H}^{p, q}(X)
,\]
and the latter is the vector space of harmonic forms of degree $p, q$.

:::{.remark}
This data yields a finite decreasining filtration $F$ together with a conjugate filtration $\bar F$ on $H^{p, q}$ where $F_p(H) \intersect \bar{F}_p(H) = H^n$ and yields a notion of *pure Hodge structure of weight $n$*.

:::{.remark}
By GAGA, there is a correspondence between holomorphic and complex algebro-geometric data for nice enough sheaves.
This mixes 

- Topological data: $H^n(X; \CC)$
- Smooth data: $H^n_{\dR}(X)$ 
- Holomorphic/complex algebro-geometric data: the decomposition into harmonic forms.

Nonabelian Hodge theory is an attempt to categorify this fact.
:::


:::{.theorem title="?"}
There is an equivalence of categories
\[
\correspond{
  \text{Local systems of } \Vect_\CC \\ \text{on }X
}
&\mapstofrom
\correspond{
  \text{Complex vector bundles on } X \\ \text{with a flat connection}
}
\]
:::

:::{.remark}
The right-hand side can be identified with monodromy representations $\rho: \pi_1(X) \to \GL_n(\CC)$.
We'll want $H^1(X; \GL_n(\CC))$ to be the space of such representations.

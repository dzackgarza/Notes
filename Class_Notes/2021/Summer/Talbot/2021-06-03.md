> Jeremey Hanh, MIT: something abelian about commutative ring spectra
> See Tablbot 2017 notes and Richter's survey article "Commutative Ring Spectra".

The 2017 Talbot was on structured ring spectra, i.e. "brave new algebra", where we study $E_n\dash$ring spectra.
Getting the subject off the ground requires many definitions, care of May, EKMM, Lurie, and more.


:::{.remark}
The key objects we'll be considering:

- $\SS$, the initial $E_\infty$ ring spectrum
- Thom $E_\infty$ring spectra: $\MO, \MSO, \MSp, \MStr, \Mu$, and the sphere fits into this pattern as framed bordism

We construct *other* $E_\infty$ rings primarily to study these motivating examples.

:::{.example title="?"}
A ring spectrum that shows up naturally when ?:
 $\MU$, for which $\pi_* \MU \cong \ZZ[x_1, x_2, \cdots]$ where each $\abs{x_i} = 2i$.
Localing at a prime $p$ splits $\MU_{(p)}$ into  sum of suspensions $\BP$ where $\pi* \BP = \ZZ_{(p)}[x_1, x_2, \cdots]$ with $\avs{x_i} = 2p^i - 2$.
We can write $\BP = \MU / \gens{x_j \st j\neq p^i - 1}$.
So $\BP$ has simpler homotopy, and $\MU$ splits into a sum of copies of $\BP$, which are easier to work with because the homotopy is more sparsely distributed.
$\BP$ is a bit of a "designer" spectrum, and $\MU$ is more geometric.

:::{.question}
Does this splitting preserve the face that $\MU$ is an $E_\infty$ ring spectrum?
I.e. is $\BP$ an $E_\infty$ ring spectrum?
:::


:::{.answer}
No! See Lawson and Senger, who prove that $\BP$ not an $E_{2p^2 + q}\dash$ring spectrum.
It turns out that understanding the $E_4$ structure is sufficient for many applications.
:::


:::{.theorem title="Basterra, Mandell"}
$\BP$ is an $E_4\dash$algebra retract of $\MU$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Some open questions:

1. Is $\BP$ and $E_5\dash\MU\dash$algebra?
2. The $E_n$ operad acts on $\BP$, so is $\BP$ a $\Disk_2\dash$algebra?
  In particular, can one take factorization homology against unframed surfaces?
  This would correspond to a trivial $S^1\dash$action.
:::


:::{.remark}
Studying other $E_\infty$rings naturally leads to problems in obstruction theory.
We study $\SS$ via chromatic homotopy theory.
The basic strategy:

- Resolve $\SS$ by other $E_\infty$ rings, namely the $K(n)\dash$local sphere $L_{K(n)} \SS$.
  Note that this is a Bousfield localization.
  This is useful precisely because of the chromatic convergence theorem, and one can build a tower whose associated graded are these local spheres.

- Resolve $L_{K(n)} \SS$ for a fixed $n$ by the Hopkins-Miller $\EO\dash$theories, which are $E_\infty$ rings of the form $E_n^{hG}$ for $G$ a finite group acting on the height $n$ Morava $E\dash$theory $E_n$.

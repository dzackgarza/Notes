> Jeremey Hanh, MIT: something abelian about commutative ring spectra
> See Tablbot 2017 notes and Richter's survey article "Commutative Ring Spectra".

The 2017 Talbot was on structured ring spectra, i.e. "brave new algebra", where we study $E_n\dash$ring spectra.
Getting the subject off the ground requires many definitions, care of May, EKMM, Lurie, and more.


:::{.remark}
The key objects we'll be considering:

- $\SS$, the initial $E_\infty$ ring spectrum
- Thom $E_\infty$ring spectra: $\MO, \MSO, \MSp, \MStr, \Mu$, and the sphere fits into this pattern as framed bordism

We construct *other* $E_\infty$ rings primarily to study these motivating examples.

:::{.example title="?"}
A ring spectrum that shows up naturally when ?:
 $\MU$, for which $\pi_* \MU \cong \ZZ[x_1, x_2, \cdots]$ where each $\abs{x_i} = 2i$.
Localing at a prime $p$ splits $\MU_{(p)}$ into  sum of suspensions $\BP$ where $\pi* \BP = \ZZ_{(p)}[x_1, x_2, \cdots]$ with $\avs{x_i} = 2p^i - 2$.
We can write $\BP = \MU / \gens{x_j \st j\neq p^i - 1}$.
So $\BP$ has simpler homotopy, and $\MU$ splits into a sum of copies of $\BP$, which are easier to work with because the homotopy is more sparsely distributed.

:::{.question}
Does this splitting preserve the face that $\MU$ is an $E_\infty$ ring spectrum?
I.e. is $\BP$ an $E_\infty$ ring spectrum?

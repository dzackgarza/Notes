## Setup and Strategy

References: see Randal-Williams and Wahl.

We'll follow a strategy going back to Quillen, reconstructed from some sun-bleached physical notes.


:::{.theorem title="Nakaoka"}
The following sequence exhibits homological stability:
\[
\B \Sigma_0 \mapsvia{\sigma} \B \Sigma_1 \mapsvia{\sigma} \B \Sigma_2 \to \cdots
.\]

More precisely, the following map is a surjection for $i\leq n/2$ and an isomorphism if $i\leq (n-1)/2$:
\[
\sigma_*: H_i \B \Sigma_n; \ZZ) \to H_i(\B \Sigma_{n+1}; \ZZ)
.\]

:::{.remark}
Modern: identify $\sSets \cong \Spaces$ and categories with their nerves.
For \(G\dash\)sets, we can take homotopy quotients by the action of $G$.
Can construct $\B G$ as geometric realization of a nerve, or a homotopy quotient: $\B G \homotopic \pt \hq G$.

:::{.fact}
Some properties of $X \hg G$:

- They are natural, in the sense that if $X \mapsvia{f} Y$ is $G\dash$equivariant, so $gf(x) = f(gx)$, then there is a map $X \hq \to Y\hq G$?

- They preserve **homological connectivity**, where $f:X\to Y$ is homologically $n\dash$connected if $f_*$ is surjective for $i\leq d$ and an isomorphism for $i\leq d-1$.
  So if $X \mapsvia{f} Y$ is $d\dash$connected, then $f\hq G: X\hq G \to Y\hq G$ is $d\dash$connected

- They commute with geometric realisations:
  If $X_\bullet$ is a semi-simplicial $G\dash$space, then $\norm{X_\bullet} \hq G \homotopic \norm{ X_\bullet \hq G}$.

- Homotopy quotients of transitive \(G\dash\)sets, so 
\[
\B \Stab_G(s) \ts{ s } \hq \Stab_G(s) \homotopic S \hq G
.\]

:::{.remark}
We'll use these properties to make inductive arguments.

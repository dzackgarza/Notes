# Lecture 2 (Thursday, May 06)

## Setup and Strategy

References: see Randal-Williams and Wahl.

We'll follow a strategy going back to Quillen, reconstructed from some sun-bleached physical notes.


:::{.theorem title="Nakaoka"}
The following sequence exhibits homological stability:
\[
\B \Sigma_0 \mapsvia{\sigma} \B \Sigma_1 \mapsvia{\sigma} \B \Sigma_2 \to \cdots
.\]

More precisely, the following map is a surjection for $i\leq n/2$ and an isomorphism if $i\leq (n-1)/2$:
\[
\sigma_*: H_i \B \Sigma_n; \ZZ) \to H_i(\B \Sigma_{n+1}; \ZZ)
.\]

:::{.remark}
Modern: identify $\sSets \cong \Spaces$ and categories with their nerves.
For \(G\dash\)sets, we can take homotopy quotients by the action of $G$.
Can construct $\B G$ as geometric realization of a nerve, or a homotopy quotient: $\B G \homotopic \pt \hq G$.

:::{.fact}
Some properties of $X \hg G$:

- They are natural, in the sense that if $X \mapsvia{f} Y$ is $G\dash$equivariant, so $gf(x) = f(gx)$, then there is a map $X \hq \to Y\hq G$?

- They preserve **homological connectivity**, where $f:X\to Y$ is homologically $n\dash$connected if $f_*$ is surjective for $i\leq d$ and an isomorphism for $i\leq d-1$.
  So if $X \mapsvia{f} Y$ is $d\dash$connected, then $f\hq G: X\hq G \to Y\hq G$ is $d\dash$connected

- They commute with geometric realisations:
  If $X_\bullet$ is a semi-simplicial $G\dash$space, then $\norm{X_\bullet} \hq G \homotopic \norm{ X_\bullet \hq G}$.

- Homotopy quotients of transitive \(G\dash\)sets, so 
\[
\B \Stab_G(s) \ts{ s } \hq \Stab_G(s) \homotopic S \hq G
.\]

We'll use these properties to make inductive arguments.

## Injective Words


:::{.remark}
We'll define $\Delta$ as non-empty finite ordered sets and order-preserving maps, and write $[p] \da (0 < \cdots < p)$.
A **simplicial category** is a functor
\[
\Delta^\op \mapsvia{X_\bullet} \cat{C} 
,\]
where you can take $\cat{C} = \Set, \Top$, etc.
We'll define $X_p \da X([p])$.
We'll have face maps $\delta_i: [p-1] \to [p]$ which skips $i$, and degeneracy maps $\sigma_i: [p] \to [p-1]$ which double the $i$th entry.
We can then define
\[
\norm{X_\bullet} \da \qty{ \disjoint_{p\geq 0} \Delta^p \cross X_p} / \sim
.\]
Life will be easier if we forget the degeneracy maps, these will be **semi-simplicial sets**.
Slightly better homotopically behave, can ignore some cofibrancy conditions, and importantly these are *smaller* than simplicial sets.

:::{.remark}
First step: in $\pt \hq \Sigma_n$, replace $\pt$ with $\norm{\complex{X}}$ for $\complex{X} \in \sSets^\semi$.
Notationally, we'll write $X$ as $\complex{ W_n( \ul{1} ) }$.
We'll build a category $\FI \leq \FinSet$ in the next lecture, whose objects are finite sets and morphisms are injections.
We'll define $W_n(\ul 1)_p$ as the semisimplicial set whose $p\dash$simplices are given by $\Hom_{\FI}([p], \ul{n} )$ where $\ul{n} = \ts{ 1, 2, \cdots, n }$.
The face maps are induced by precomposing with $\delta_i$.
:::


:::{.example title="Injective words"}
Set $W_n(\ul 1) _p$ to be sequences $(m_0, m_1, \cdots, m_p)$ with each $m_i \in \ul{n}$.
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
$W_2(1)_\bullet$: note that $W_n$ has up to $n\dash$simplices in general, and here

- 0-simplices: $(1), (2)$,
- 1-simplices: $(1,2), (2, 1)$.

Taking the geometric realization yields a circle:

:::


:::{.example title="?"}
$\complex{ W_3(\ul 1)}$:

- 0-simplices: $(1), (2), (3)$
- 1-simplices: there are 6 
- 2-simplices: again 6

In general, the number of $(n-1)\dash$simplices is $n!$.

One can check homological connectivity.
After the gluing loops will become nullhomotopic:

![image_2021-05-06-12-02-07](figures/image_2021-05-06-12-02-07.png)

Here it's easy to just compute the fundamental groupoid.
:::


:::{.proposition title="?"}
\envlist

1. $\norm{ \complex{ W_n(\ul 1) }}$ is homologically $(n-1)/2\dash$connective.
2. $W_n(\ul 1)_p$ is a transitive $\Sigma_n\dash$set and the stabilizer of $x\in W_n(\ul 1)_p$ is isomorphic to $\Sigma_{n-p-1}$.

:::


:::{.remark}
**Upshot**: $\norm{ \complex{ W_n(\ul 1) }}$ can serve as a replacement for $\pt$ in $\pt\hq \Sigma_n$ in the ranges we are interested in.
:::


:::{.remark}
Next step: exploit the fact that geometric realizations come with a natural filtration, and thus there is a spectral sequence.

## Proof of LES Associated to a SES

Suppose we have a SES of chain complexes
\[
0 \to A \mapsvia{f} B \mapsvia{g} C \to 0
,\]
which means that for every $n$ there is a SES of \(R\dash\)modules.
Recall the diagram for the snake lemma, involving kernels across the top and cokernels across the bottom/
By hypothesis, $\coker g = 0$ and $\ker f = 0$.
There is also a SES 

\[
A_n / d A_{n+1} 
\to 
B_n / d B_{n+1} 
\to 
C_n / d C_{n+1} 
\to 
0
\]

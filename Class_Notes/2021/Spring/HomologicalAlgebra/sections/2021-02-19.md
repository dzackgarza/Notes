:::{.remark}
We looked at $B\in \bimod{R}{S}$ and showed $\wait \tensor_R B: \mods{R} \to \mods{S}$ is left adjoint to hom, and has left-derived functors $\Tor_n^R(\wait, B) \da L_n(\wait \tensor_R B)$.
Note that $\Tor_0(A, B) \cong A\tensor_R B$.

:::{.remark}
$A\tensor_R \wait$ is also right exact, and it turns out that $L_n(A\tensor_R \wait)(B) \cong L_n(\wait \tensor_R B)(A)$.

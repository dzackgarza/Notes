Last time: we looked at group extensions.
Given $\xi: 0\to B\to X \to A\to 0$, we had a canonical element in $\Ext^1(A, B)$, namely $\Theta(\xi) = \delta(\one_B)$.
This only depends on the equivalence class of $\xi$.


:::{.theorem title="?"}
Given $A, B\in \modr$, there is a bijection
\[
\correspond{
  \text{Extensions of $A$ by $B$}
}
\Theta
&\mapstofrom
\Psi
\correspond{
  \Exxt^1(A, B)
}
\]

:::{.proof title="?"}


:::{.claim}
$\Theta$ is surjective.

Fix a SES 
\[
0 \to M \mapsvia{j} P \mapsvia{\pi} A \to 0 
\]
with $P$ projective, and take the LES resulting from applying $\Hom(\wait, B)$:

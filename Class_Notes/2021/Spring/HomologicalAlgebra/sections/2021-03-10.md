 :::{.lemma}
Last time: started setting up group homology.
For $G$ a group and $A\in \modsleft{G}$, we think of $\ZZ$ as a trivial \(G\dash\)module and

1. $A_G \cong \ZZ \tensor_{\ZZ G} A$, the $G\dash$coinvariants.

2. $A^G \cong \Hom_{\ZZ G}( \ZZ, A)$.
  the $G\dash$invariants, this is the largest $G\dash$trivial submodule of $A$

:::{.definition title="?"}
For $A\in \modsleft{G}$,

1. $H_*(G; A) \da L_*(\wait))G (A)$ are the **homology groups of $G$ with coefficients in $A$**.
  It is isomorphic to $\Tor_*^{\ZZ G}(\ZZ, A)$ by (1) in the lemma above.
  In particular, $H_0(G; A) \cong A_G$.

2. $H^*(G; A) \da R^*(\wait)^G(A)$ is the **cohomology of $G$ with coefficients in $A$**.
  It is isomorphic to $\Ext^*_{\ZZ G}(\ZZ, A)$ by (2) in the lemma.
  In particular, $H^0(G; A) \cong A^G$.

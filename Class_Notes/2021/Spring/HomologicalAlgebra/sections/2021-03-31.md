Last time we talked about hypercohomology and hyper derived functors, and we proved that two spectra sequences converging to $\LL_{p+q}F(A)$.

## Grothendieck Spectral Sequences


:::{.remark}
We'll focus on the cohomological version, which gives a spectral sequence from a composition of functors.
Let $\cat{A}, \cat{B}, \cat{C}$ be abelian categories with enough injectives, and let $G: \cat{A} \to \cat{B}$, $F: \cat{B} \to \cat{C}$ be left exact functors.
By a previous result, $FG:\cat{A} \to \cat{C}$ is left exact, which follows from checking that it preserves 4-term exact sequences.
Recall that $B \in \cat{B}$ is $F\dash$acyclic if $R^i F(B) = 0$ for all $i>0$.

:::{.theorem title="Grothendieck Spectral Sequence"}
Assume the above setup, and that $G$ sends injectives in $\cat{A}$ to $F\dash$acyclic objects in $\cat{B}$.
Then there is a convergent QI spectral sequence for each $A \in \cat{A}$:
\[
E_2^{p, q} = (R^p F)(R^q G)(A) \abuts R^{p+q}(FG)(A)
.\]
The edge maps are the natural maps 
\[
(R^p F)(GA) &\to R^p(FG)(A) \\
R^q (FG)(A) &\to F( R^qG(A))
.\]
The exact sequences of the low-degree terms are

\[
0 \to (R^jF)(GA) \to R^j(FG)(A) \to F(R^j G(A)) \to (R^j F)(GA) \to R^j(FG)(A)
.\]

:::{.proof title="?"}
Choose an injective resolution $A\injects I$ in $\cat{A}$ and apply $G$ to form the cochain complex

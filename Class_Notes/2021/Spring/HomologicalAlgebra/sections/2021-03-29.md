Last time: we talked about hypercohomology.
We're doing this so we can set up a Grothendieck spectral sequence.


:::{.definition title="?"}
Let $f, g:D\to E$ be two maps between double complexes.
A **chain homotopy** from $f$ to $g$ consists of $s_{p, q}^h: D_{p, q} \to E_{p+1, q}$ and $s_{p, q}^v: D_{p, q} \to E_{p, q+1}$ for all $p, q$ satisfying the following conditions:

1. $g-f$

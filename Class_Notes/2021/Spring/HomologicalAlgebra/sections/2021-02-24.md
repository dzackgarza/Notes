We were trying to prove that taking the left derived functors of the two slots in $\Tor$ yield the same thing.

We'll need the following:

:::{.claim}
This induces a *quasi-isomorphism*
\[
P\tensor B \fromvia{1\tensor \eta} \Tor(P\tensor Q) \mapsvia{\eps \tensor \one} \Tot(A\tensor Q) = A\tensor Q
,\]
i.e. it is a morphism that induces an isomorphism on homology.

Recall that by Corollary 1.5, a chain complex is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if the cone complex is acyclic/exact.
In degree $n$ of the total complex, the $n$th piece is the $n$th diagonal and we have
\[
(P_n \tensor Q_0)
\oplus \cdots \oplus 
(P_0 \tensor Q_n)
.\]
where $P_0 \mapsvia{\eps \tensor \one A \tensor Q_n}$.
Recall that for a map \( B_n \mapsvia{f} C_n \), the cone complex was given by

We were trying to prove that taking the left derived functors of the two slots in $\Tor$ yield the same thing.

:::{.proof title="?"}
We'll need the following:

:::{.claim}
This induces a quasi-isomorphism
\[
\Tor(P\tensor Q) \mapsvia{\eps \tensor \one} \Tot(A\tensor Q) = A\tensor Q
,\]
i.e. it induces an isomorphism on homology.

## 5.4: Spectral Sequence from a Filtration


:::{.remark}
We have an increasing filtration $F_p C \subseteq F_{p+1}C$, where we defined
\[
E_{p, q}^0 = { F_p C_{p+q} \over F_{p-1} C_{p+1} } &&
E_{p,q}^1 = H_{p+q} E_{p, *}^0
.\]
We have a map
\[
\eta_p: F_p C \surjects {F_p C \over F_{p-1}C } = E_p^0
,\]
where we've dropped the $q$ from notation, and 
\[
A_{p, q}^r = \ts{ c \in C_p C \st dc \in F_{p-1} C } 
,\]
the eventual cycles.
We defined $Z_p^r = \eta_p A_p^r$ and $B_p^r \eta_p dA_{p+r-1}^{r-1}$, and wrote $A_p^r \intersect F_{p-1}C = A_{p-1}^{r-1}$.
We had the chain of inclusions
\[
0 = B_p^r \subseteq \cdots \subseteq B_p^{\infty} \subset Z_p^{\infty } \subset \cdots \subseteq Z_p^1 = E_p^)
.\]
We also have $E_p^r = Z_p^r/B_p^r = A_p^r / dA_{p+r-1}^{r-1} + A_{p-1}^{r-1}

## 5.4: Spectral Sequence from a Filtration


:::{.remark}
We have an increasing filtration $F_p C \subseteq F_{p+1}C$, where we defined
\[
E_{p, q}^0 = { F_p C_{p+q} \over F_{p-1} C_{p+1} } &&
E_{p,q}^1 = H_{p+q} E_{p, *}^0
.\]
We have a map
\[
\eta_p: F_p C \surjects {F_p C \over F_{p-1}C } = E_p^0
.\]

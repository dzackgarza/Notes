## 5.4: Spectral Sequence From a Filtration

:::{.remark}
We have an increasing filtration $F_p C \subseteq F_{p+1}C$, where we defined
\[
E_{p, q}^0 = { F_p C_{p+q} \over F_{p-1} C_{p+1} } &&
E_{p,q}^1 = H_{p+q} E_{p, *}^0
.\]
We have a map
\[
\eta_p: F_p C \surjects {F_p C \over F_{p-1}C } = E_p^0
,\]
where we've dropped the $q$ from notation.

2. 
\[
A_{p, q}^r = \ts{ c \in C_p C \st dc \in F_{p-1} C } 
,\]
the eventual cycles.
We defined $Z_p^r = \eta_p A_p^r$ and $B_p^r \eta_p dA_{p+r-1}^{r-1}$, and wrote $A_p^r \intersect F_{p-1}C = A_{p-1}^{r-1}$.

3. We had the chain of inclusions
\[
0 = B_p^r \subseteq \cdots \subseteq B_p^{\infty} \subset Z_p^{\infty } \subset \cdots \subseteq Z_p^1 = E_p^)
.\]

4. We also have $E_p^r = Z_p^r/B_p^r = A_p^r / dA_{p+r-1}^{r-1} + A_{p-1}^{r-1}$ 

5. $Z_{p}^{r+1}/B_pr \cong {A_p^{r+1} +A_{p-1}^{r-1} \over dA_{p+r-1} ^{r-1} + A_{p-1}^{r-1}}$.

6. $dA_p^r \intersect F_{p-r-1} C = dA_P^{r+1}$.

\todo[inline]{See video for missed spoken details!}

Obviously we have 
\[
d: A_p^r &\to A_{p-r}^{r} \\
d: A_{p-1}^r &\to dA_{p-1}^{r-1} 
,\]
so $d$ induces a well-defined map $d_p^r: E_p^r \mapsvia{} E_{p-r}^r$, which of course squares to zero, which goes $r$ columns to the left and decreases the total degree $n$ by 1 since the original $d$ did on $C_n$.
This is what we need to set up a spectral sequence, since we now have pages and differentials, and it just remains to show that $E^{r+1} \cong H_*(E^r, d^r)$.

$d$ determines isomorphisms $Z_{p}^r/Z_p^{r+1} \mapsvia{\sim} B_{p-r}^{r+1} / B_{p-r}^r$.

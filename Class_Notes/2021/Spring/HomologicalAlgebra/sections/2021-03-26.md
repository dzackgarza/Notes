## 5.6: Two Spectral Sequences on Total Complexes


:::{.remark}
Recall that we had two filtrations on a total complex: the first was fixing a vertical line and replacing everything to the right with zeros, which was given by $^{I}E_{p, q}^0 = F_p(\Tot)/ F_{p-1}(\Tot) = C_{p, q}$.
Taking homology with the vertical differentials yielded $^{I}E_{p, q}^1 = H_q^v(C_{p,*})$, and $^{I} E_{p, q}^2 = H_p^h H_q^v(C_{*, *})$.
Applying the classical convergence theorem when this is 1st quadrant yields some spectral sequence with these as the pages which converges to $H_{p+q}(\Tot(C))$.

:::{.definition title="The second filtration"}
We'll define a filtration by rows:
let $^{II}F_n \Tot(C)$ be the total complex of the double complex 
\[
({}^{II} \tau_{\leq n} C)_{p, q}
&=
\begin{cases}
C_{p, q} & p, q\leq  
\\
0 & p, q > n.
\end{cases}
\]
This is the complex gotten by replacing everything below the $n$th row with zeros.
We define the 0th page
\[
{}^{II} E^{0}_{p, q}
= 
{
{}^{II} F_p \Tot(C)_{p+q} 
\over 
{}^{II} F_{p-1} \Tot(C)_{p+q} 
}
 = C_{q, p}
,\]
which follows from the fact that we are modding out a full diagonal by a diagonal with one fewer elements

## 5.6: Two Spectral Sequences on Total Complexes


:::{.remark}
Recall that we had two filtrations on a total complex: the first was fixing a vertical line and replacing everything to the right with zeros, which was given by $^{I}E_{p, q}^0 = F_p(\Tot)/ F_{p-1}(\Tot) = C_{p, q}$.
Taking homology with the vertical differentials yielded $^{I}E_{p, q}^1 = H_q^v(C_{p,*})$, and $^{I} E_{p, q}^2 = H_p^h H_q^v(C_{*, *})$.

## 2.5: Right-Derived Functors

:::{.remark}
Today: right-derived functors of a left-exact functor.
Luckily we can use some opposite category tricks which save us some work of re deriving everything.
:::


:::{.definition title="Right Derived Functors"}
Let \( F: \cat{A} \to \cat{B}  \) be left-exact where \( \cat{A} \) has enough injectives.
Given \( A \in \cat{A} \), fix an injective resolution \( 0 \to A \mapsvia{\eps} I\) and define
\[
R^i \cat{F} \da H^i( FA ) && i \geq 0 
.\]
:::


:::{.remark}
Then 
\[
0 \to FA \mapsvia{F\eps} FI^0 \mapsvia{Fd^)} FI^1
\]
is exact,
and 
\[
R^0 FA = \ker FD^0 / \gens{ 0 } = \im F\eps \cong FA
,\]
and so there is naturally an isomorphism $R^0 F \cong F$.
Observe that \( F \) yields a right-exact functor $F^\op: \cat{A}^\op \to \cat{B}^\op$, where we note that $F^\op (f^\op) = F(f)^\op$.

## 2.5: Right-Derived Functors

:::{.remark}
Today: right-derived functors of a left-exact functor.
Luckily we can use some opposite category tricks which save us some work of re deriving everything.
:::


:::{.definition title="Right Derived Functors"}
Let \( F: \cat{A} \to \cat{B}  \) be left-exact where \( \cat{A} \) has enough injectives.
Given \( A \in \cat{A} \), fix an injective resolution \( 0 \to A \mapsvia{\eps} I\) and define
\[
R^i \cat{F} \da H^i( FA ) && i \geq 0 
.\]
:::


:::{.remark}
Then 
\[
0 \to FA \mapsvia{F\eps} FI^0 \mapsvia{Fd^)} FI^1
\]
is exact,
and 
\[
R^0 FA = \ker FD^0 / \gens{ 0 } = \im F\eps \cong FA
,\]
and so there is naturally an isomorphism $R^0 F \cong F$.
Observe that \( F \) yields a right-exact functor $F^\op: \cat{A}^\op \to \cat{B}^\op$, where we note that $F^\op (f^\op) = F(f)^\op$.
Note that taking the opposite category sends injectives to projectives and so \( \cat{A}^\op \) has enough projectives.
This means that $L_i F^\op$ are defined using the projective resolution $I$, so we have
\[
R^i F(A) = (L_i F^\op)^\op
.\]
Thus all results about left-derived functors translate to right-derived functors:

- $R_i F$ is independent of the choice of injective resolution, up to a natural isomorphism.
- If $A$ is injective, then $R^{i>0} F(A) = 0$.
- The collection \( \ts{ R^i F } _{i\geq 0 } \) forms a universal cohomological \( \delta\dash \)functor for \( F \).
- An object \( Q \in \cat{A} \) is **$F\dash$acyclic** if $R^{>0}F(Q) = 0$.
- $R^iF$ can be computed using $F\dash$acyclic objects instead of injective resolutions.

:::{.definition title="?"}
Fix a right \(R\dash\)module \( M \in \modr \), then $F \da \Hom_{\modr}(M, \wait): \modr \to \Ab$ is a left-exact functor.
Its right-derived functors are **ext functors** and denoted $\Ext_{\modr}^i(M, \wait)$.
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
\( \Ext_{\modr}^i(M, A) = (R^i F)(A) = [ R^i \Hom_{\modr}(M, \wait) ] (A) \).
:::


:::{.remark}
Exercises 2.5.1, 2.5.2 are important extensions of our existing characterizations of injectives and projectives in $\modr$.

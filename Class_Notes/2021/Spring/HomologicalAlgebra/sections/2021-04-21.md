Recall that $\lieg$ was free over $k$ with an ordered basis \( \ts{ e_{\alpha} \st \alpha\in \Omega } \).
We defined 
\[
V_n(\lieg) \da \Ug \tensor_k \Exterioralg^n \lieg
\]
with a differential \( d = \theta_1 + \theta_2 \).
We claimed that $V_n(\lieg) \surjectsvia{\eps} k$ is a projective resolution, and we were showing that $V_*$ was an exact complex.

:::{.proof title="of theorem, continued"}
We define a filtration
\[
F_p V_n \da k \gens{ e_I \tensor e_{ \alpha_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{\alpha_n} \st I = [\elts{\beta}{m}], \alpha_1 \leq \cdots \leq \alpha_n,\, m+n\leq p } 
.\]
Note that $d: F_p V_n \to F_p V_{n-1}$, and in fact $\theta_2$ maps into $F_{p-1} V_{n-1}$.
It lands in the same complex since we can rearrange elements in the sum defining the differential to express everything in terms of the given basis, where every expression will be of length one less. 
The commutation relation was 
\[
e_{ \beta} e_{\alpha} = e_{\alpha} e_{\beta} + [e_{\beta} e_{ \alpha} ]
.\]

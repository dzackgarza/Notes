Recall that $\lieg$ was free over $k$ with an ordered basis \( \ts{ e_{\alpha} \st \alpha\in \Omega } \).
We defined 
\[
V_n(\lieg) \da \Ug \tensor_k \Exterioralg^n \lieg
\]
with a differential \( d = \theta_1 + \theta_2 \).
We claimed that $V_n(\lieg) \surjectsvia{\eps} k$ is a projective resolution, and we were showing that $V_*$ was an exact complex.

:::{.proof title="of theorem, continued"}
We define a filtration
\[
F_p V_n \da k \gens{ e_I \tensor e_{ \alpha_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{\alpha_n} \st I = [\elts{\beta}{m}], \alpha_1 \leq \cdots \leq \alpha_n,\, m+n\leq p } 
.\]
Note that $d: F_p V_n \to F_p V_{n-1}$, and in fact $\theta_2$ maps into $F_{p-1} V_{n-1}$.
We'll focus on $\theta_1$ for simplicity.
It lands in the same complex since we can rearrange elements in the sum defining the differential to express everything in terms of the given basis, where every expression will be of length one less. 
The commutation relation was 
\[
e_{ \beta} e_{\alpha} = e_{\alpha} e_{\beta} + [e_{\beta} e_{ \alpha} ]
,\]
where the left-hand side is degree 2, and the right-hand side is a degree 2 term plus a degree 1 term.
Moreover $d$ preserves the filtration: when rearranging, the degree $u$ term in $\theta_1$ will decrease to $m-1$, the expression following it may increase to $n+1$, and $(m-1) + (n+1) = m+n$.
So $F_p V_*$ is a subcomplex of $V_*$, and we have
\[
0 = F_{-1} V_* \subseteq F_0 V_* \subseteq \cdots \subseteq F_p V_* \subseteq V_* = \Union_{p\geq 0} F_p V_*
,\]
which is not a finite filtration, but is bounded below and exhaustive.
So by the canonical convergence theorem (Weibel 5.5.1), there is a convergent spectral sequence
\[
E_{p, q}^0 \da {F_p V_{p+q} \over F_{p-1} V_{p+q} } \abuts H_{p+q}(V_*(\lieg))
.\]

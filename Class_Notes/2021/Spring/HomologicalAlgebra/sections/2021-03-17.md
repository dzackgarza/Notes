## 5.2: Spectral Sequences

Recall that we had 

- \( \ts{ E_{p, q}^r } \st r\geq a, p,q\in \ZZ \) for some $a$
- \( d_{p, q}^r: E_{p, q}^r \to E_{p-r, q+r-1} \) with $d^2=0$.
- \( E_{p, q}^{r+1} \cong \ker d_{p, q}^r / \im d_{p+r,q-r+1}^r \) 


:::{.example title="First quadrant spectral sequences"}
A **first quadrant** (homology) spectral sequence is one with $E_{p, q}^r = 0$ for $p, q<0$.
Note that for a fixed $p, q$, there is an $r \gg 0$ such that the differential entering and leaving $E_{p, q}^r$ will be zero.
The domain will be in quadrant 2 and the codomain in quadrant 4.
In this case $E_{p, q}^r \cong E_{p, q}^{r+1}$ and we call this "stable" module $E_{p, q}^{\infty }$.
Note that $r=r(p, q)$ can generally depend on $p, q$.

:::{.definition title="Bounded"}
We say a spectral sequence is **bounded** if there are only finitely many nonzero terms of total degree $n$.
If so, there exists some uniform $r_0$ such that for $r\geq r_0$, we have $E_{r}_{p, q} \cong E_{p, q}^{r+1} \cong E_{p, q}^{\infty }$.

# Problem Set 5  

:::{.problem title="Weibel 6.1.1"}
Let $A\in\rmod$. 
Show that $A^G \leq A$ is the maximal $G\dash$trivial submodule, and conclude that if $\Triv$ is defined as the trivial module functor, there is an adjunction
\[
\adjunction{\Triv}{(\wait)^G}
{\Ab}{\modsleft{G}}
,\]
so taking invariants is a right-adjoint.
Conclude that $(\wait)^G$ is left-exact.
:::

:::{.solution}
That $A^G\leq A$ is the maximal trivial $G\dash$trivial submodule is clear: if there were any $A'$ such that $A^G \leq A' \leq A$ with $A'$ being $G\dash$trivial, we would have $ga' = a'$ for all $a' \in A'$.
This would imply $a'\in A^G$ by definition, so $A'\leq A^g$ and this forces $A^G = A'$.

Moreover, since right adjoints are left-exact, it suffices to show the adjunction exists. 
The claim is that there is a natural isomorphism between the sets of morphisms
\[
\Ab(A, M^G) &\mapscorrespond{\Theta}{\Psi} \modsleft{G}(\Triv(A), M)\\
(A \mapsvia{f} M^G) &\mapsto (A \mapsvia{\tilde f} M^G \injects M) \\
(A \mapsvia{\tilde w} M^G) &\mapsfrom (\Triv(A) \mapsvia{g} M)
.\]

:::{.claim}
$\Theta$ is well-defined: 
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
We use the fact that as sets, $A \cong \Triv(A)$, and so there is a set map $\tilde f: \Triv(A) \to M^G$. 
Since $M_G \leq M$ also has the structure of a sub $G\dash$module, there is a canonical inclusion $\iota \in \Hom_G(M^G, M)$, and so we can define the set map $\Triv(A) \mapsvia{F \da \iota \circ \tilde f}  M$.

To see that $F \da \Theta(f) \in \Hom_{G}(\Triv(A), M)$ is actually a morphism in $\modsleft{G}$, we check:

- $f(a_1 + a_2) = f(a_1) + f(a_2) \in M$: This is true since the equation already holds in $\Ab$, and
- $f(ga) = gf(a)$: This holds because 
  -Considering the RHS, since $\im f \subseteq M^G \implies \im F \subseteq M^G$, we have $gf(a) = f(a)$.
  - Considering the LHS, since $\Triv(A)$ has a trivial $G\dash$action, we have $ga = a$ and thus $f(ga) = f(a)$.

$\Psi$ is well-defined.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
This follows from the fact that if $h\in \Hom_{G}(\Triv(A), M)$ we must have $h(ga) = gh(a)$ by virtue of being a \(G\dash\)module morphism.
But since $a\in \Triv(A)$, we have $ga= a$, so $h(ga) = h(a)$.
Combining these we have $gh(a) = h(a)$, and so $h(a)\in M^G$ and \( \im h \subseteq M^G \), so restricting the codomain yields a set map $\tilde h: A\to M^G$.
That this is a morphism of abelian groups follows from the fact that the equation $h(a_1 + a_2) = h(a_1) + h(a_2)$ holds for the original $h$, so $\tilde h$ satisfies this equation as well.
:::

:::{.claim}
\( \Theta, \Psi \) are mutually inverse, yielding an isomorphism of sets.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
We can characterize $\Theta$ as first regarding the set map $f:A\to M^G$ as a \(G\dash\)module map $f:\Triv(A) \to M^G$ and then extending the codomain to $M$. 
If $f\in \Ab(A, M^G)$, noting that its codomain is already $M^G$, taking $(\Psi \Theta)(f)$ is extending codomain to $M$ followed by restricting codomain back $M^G$, so this recovers $f$.
Similarly, if $h\in \Hom_{G}(\Triv(A), M)$, the composition $(\Theta \Psi)(h)$ is restricting codomain to $M^G$ and then extending it back to $M$, which recovers $h$.
Thus these two sets of morphisms are isomorphic.

The isomorphism is natural, so for $f\in \Hom_{\Ab}(A, B)$ and $g\in \Hom_G(M, N)$, the following diagram commutes:

:::{.proof title="?"}
That the first square commutes follows from tracing out the two paths: taking $h: \Triv(B) \to M$ and first going down and right yields
\[
h \mapsto \Psi_{BM}(h) \mapsto f\circ \Psi_{BM}(h) \in \Hom_\Ab(A, M^G)
,\]
and now going right and down yields
\[
h \mapsto Lf \circ h \mapsto \Psi_{AM}(Lf \circ h)
\in \Hom_\Ab(A, M^G)
.\]
We want to show that these functions are equal, so it suffices to check that they take the same value on every element.
This is clear from the fact that all of the $\Psi$ maps were given by restriction of codomain, and do not alter the underlying set functions, and so we have
\[
(f \circ \Psi_{BM}(h))(a) = f( \Psi_{BM}(h)(a)) = f(h(a)) && \forall a\in A
\]
and
\[
(\Psi_AM(Lf \circ h))(a) = Lf (h(a) = f(h(a)) && \forall a\in A
,\]
where in the last equality we've used that if $f\in \Hom_\Ab(A, B)$ then $Lf \in \Hom_G(\Triv(A), \Triv(B))$ is the same underlying set map.

The right-hand square commutes by a similar argument: for $g \in \Hom_{G}(M, N)$, the map $Rg\in \Hom_\Ab(M^G, N^G)$ is given by restriction of $g$ to a submodule.
Fixing $h\in \Hom_G(\Triv(A), M)$, we trace out
\[
h \mapsto \Psi_{AM}(h) \mapsto 
\Psi_{AM}(h) \circ Rg
\]
and 
\[
h\mapsto 
h \circ g \mapsto 
\Psi_{AN}(h\circ g)
,\]
so we want to show
\[
(\Psi_{AM}(h) \circ Rg)(a) =
(\Psi_{AN}(h\circ g))(a) && \forall a\in \Triv(A)
.\]
We again use that $\Psi$ doesn't alter set-level values, so
\[
(\Psi_{AM}(h) \circ Rg) (a)
=
\Psi_{AM}(h)( Rg(a) )
= h (Rg(a))
.\]
and 
\[
(\Psi_{AN}(h\circ g))(a) 
= (h\circ g)(a) 
= h(g(a))
.\]
Finally, we note that since $a\in \Triv(A)$, every $g(a)$ is actually in $M^G$, and so $g(a) = Rg(a)$ at the level of sets.
So these maps are equal.

Let $A\in \rmod$.
Show that $A_G$ is the largest trivial quotient module of $A$, and conclude that there is an adjunction
\[
\adjunction{(\wait)_G}{\Triv}{\modsleft{G}}{\rmod}
.\]
:::

:::{.solution}
Define a map
\[
\Hom_G(M, \Triv(A)) &\to \Hom_\Ab(M_G, A) \\
f &\mapsto \bar f \\
\tilde h &\mapsfrom h
\]
where we realize $M_G \da M/ \gens{ gm-m }$ and take $\bar f$ to be the natural quotient map:

% https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMyxbMCwwLCJNIl0sWzAsMiwiTV9HIl0sWzIsMCwiQSJdLFswLDIsImYiXSxbMSwyLCJcXHRpbGRlIGYiLDJdLFswLDEsIlxccGkiLDJdXQ==

	M && A \\
	\\
	{M_G \da M/R \da M / \gens{ gm-m } }
	\arrow["f", from=1-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{\tilde f}"', from=3-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["\pi"', from=1-1, to=3-1]
\end{tikzcd}

and given $h: M_G \to A$, we define $\tilde h = h\circ \pi$, so
\[
\tilde h: M &\to \Triv(A) \\
m &\mapsto h(\pi(m)) 
.\]

That $f$ descends to a well-defined map on the quotient follows from the fact that $ga = a$ for all $g$ and all $a\in \Triv(A)$, so $f(gm-m) = gf(m) - f(m)$, which is of the form $ga-a$, and so \( \ker f \subseteq \gens{ ga- a }  \). 
The inverse map is a well-defined \(G\dash\)module morphism, using the fact that since $g$ acts trivially on both sides we have \( gh(m) = h(m) = h(gm) \).

In words, the forward map is descending morphisms to the quotient, and the inverse map is lifting maps from the quotient by composing with the projection.
That these compose to the identity in other order and yield a bijection follows from the commutativity of the triangle for the quotient.
That this is an adjunction follows from naturality of this isomorphism, for which the proof is similar to the one for the previous problem.

1. Show that if $G$ is an infinite group, then $H^0(G; \ZZ G) \cong (\ZZ G)^G = 0$.

2. When $G$ is a finite group, show that the map $\ZZ \cdot N \da (\ZZ G)^G \mapsvia{} (\ZZ G)_G \cong \ZZ$ sends the norm $N$ to $\# G$, and that this is an injection.

3. Conclude that $\mathcal{J} \cong \ker( \ZZ G \mapsvia{N} \ZZ G) = \ts{ a\in \ZZ G \st Na = 0 }$ when $G$ is finite.


:::


:::{.solution}
By definition we have $H^0(G; A) \da A^G$, and lemma 6.1.1, we also have $H^0(G; A) \cong \Hom_{\ZZ G}(\ZZ, A)$ for any $A$.
Taking $A \da \ZZ G$ yields the first isomorphism appearing in (1), so it suffice to show $(\ZZ G)^G = 0$.
We can write
\[
(\ZZ G)^G \da \ts{ \sum_{g_{\alpha}\in G} n_{ \alpha} g_{\alpha}}
.\]

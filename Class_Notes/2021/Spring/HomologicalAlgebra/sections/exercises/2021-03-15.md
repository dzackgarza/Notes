# Problem Set 5  

:::{.problem title="Weibel 6.1.1"}
Let $A\in\rmod$. 
Show that $A^G \leq A$ is the maximal $G\dash$trivial submodule, and conclude that if $\Triv$ is defined as the trivial module functor, there is an adjunction
\[
\adjunction{\Triv}{(\wait)^G}
{\Ab}{\modsleft{G}}
,\]
so taking invariants is a right-adjoint.
Conclude that $(\wait)^G$ is left-exact.

That $A^G\leq A$ is the maximal trivial $G\dash$trivial submodule is clear: if there were any $A'$ such that $A^G \leq A' \leq A$ with $A'$ being $G\dash$trivial, we would have $ga' = a'$ for all $a' \in A'$.
This would imply $a'\in A^G$ by definition, so $A'\leq A^g$ and this forces $A^G = A'$.

To show the desired adjunction, the claim is that there is a natural isomorphism between the sets of morphisms
\[
\Ab(A, M^G) &\mapscorrespond{\Theta}{\Psi} \modsleft{G}(\Triv(A), M)\\
(A \mapsvia{f} M^G) &\mapsto (A \mapsvia{\tilde f} M^G \injects M) \\
(A \mapsvia{\tilde g} M^G) &\mapsfrom (\Triv(A) \mapsvia{g} M)
.\]

First, $\Theta$ is well-defined: we use the fact that as sets, $A \cong \Triv(A)$, and so there is a set map $\tilde f: \Triv(A) \to M^G$. 
Post-composing this with the canonical inclusion $M^G \injectsvia{\iota} M$ (since $M^G$ also has the structure of a sub $G\dash$module) yields a set map $\Triv(A) \mapsvia{F \da \iota \circ \tilde f}  M$.

Let $A\in \rmod$.
Show that $A_G$ is the largest trivial quotient module of $A$, and conclude that there is an adjunction
\[
\adjunction{(\wait)_G}{\Triv}{\rmod}{\rmod}

If $G=1\in \Grp$ and let $\ZZ\in\modsleft{G}$ be the trivial \(G\dash\)module.
Show that
\[
A_G = A^G = A
,\]
and thus
\[
H_{\geq 1}(1, A) \cong H^{\geq 1}(1, A) = 0
.\]

Suppose that $E$ is a double complex supported only in columns $p$ and $p-1$ and define $T \da \Totprod(E)$
Fix $n$ and set $q\da n-p$, so that an element of $H_n(T)$ is represented by an element $(a ,b) \in E_{p-1, q+1} \cross E_{p, q}$.
Show that the previous argument (Weibel p. 120-121) computes the homology
"up to extensions" in the sense that there is a SES
\[
0 \to E_{p-1, q+1}^2 \to H_{p+q}(T) \to E_{p, q} \to 0
.\]

Suppose that a spectral sequence converging to $H_*$ has $E^2_{p, q} = 0$ for $p \neq 0, 1$.
Show that there is a family of SESs
\[
0 \to E_{0, n}^2 \to H_n \to E_{1, n-1}^2 \to 0

1. Show that $E_{p, q}^2$ can be presented as 
\[
\ts{ (a, b) \in E_{p-1, q+1} \cross E_{p, q} \st d^v b = d^va + d^h b = 0}
\over
\gens{ (a, 0), \ts{ (d^h x, d^vx) \st x\in E_{p, q+1} }, \ts{ (0, d^h c) \st c\in E_{p+1, q},\, d^v c = 0 }  }  
.\]

2. Show that if $d^h(a) = 0$, any such pair \( (a, b) \) determines an element $H_{p+q}(T)$.

3. Show that the formula $d(a, b) \da (0, d^h(a))$ yields a well-defined map
\[
d:E_{p, q}^2 \to E_{p-2, q+1}^2
.\]

Let $E$ be a first quadrant spectral sequence.
By diagram chasing, show that $E^2_{0, 0} = H_0(T)$ and that there is an exact sequence
\[
H_2(T) \to E_{2, 0}\mapsvia{2} E_{0, 1}^2 \to H_1(T) \to E_{1, 0}^2 \to 0
.\]

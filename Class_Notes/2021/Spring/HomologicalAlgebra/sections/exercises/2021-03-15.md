# Problem Set 5  

:::{.problem title="Weibel 6.1.1"}
Let $A\in\rmod$. 
Show that $A^G \leq A$ is the maximal $G\dash$trivial submodule, and conclude that if $\Triv$ is defined as the trivial module functor, there is an adjunction
\[
\adjunction{\Triv}{(\wait)^G}
{\Ab}{\modsleft{G}}
,\]
so taking invariants is a right-adjoint.
Conclude that $(\wait)^G$ is left-exact.

:::{.solution}
That $A^G\leq A$ is the maximal trivial $G\dash$trivial submodule is clear: if there were any $A'$ such that $A^G \leq A' \leq A$ with $A'$ being $G\dash$trivial, we would have $ga' = a'$ for all $a' \in A'$.
This would imply $a'\in A^G$ by definition, so $A'\leq A^g$ and this forces $A^G = A'$.

To show the desired adjunction, the claim is that there is a natural isomorphism between the sets of morphisms
\[
\Ab(A, M^G) &\mapscorrespond{\Theta}{\Psi} \modsleft{G}(\Triv(A), M)\\
(A \mapsvia{f} M^G) &\mapsto (A \mapsvia{\tilde f} M^G \injects M) \\
(A \mapsvia{\tilde w} M^G) &\mapsfrom (\Triv(A) \mapsvia{g} M)
.\]


:::{.claim}
$\Theta$ is well-defined: 
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
We use the fact that as sets, $A \cong \Triv(A)$, and so there is a set map $\tilde f: \Triv(A) \to M^G$. 
Since $M_G \leq M$ also has the structure of a sub $G\dash$module, there is a canonical inclusion $\iota \in \modsleft{G}(M^G, M)$, and so we can define the set map $\Triv(A) \mapsvia{F \da \iota \circ \tilde f}  M$.

To see that $F \da \Theta(f) \in \modsleft{G}(\Triv(A), M)$ is actually a morphism in $\modsleft{G}$, we check:

- $f(a_1 + a_2) = f(a_1) + f(a_2) \in M$: This is true since the equation already holds in $\Ab$, and
- $f(ga) = gf(a)$: This holds because 
  -Considering the RHS, since $\im f \subseteq M^G \implies \im F \subseteq M^G$, we have $gf(a) = f(a)$.
  - Considering the LHS, since $\Triv(A)$ has a trivial $G\dash$action, we have $ga = a$ and thus $f(ga) = f(a)$.

$\Psi$ is well-defined.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
This follows from the fact that if $h\in \modsleft{G}(\Triv(A), M)$ we must have $h(ga) = gh(a)$ by virtue of being a \(G\dash\)module morphism.
But since $a\in \Triv(A)$, we have $ga= a$, so $h(ga) = h(a)$.
Combining these we have $gh(a) = h(a)$, and so $h(a)\in M^G$ and \( \im h \subseteq M^G \), so restricting the codomain yields a set map $\tilde h: A\to M^G$.
That this is a morphism of abelian groups follows from the fact that the equation $h(a_1 + a_2) = h(a_1) + h(a_2)$ holds for the original $h$, so $\tilde h$ satisfies this equation as well.

:::{.claim}
\( \Theta, \Psi \) are mutually inverse, yielding an isomorphism of sets.
:::


:::{.proof title="?"}
We can characterize $\Theta$ as first regarding the set map $f:A\to M^G$ as a \(G\dash\)module map $f:\Triv(A) \to M^G$ and then extending the codomain to $M$. 
If $f\in \Ab(A, M^G)$, noting that its codomain is already $M^G$, taking $(\Psi \Theta)(f)$ is extending codomain to $M$ followed by restricting codomain back $M^G$, so this recovers $f$.
Similarly, if $h\in \modsleft{G}(\Triv(A), M)$, the composition $(\Theta \Psi)(h)$ is restricting codomain to $M^G$ and then extending it back to $M$, which recovers $h$.
Thus these two sets of morphisms are isomorphic.

:::{.claim}
The isomorphism is natural, so for $f\in \Hom_{\Ab}(A, B)$ and $g\in \Hom_G(M, N)$, the following diagram commutes:

\begin{tikzcd}
	{\Hom_G(\Triv(B), M)} && {\Hom_G(\Triv(A), M)} && {\Hom_G(\Triv(A), N)} \\

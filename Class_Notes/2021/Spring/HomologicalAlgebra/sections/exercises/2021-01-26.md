:::{.problem title="Weibel 1.4.5"}
Show that chain homotopy classes of maps form a quotient category $K$ of $\Ch(\rmod)$ and that the functors $H_n$ factor through the quotient functor $\Ch(\rmod) \to K$ using the following steps:

1. Show that chain homotopy equivalence is an equivalence relation on $\ts{f:C\to D \st f\text{ is a chain map}}$.
  Define $\Hom_K(C, D)$ to be the equivalence classes of such maps and show that it is an abelian group.

2. Let $f \homotopic g: C\to D$ be two chain homotopic maps.
  If $u: B\to C, v:D\to E$ are chain maps, show that $vfu, vgu$ are chain homotopic.
  Deduce that $K$ is a category when the objects are defined as chain complexes and the morphisms are defined as in (1).

3. Let $f_0, f_1, g_0, g_1: C\to D$ all be chain maps such that each pair $f_i \homotopic g_i$ are chain homotopic.
  Show that $f_0 + f_1$ is chain homotopic to $g_0 + g_1$.
  Deduce that $K$ is an additive category and $\Ch(\rmod)\to K$ is an additive functor.

4. Is $K$ an abelian category? 
  Explain.

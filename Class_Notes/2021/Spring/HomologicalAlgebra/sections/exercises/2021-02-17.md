:::{.problem title="Prove Corollary 2.3.2"}
For $R$ a PID, show that an \(R\dash\)module $A$ is divisible if and only if $A$ is injective.

> Recall that a module is *divisible* if and only if for every $r\neq 0 \in R$ and every $a\in A$, we have $a=br$ for some $b\in A$.

:::{.problem title="Calculating Ext Groups"}
Calculate $\Ext_\ZZ^i(\ZZ/p, \ZZ/q)$ for distinct primes $p, q$.
:::

:::{.problem title="Weibel 2.3.2"}
For $A\in \Ab$, define $I(A) \da \bigoplus_{f\in \Hom_\Ab(A, \QQ/\ZZ) } \QQ/\ZZ$, and let $e_A: A\to I(A)$.
Show that $e_A$ is injective.

*Hint: if $a\in A$, find a map $f: a \ZZ\to \QQ/\ZZ$ with $f(a) \neq 0$ and extend this to a map $f': A\to \QQ/\ZZ$.*

:::{.problem title="Weibel 2.4.2"}
If $U: \cat{B} \to \cat{C}$ is an exact functor, show that
\[
U(L_i F) \cong L_i(UF)
.\]
:::

:::{.problem title="Weibel 2.4.3"}
If $0\to M \to P \to A \to 0$ is exact with $P$ projective or $F\dash$acyclic, show that
\[
L_i F(A) \cong L_{i-1}FM && i\geq 2
.\]
Show that $L_{m+1} F(A)$ is the kernel of $F(M_m) \to F(P_m)$.
Conclude that if $P\to A$ is an $F\dash$acyclic resolution of $A$, then $L_i F(A) = H_i(F(P))$.
:::

:::{.problem title="Weibel 2.5.2"}
Show that the following are equivalent:

a. $A$ is a projective \(R\dash\)module.

b. $\Hom_R(\wait, A)$ is an exact functor.

c. $\Ext_R^{i\neq 0}(A, B) = 0$ and for all $B$, i.e. $A$ is $\Hom_R(\wait, B)\dash$acyclic for all $B$.

d. $\Ext_R^1(A, B)$ vanishes for all $B$.

:::

:::{.problem title="Weibel 2.6.4"}
Show that $\colim$ is left adjoint to $\Delta$, and conclude that $\colim$ is right-exact when when \( \cat{A} \) is abelian and $\colim$ exists.
Show that the pushout, i.e. $\bullet \leftarrow \bullet \rightarrow\bullet$, is not an exact functor on $\Ab$.

# Problem Set 6


:::{.problem title="5.7.1, Sentence One."}
In a Cartan-Eilenberg resolution, show that the following induced maps are projective resolutions in $\cat{A}$:

\[
\eps^p: P_{p, *} &\to A_p \\
Z^p(\eps): Z_p(P, d^h) &\to Z_p(A)
.\]

:::


:::{.problem title="5.7.2"}
If $A\to B$ is a chain map and $P\to A, Q\to B$ are CE resolutions, show that there is a double complex map $\tilde f: P \to Q$ lifting $f$.

:::{.problem title="5.7.3"}
\envlist

1. If $f, g:A\to B$ are homotopic maps of chain complex and $\tilde f, \tilde g:P\to Q$ are maps of CE resolutions over them, show that $\tilde f$ is chain homotopic to $\tilde g$.

2. Show that any two CE resolutions $P, Q$ of $A$ are chain homotopy equivalent.
  Conclude that for any additive functor $F$, the chain complex $\Totsum(F(P))$ and $\Totsum(F(Q))$ are chain homotopy equivalent.

Today: trying to prove acyclic assembly lemma
We reduced to proving one case, where $C$ is a double complex upper half-plane with exact columns $\implies \Tot^{\prod}(C)$ is acyclic.
It's enough to check in degree 0 by shifting.
Fix a 0-cycle $\vector c = (\cdots, c_{-j, j}, \cdots, c_{-2, 2}, c_{-1, 1}, c_{0, 0})$.
Find $b \in \prod_{j\jeq 0}C_{-j, j+1}$$ such that $d(b) = c$, so $c_{-j, j} = d^v(b_{-j, j+1}) + d^h(b_{-j+1, j})$.

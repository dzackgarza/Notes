Today: trying to prove acyclic assembly lemma


:::{.proof title="?"}
We reduced to proving one case, where $C$ is a double complex upper half-plane with exact columns $\implies \Tot^{\prod}(C)$ is acyclic.
It's enough to check in degree 0 by shifting.
Fix a 0-cycle $\vector c = (\cdots, c_{-j, j}, \cdots, c_{-2, 2}, c_{-1, 1}, c_{0, 0})$.
Find $b \in \prod_{j\jeq 0}C_{-j, j+1}$$ such that $d(b) = c$, so $c_{-j, j} = d^v(b_{-j, j+1}) + d^h(b_{-j+1, j})$. 
Construct by induction on $j$: set $b_{1, 0} = 0$ and need $c_{0, 0} = d^v(b_{0, 1})$. 
Since $d^vc_{0, 0} =0$ and the columns are exact, we can lift this to some $b_{0, 1}$ such that $d^v b_{0, 1} = c_{0, 0}$.
Inductively, we want $d^v(b_{-j, j+1} = c_{j, -j} - d^h(b_{-j+1, j})$.
Then
\[
d^v( c_{j, -j} - d^h b_{-j+1, j}) 
= d^v c_{j, -j} + d^h d^v b_{-j+1, j} \\
= d^v c_{j, -j} + d^h\qty{ c_{-j+1, j-1} - d^h b_{-j+2, j-1} ) \\
= d^v c_{j. -j} + d^h c_{-j+1, j-1} \\
= 0 \text{ since } d^{\prod} = 0
.\]
By exactness of column $j$, we can lift to $b_{-j, j+1}$, making $c$ a boundary.

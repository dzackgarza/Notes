## 3.6: Universal Coefficients Theorem

:::{.remark}
Let $X \in \Top$ and $S_k(X)$ be the free $\ZZ\dash$module on $\Hom(_\Top( \Delta_k, X)$, which assemble into a chain complex $S(X)$.
For $M\in \Ab$, we defined $H^n(X; M) \da H^n( \Hom(S(X), M))$ and write $H^n(X) \da H^n(X; \ZZ)$.
The universal coefficient theorem states
\[
H^n(X; M) \cong \Hom_\ZZ(H_n(X), M) \oplus \Ext^1_\ZZ( H_{n-1}(X), M)
.\]

Note that this is homology on the RHS, not cohomology!

:::{.theorem title="Universal Coefficients Theorem for Cohomology"}
Let $\complex{P}$ be a chain complex of projective \(R\dash\)modules.
Assume $dP_n$ is also projective for all $n$.
For $M\in \rmod$, there is a split SES
\[
0 \to \Ext_R^1(H_{n-1}(P), M) \to H^n( \Hom_R( \complex{P}, M)) \to \Hom_R (H_n(P), M) \to 0
.\]

:::{.proof title="Sketch"}
As in the last lecture with free abelian groups, since the $dP_n$ are projective we can split $P_n \cong Z_n \oplus dP_n$ since $Z_n = \ker d$.
Applying homs, since it's an additive functor this yields a new split exact sequence
\[
0 \to \Hom(dP_n, M) \to \Hom(P_n, M) \to \Hom(Z_n, M) \to 0
.\]
Now running the proof for the original Kunneth formula and replacing tensor products to homs, these assemble into a split exact sequence of complexes and this yields the desired SES.
Using the strategy of the proof of the UCF for free abelian groups to see that the sequence splits (although non-canonically).

:::{.remark}
Note that flat is weaker than projective for tensor products, but in an asymmetric situation, there's nothing weaker than projective for the hom functors to be exact (since this is an iff).

### Double Complexes

:::{.remark}
Consider a double complex:

\begin{tikzcd}
	&&&& {C_{p, \cdot}} \\
	\\
	&& {C_{p-1, q+1}} && {C_{p, q+1}} && {C_{p-1, q+1}} \\
	\\
	{C_{\cdot, q}} && {C_{p-1, q}} && {C_{p, q}} && {C_{p+1, q}} \\
	\\
	&& {C_{p-1, q+1}} && {C_{p-1, q+1}} && {C_{p-1, q+1}}
	\arrow["{d_{p, q}^h}", from=5-5, to=5-3]
	\arrow["{d_{p, q}^v}"', from=5-5, to=7-5]
	\arrow[from=3-5, to=5-5]
\end{tikzcd}

All of the individual rows and columns are chain complexes, where $(d^h)^2 = 0$ and $(d^v)^2 = 0$, and the square anticommute: $d^v d^h + d^h d^v - 0$, so $d^v d^h = -d^h d^v$.
This is almost a chain complex of chain complexes, i.e. an element of $\Ch(\Ch \rmod))$.
It's useful here to consider lines parallel to the line $y=x$.

:::

:::{.definition title="Bounded Complexes"}
A double complex $C_{\wait, \wait}$ is **bounded** if and only if there are only finitely many nonzero terms along each constant diagonal $p+q = n$.
:::

:::{.example title="?"}
A *first quadrant* double complex $\ts{C_{p, q}}_{p, q\geq 0}$ is bounded: note that this can still have infinitely many terms, but each diagonal is finite because each will hit a coordinate axis.
:::

:::{.remark title="The sign trick"}
The squares anticommute, since the $d^v$ are not chain maps between the horizontal chain complexes.
This can be fixed by changing every one out of four signs, defining
\[
f_{*, q}: C_{*, q} \to C_{*, q-1} \\
f_{p, q} \da (-1)^p d^v_{p, q}: C_{p,q} \to C_{p, q-1}
.\]

This yields a new double complex where the signs of each column alternate:

	{C_{0, q}} && {C_{1, q}} && {C_{2, q}} \\
	\\
	{C_{0, q-1}} && {C_{1, q-1}} && {C_{2, q-1}}
	\arrow["{d^v}", from=1-1, to=3-1]
	\arrow["{-d^v}", from=1-3, to=3-3]
	\arrow["{d^v}", from=1-5, to=3-5]
	\arrow["{d^h}"{description}, from=1-5, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{d^h}"{description}, from=1-3, to=1-1]
	\arrow["{d^h}"{description}, from=3-5, to=3-3]
	\arrow["{d^h}"{description}, from=3-3, to=3-1]
\end{tikzcd}

Now the squares commute and $f_{\wait, q}$ are chain maps, so this object is an element of $\Ch(\Ch \rmod)$.

### Total Complexes

Recall that products and coproducts of \(R\dash\)modules coincide when the indexing set is finite.

:::{.definition title="?"}
Given a double complex $C_{\wait, \wait}$, there are two ordinary chain complexes associated to it referred to as **total complexes**:
\[
\Tot^\prod (C)_n \da \prod_{p+q = n} C_{p, q}
\Tot^\oplus (C)_n \da \bigoplus_{p+q = n} C_{p, q}
.\]
Writing $\Tot(C)$ usually refers to the former.
The differentials are given by 
\[
d_{p, q} = d^h + d^v: C_{p, q} \to C_{p-1, q} \oplus C_{p, q-1}
,\]
where $C_{p, q} \subseteq \Tot^\oplus (C)_n$ and $C_{p-1, q} \oplus C_{p, q-1} \subseteq \Tot^\oplus(C)_{n-1}$.
Then you extend this to a differential on the entire diagonal by defining $d = \bigoplus d_{p, q}$.
:::

:::{.exercise title="?"}
Check that $d^2 = 0$, using $d^v d^h + d^h d^v = 0$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Some notes:

- $\Tot^\oplus(C) = \Tot^\prod(C)$ when $C$ is bounded.

- The total complexes need not exist if $C$ is unbounded: one needs infinite direct products and infinite coproducts to exist in \( \mathcal{C}  \).
  A category admitting these is called **complete** or **cocomplete**.[^dont_exist_ab_cat]

[^dont_exist_ab_cat]: 
Recall that abelian categories are additive and only require *finite* products/coproducts.
A counterexample: categories of *finite* abelian groups, where e.g. you can't take infinite sums and stay within the category.

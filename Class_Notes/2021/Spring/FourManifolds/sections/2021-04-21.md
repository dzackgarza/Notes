Why can't one blow down a curve $E\cong \CP^1$ with $E^2 = 1$ in a complex surface?
Disproof: consider $S\da \CP^2$ and $E$ a line, where $E^2 = 1$.
If there were a blowdown in the complex analytic category
\[
S &\to \bar{S} \\
E &\mapsto \pt
.\]
But $\bar{S} \cong_\Top S^4$, since $S^4 \# \CP^2 \cong \CP^2$, and this would yield a complex structure on $S^4$ -- a contradiction.
This also follows because $\bar{S} \in \QHS^4$, and Noether's formula implies that every $\QHS^4$ has no complex structure.

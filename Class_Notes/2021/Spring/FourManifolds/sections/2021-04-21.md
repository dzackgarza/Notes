Why can't one blow down a curve $E\cong \CP^1$ with $E^2 = 1$ in a complex surface?
Disproof: consider $S\da \CP^2$ and $E$ a line, where $E^2 = 1$.
If there were a blowdown in the complex analytic category
\[
S &\to \bar{S} \\
E &\mapsto \pt
.\]
But $\bar{S} \cong_\Top S^4$, since $S^4 \# \CP^2 \cong \CP^2$, and this would yield a complex structure on $S^4$ -- a contradiction.
This also follows because $\bar{S} \in \ZHS^4$, and Noether's formula implies that every $\ZHS^4$ has no complex structure.

Recall that we were considering the following:

\begin{tikzcd}
	& {\Bl_{p, q}\CP^2} \\
	\\
	{\CP^1 \cross \CP^2} && {\CP^2}
	\arrow["\sigma"', from=1-2, to=3-1]
	\arrow["\pi", from=1-2, to=3-3]
\end{tikzcd}

Let $\bar{\ell} \subset \Bl_{p, q}(\CP^2)$ the strict transform of a line through $p, q$ with $\hat{\ell}^2 = -1$.
Goal: we want to construct the map $\sigma$ sending $\hat{\ell}$ to a single point.
Let $r\in \Bl_{p, q}\CP^2$, then there are three possibilities:

1. $r\in \CP^2 \sm \ts{ p, q }$
2. $r\in E_p$
3. $r\in E_q$

If a point $r \neq p, q$, we can take lines $\ell_{pr}. \ell_{qr}$.
We can take slopes of these lines to get points in $\CP^1$, and in fact it's the exceptional divisor (since these are sets of slopes through a point).

So we can map
\[
r \mapsto 
\begin{cases}
( \slope_p \ell_{pr}, \slope_q \ell_{qr} ) \in \CP^2 \cross \CP^2
& \text{Case 1}
\\
(r, \slope_q \ell_{qp} ) 
& \text{Case 2}
\\
(\slope_p \ell_{pq}, r)
&\text{Case 3}
.
\end{cases}
.\]
This is clearly continuous, is this injective?
The outputs will be the same for any point on the line between $p$ and $q$:

\begin{tikzpicture}
\fontsize{45pt}{1em} 
\node (node_one) at (0,0) { \import{/home/zack/SparkleShare/github.com/Notes/Class_Notes/2021/Spring/FourManifolds/sections/figures}{2021-04-21_14-16.pdf_tex} };
\end{tikzpicture}

So this realizes the blowdown map, since $\Phi \hat{\ell}_{pq} ) = \pt$ and restricting it to  the complement of the line is injective.

Why can't one blow down a curve $E\cong \CP^1$ with $E^2 = 1$ in a complex surface?
Disproof: consider $S\da \CP^2$ and $E$ a line, where $E^2 = 1$.
If there were a blowdown in the complex analytic category
\[
S &\to \bar{S} \\
E &\mapsto \pt
.\]
But $\bar{S} \cong_\Top S^4$, since $S^4 \# \CP^2 \cong \CP^2$, and this would yield a complex structure on $S^4$ -- a contradiction.
This also follows because $\bar{S} \in \ZHS^4$, and Noether's formula implies that every $\ZHS^4$ has no complex structure.

Recall that 
\begin{tikzcd}
	& {\Bl_{p, q}\CP^2} \\
	\\
	{\CP^1 \cross \CP^2} && {\CP^2}
	\arrow["\sigma"', from=1-2, to=3-1]
	\arrow["\pi", from=1-2, to=3-3]
\end{tikzcd}

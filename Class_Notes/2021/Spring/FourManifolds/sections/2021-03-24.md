:::{.remark}
Last time: we defined a **Kahler manifold**: $X\in \Mfd(\CC)_\cpt$ and \( \omega \in \Omega^2(X_\RR) \) a closed real 2-form such that $g(x, y) \da \omega(x, Jy)$ is a metric.
By the Hodge theorem, we have a space \( \mch^k(X) \) of harmonic $k\dash$forms for $(X, g)$ which represents $H^k_{\dR}(X; \RR)$.
We can consider the $\CC\dash$valued harmonic forms \( \mch^k_\CC \da \mch^k(X) \tensor_\RR \CC \), which represents $H^k_\dR(X; \CC)$

:::{.question}
How does this interact with the decomposition of the smooth $k\dash$forms
\[
\Omega^k(X_\RR)\tensor_\RR \CC = \bigoplus_{p+q=k}^K A^{p, q}(X)
,\]
where $\mch^k_\CC(X)$ is contained in this.
Note that this is a small finite dimensional space in an infinite dimensional space!
The following miracle occurs:

:::{.theorem title="?"}
If $X \in \Mfd(\Kahler)$,
\[
\mch^k_\CC = \bigoplus_{p+q = k} \mch^{p, q}(X)
,\]
where 
\[
\mch^{p, q}(X) \da 
\qty{ \mch^K(X) \tensor_\RR \CC } \intersect A^{p, q}(X) \subseteq \Omega^k(X_\RR)
.\]

Let $X = \CC/ \Lambda$ be an elliptic curve where \( \Lambda \) is a lattice.
The standard metric $dx^2 + dy^2$ on $\CC$ descends to a metric on $X$ since translation is an isometry on the metric space $(\CC, dx^2 + dy^2)$.
Let $z=x+iy$ be a complex coordinate on $\CC$ so $dz = dx + idy$ and $d\bar z = dx - idy$, then \( dx^2 + dy^2 = dz d\bar{z} \in \Sym^2(T\CC) \).
The symplectic form is given by \( \omega(v, w) = \pm g(v, Jw) = i \dz \dzbar (v, w) \) since $J$ is given by $i$ on $\CC$.
Then \( \omega(v, w) = i \dz(v) \dzbar(w)\), i.e. \( \omega = i\dz \wedge \dzbar \).
So \( \bar{ \omega} = \bar i \dzbar \wedge \dz = -i \dzbar \wedge \dz = i\dz \dzbar = \omega \), and this determines the Kahler geometry on $X$.
What are the harmonic 1-forms on $X$, $\mch^1(X) \tensor_\RR \CC$?
Note that \( \omega= \dV \) is the volume form.
The smooth 1-forms are given by \( \Omega^1(X_\RR) \tensor_\RR \CC = A^{1, 0}(X) \oplus A^{0, 1}(X) = \ts{ f(z, \bar{z} )\dz } \oplus \ts{ g(z, \bar z)\dzbar}  \), where $f,g$ are smooth and \( \Lambda\dash \)periodic on $\CC$ to make them well-defined.
We can find the Hodge star:
\[
\hodgestar: ? &\to ? \\
\dz & \mapsto i\dzbar \\
\dzbar &\mapsto -i\dz
.\]
Writing \( \alpha\da f(z, \bar z)\dz + g(z, \bar z) \dzbar \), this is harmonic if \( d \alpha = 0 \) and \( \stardstar \alpha = 0 \).
The first implies \( \partial_{\bar z} f = - \partial_{z} g \).

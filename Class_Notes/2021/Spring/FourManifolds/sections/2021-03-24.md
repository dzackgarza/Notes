Last time: we defined a **Kahler manifold**: $X\in \Mfd(\CC)_\cpt$ and \( \omega \in \Omega^2(X_\RR) \) a closed real 2-form such that $g(x, y) \da \omega(x, Jy)$ is a metric.
By the Hodge theorem, we have a space \( \mch^k(X) \) of harmonic $k\dash$forms for $(X, g)$ which represents $H^k_{\dR}(X; \RR)$.
We can consider the $\CC\dash$valued harmonic forms \( \mch^k(X) \tensor_\RR \CC \), which represents $H^k_\dR(X; \CC)$

:::{.remark}
Last time: we defined a **Kahler manifold**: $X\in \Mfd(\CC)_\cpt$ and \( \omega \in \Omega^2(X_\RR) \) a closed real 2-form such that $g(x, y) \da \omega(x, Jy)$ is a metric.
By the Hodge theorem, we have a space \( \mch^k(X) \) of harmonic $k\dash$forms for $(X, g)$ which represents $H^k_{\dR}(X; \RR)$.
We can consider the $\CC\dash$valued harmonic forms \( \mch^k_\CC \da \mch^k(X) \tensor_\RR \CC \), which represents $H^k_\dR(X; \CC)$

:::{.question}
How does this interact with the decomposition of the smooth $k\dash$forms
\[
\Omega^k(X_\RR)\tensor_\RR \CC = \bigoplus_{p+q=k}^K A^{p, q}(X)
,\]
where $\mch^k_\CC(X)$ is contained in this.
Note that this is a small finite dimensional space in an infinite dimensional space!
The following miracle occurs:
:::


:::{.theorem title="?"}
If $X \in \Mfd(\Kahler)$,
\[
\mch^k_\CC = \bigoplus_{p+q = k} \mch^{p, q}(X)
,\]
where 
\[
\mch^{p, q}(X) \da 
\qty{ \mch^K(X) \tensor_\RR \CC } \intersect A^{p, q}(X)
.\]

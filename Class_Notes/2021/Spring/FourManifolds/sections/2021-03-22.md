:::{.remark}
Last time: we reviewed Riemann-Roch, Serre duality, sheaves of $p\dash$forms.
Recall a theorem from a few weeks ago:
:::


:::{.theorem title="The Hodge Theorem"}
If $(X,g)$ is a compact oriented Riemannian manifold, then there is a decomposition of the smooth $p\dash$forms on $X$:
\[
\Omega^p(X) = d \Omega^{p-1}(X) \oplus \mch^p(X) + d^\dagger \Omega^{p+1}(X)
,\]
where \( \mathcal{H}  \)  was the space of harmonic $p\dash$forms, and \( d^\dagger: \da (-1)^? \hodgestar d\hodgestar \) where
\[
\hodgestar: \Omega^{p}(X) &\to \Omega^{n-p}(X) \\
e_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_p} \mapsto \pm e_{j_1} \wedge \cdots e_{j_{n-p}}
\]
where \( \ts{ e_i}  \) is an orthonormal basis of basis of \( T\dual X \).

:::{.remark}
Note that this formula is replacing the $e_i$ that do appear with the $e_i$ that don't appear, up to a sign.

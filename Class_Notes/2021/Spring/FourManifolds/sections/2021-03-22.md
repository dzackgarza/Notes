:::{.remark}
Last time: we reviewed Riemann-Roch, Serre duality, sheaves of $p\dash$forms.
Recall a theorem from a few weeks ago:
:::


:::{.theorem title="The Hodge Theorem"}
If $(X,g)$ is a compact oriented Riemannian manifold, then there is a decomposition of the smooth $p\dash$forms on $X$:
\[
\Omega^p(X) = d \Omega^{p-1}(X) \oplus \mch^p(X) + d^\dagger \Omega^{p+1}(X)
.\]
:::


:::{.remark}
Note that \( \mathcal{H}  \)  was the space of harmonic $p\dash$forms, and \( d^\dagger: \da (-1)^? \hodgestar d\hodgestar \) where
\[
\hodgestar: \Omega^{p}(X) &\to \Omega^{n-p}(X) \\
e_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_p} \mapsto \pm e_{j_1} \wedge \cdots e_{j_{n-p}}
\]
where \( \ts{ e_i}  \) is an orthonormal basis of basis of \( T\dual X \).
Note that this formula is replacing the $e_i$ that do appear with the $e_i$ that don't appear, up to a sign.

The harmonic forms were defined as \( \mch^p(X) = \ker (dd^\dagger + d^\dagger d ) = \ker (d) \intersect \ker(d^\dagger) \).
We proved that assuming this decomposition, there is an isomorphism
\[
\mch^p(X) \cong H^p_{\dR}(X; \RR)
.\]

:::{.example title="The circle $S^1$"}
There's a standard flat metric $g_\std$ on $S^1$ where $g_\std = \dx^2$ with $x$ the coordinate on $\RR$ which is the universal cover of $S^1$.
We can write \( \Omega^1(S^1) = \ts{ f(x)\dx \st f \in C^{\infty }(S^1, \RR) } \), since every 1-form \( \omega \) looks like this.
Then \( d \omega = 0 \) since this is a 2-form on $S^1$.
On the other hand, what is $d^\dagger$?
$\hodgestar \omega$ is a 0-form, so a function.
The volume form is given by $\sqrt{ \det g_\std} = \sqrt{ [\dx ^2 ] }$, and you can wedge $1\wedge dx = dx$, so $\hodgestar \omega = f(x)$.
Then $d \hodgestar \omega = f'(x) \dx$ and \( d^\dagger x \omega = f'(x) \).
If this is zero, $f'(x) = 0$ and $f$ is a constant function.
So in this metric, \( \mch^1(S^1) = \RR \gens{ \dx }  \cong H^1(S^1; \RR) \).

:::{.remark title="Important"}
The harmonic forms \( \mch^p(X) \) depend on the metric $g$, despite mapping isomorphically to de Rham cohomology.
:::


:::{.remark}
This was just in the case of a real smooth Riemannian manifold.
What extra structure to we have for \( X \in \Mfd(\Hol(\wait, \CC) ) \)?

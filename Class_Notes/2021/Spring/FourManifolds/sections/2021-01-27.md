## Bundles and Connections

:::{.definition title="Connections"}
Let \( \mathcal{E}\to X  \) be a vector bundle, then a **connection** on \( \mathcal{E}  \) is a map of sheaves of abelian groups
\[
\nabla: \mathcal{E}\to \mathcal{E}\tensor \Omega^1_X  
\]
satisfying the *Leibniz rule*: \( \nabla (fs) = f \nabla s + s\tensor ds \) for all opens $U$ with $f\in \OO(U)$ and $s\in \mathcal{E}(U)$. 
Note that this works in the category of complex manifolds, in which case $\nabla$ is referred to as a **holomorphic connection**.

:::{.remark}
$\nabla$ induces a map 
\[
\tilde{\nabla}: \mathcal{E}\tensor \Omega^p \to \mathcal{E}\tensor \Omega^{p+1} \\
s \otimes \omega &\mapsto \nabla s \wedge w + s\tensor d \omega
.\]
where $\wedge: \Omega^p \tensor \Omega^1 \to \Omega^{p+1}$.
The standard example is
\[
d: \OO \to \Omega^1 \\
f &\mapsto df
.\]
where the induced map is the usual de Rham differential.

:::{.exercise title="?"}
Prove that the *curvature* of $\nabla$, i.e. the map
\[
F_{\nabla} \da \nabla \circ \nabla: \mathcal{E}\to \mathcal{E}\tensor \Omega^2  
\]
is $\OO\dash$linear, so $F_{\nabla}(fs) = f\nabla \circ \nabla(s)$.
Use the fact that $\nabla s \in \mathcal{E}\tensor \Omega^1$ and \( \omega \in \Omega^p \) and so \( \nabla s \otimes \omega \in \mathcal{E} \Omega^1 \otimes \Omega^p  \) and thus reassociating the tensor product yields $\nabla s \wedge \omega \in \mathcal{E}\tensor \Omega^{p+1}$.

Why is this called a connection?

\end{tikzpicture}

This gives us a way to transport $v\in \mathcal{E}_p$ over a path \( \gamma \) in the basis, and $\nabla$ provides a differential equation (a flow equation) to solve that lifts this path.
Solving this is referred to as **parallel transport**.
This works by pairing \( \gamma'(t) \in T_{ \gamma(t) } X \) with \( \Omega^1 \), yielding \( \nabla s = ( \gamma'(t)) = s( \gamma(t)) \) which are sections of \( \gamma \).

Note that taking a different path yields an endpoint in the same fiber but potentially at a different point, and $F_\nabla = 0$ if and only if the parallel transport from $p$ to $q$ depends only on the homotopy class of \( \gamma \).

> Note: this works for any bundle, so can become confusing in Riemannian geometry when all of the bundles taken are tangent bundles!

A classic example:
The Levi-Cevita connection $\nabla^{LC}$ on $TX$, which depends on a metric $g$.
Taking $X=S^2$ and $g$ is the round metric, there is nonzero curvature:

\begin{tikzpicture}
\fontsize{45pt}{1em} 
\node (node_one) at (0,0) { \import{/home/zack/SparkleShare/github.com/Notes/Class_Notes/2021/Spring/FourManifolds/sections/figures}{2021-01-27_14-15.pdf_tex} };
\end{tikzpicture}


In general, every such transport will be rotation by some vector, and the angle is given by the area of the enclosed region.

:::{.definition title="Flat Connection and Flat Sections"}
A connection is **flat** if $F_\nabla = 0$.
A section \( s \in \mathcal{E}(U)  \) is **flat** if it is given by $L(U) \da \ts{ s\in \mathcal{E}(U) \st \nabla s = 0}$. 
:::


:::{.exercise title="?"}
Show that if $\nabla$ is flat then $L$ is a *local system*: a sheaf that assigns to any sufficiently small open set a vector space of fixed dimension.
An example is the constant sheaf $\ul{\CC^d}$.
Furthermore $\rk(L) = \rk(\mathcal{E})$.

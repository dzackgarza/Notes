:::{.definition title="Connections"}
Let \( \mathcal{E}\to X  \) be a vector bundle, then a **connection** on \( \mathcal{E}  \) is a map of sheaves of abelian groups
\[
\nabla: \mathcal{E}\to \mathcal{E}\tensor \Omega^1_X  
\]
satisfying the *Leibniz rule*: \( \nabla (fs) = f \nabla s + s\tensor ds \) for all opens $U$ with $f\in \OO(U)$ and $s\in \mathcal{E}(U)$. 
:::


:::{.remark}
Note that this works in the category of complex manifolds, in which case $\nabla$ is referred to as a **holomorphic connection**.

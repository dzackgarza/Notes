Last time: the splitting principle.
Suppose we have \( \bundle{E} = L_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus L_r \) and let $x_i \da c_i(L_i)$.
Then $c_k(\bundle{E})$ is the degree $2k$ part of \( \prod_{i=1}^r (1 + x_i \) where each $x_i$ is in degree $2$.
This is equal to $e_k(x_1, \cdots, x_r)$ where $e_k$ is the $k$th elementary symmetric polynomial.
For example,

- $e_1 = x_1 + \cdots x_r$.

- $e_2 = x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + \cdots$

- $e_3 = \sum_{i<j<k} x_i x_j x_k$, etc.

The theorem is that any symmetric polynomial is a polynomial in the $e_i$.

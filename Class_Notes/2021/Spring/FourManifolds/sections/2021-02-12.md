Last time: the splitting principle.
Suppose we have \( \bundle{E} = L_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus L_r \) and let $x_i \da c_i(L_i)$.
Then $c_k(\bundle{E})$ is the degree $2k$ part of \( \prod_{i=1}^r (1 + x_i \) where each $x_i$ is in degree $2$.
This is equal to $e_k(x_1, \cdots, x_r)$ where $e_k$ is the $k$th elementary symmetric polynomial.

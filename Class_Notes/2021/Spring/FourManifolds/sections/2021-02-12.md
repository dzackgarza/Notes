Last time: the splitting principle.
Suppose we have \( \bundle{E} = L_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus L_r \) and let $x_i \da c_i(L_i)$.
Then $c_k(\bundle{E})$ is the degree $2k$ part of \( \prod_{i=1}^r (1 + x_i \) where each $x_i$ is in degree $2$.
This is equal to $e_k(x_1, \cdots, x_r)$ where $e_k$ is the $k$th elementary symmetric polynomial.
For example,

- $e_1 = x_1 + \cdots x_r$.

- $e_2 = x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + \cdots = \sum_{i < j} x_i x_j$

- $e_3 = \sum_{i<j<k} x_i x_j x_k$, etc.

The theorem is that any symmetric polynomial is a polynomial in the $e_i$.
For example, $p_2 = \sum x_i^2$ can be written as $e_1^2 - 2e_2$.
Similarly, $p_3 = \sum x_i^3 = e_1^3 - 3e_1 e_2 -3e_3$
Note that the coefficients of these polynomials are important for representations of $S_n$, see *Schur polynomials*.


:::{.remark}
Due to the splitting principle, we can pretend that $x_i = c_i(L_i)$ exists even when \( \bundle{E} \) doesn't split.
If \( \bundle{E} \to X \), the individual symbols $x_i$ don't exist, but we can write $x_1^3 + \cdots + x_r^3 = e_1^3 - 3e_1 e_2 - 3e_3 \da c_1(\bundle{E})^3 + 3c_1(\bundle{E}) c_2(\bundle{E}) + \cdots$, which is a well-defined element of $H^6(X; \ZZ)$.
So this polynomial defines a characteristic class of \( \bundle{E} \), and this can be done for any symmetric polynomial.
We can change basis in the space of symmetric polynomials to now define different characteristic classes.

The **Chern character** $\ch(\bundle{E}) \da \sum_{i=1}^r e^{x_i} \da \sum_{i=1}^r \sum_{k=0}^{\infty } {x_i^k \over k!} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty } {p_k(x_1, \cdots, x_r) \over k!}$.

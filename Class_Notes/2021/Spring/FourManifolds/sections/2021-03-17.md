Continuing review: let \( \bundle{E} \to X \in \Bun(\RR^n) \).
A **metric** on \( \bundle{E} \) is a smoothly varying positive definite inner product on the fibers.

For $v, w\in \bundle{E}_p$, we want a pairing \( g_p(v, w): \bundle{E}_p^{\tensor 2} \to \RR \).
To think about this globally, this should be a map
\[
g: \bundle{E}^{\tensor 2} \to \OO
.\]
where \( g_p: \bundle{E}_p^{\tensor 2} \to \RR \).
Note that this map is \( \OO\dash \)linear, which follows from the fact that it's $\RR\dash$linear on each fiber, or equivalently it is a map of vector bundles.
We should also have that $g(s\tensor s) \in \OO(X)$ is a smooth function, and we require $g(s\tensor s) \geq 0$.
We also require $g(s\tensor s)(p) = 0 \iff s_o = 0$ and $g(s\tensor t) = g(t\tensor s)$.
This makes $g\in (\bundle{E}^{\tensor 2})\dual \tensor \OO = (\bundle{E}\dual)^{\tensor 2}(X)$.
The symmetric condition means that $g\in \Sym^2 \bundle{E}\dual(X)$.

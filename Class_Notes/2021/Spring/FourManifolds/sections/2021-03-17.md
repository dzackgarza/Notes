Continuing review: let \( \bundle{E} \to X \in \Bun(\RR^n) \).
A **metric** on \( \bundle{E} \) is a smoothly varying positive definite inner product on the fibers.

\end{tikzpicture}

For $v, w\in \bundle{E}_p$, we want a pairing \( g_p(v, w): \bundle{E}_p^{\tensor 2} \to \RR \).
To think about this globally, this should be a map
\[
g: \bundle{E}^{\tensor 2} \to \OO
.\]
where \( g_p: \bundle{E}_p^{\tensor 2} \to \RR \).
Note that this map is \( \OO\dash \)linear, which follows from the fact that it's $\RR\dash$linear on each fiber.

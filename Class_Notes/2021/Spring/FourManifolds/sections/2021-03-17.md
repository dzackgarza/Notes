Continuing review: let \( \bundle{E} \to X \in \Bun(\RR^n) \).
A **metric** on \( \bundle{E} \) is a smoothly varying positive definite inner product on the fibers.

For $v, w\in \bundle{E}_p$, we want a pairing \( g_p(v, w): \bundle{E}_p^{\tensor 2} \to \RR \).
To think about this globally, this should be a map
\[
g: \bundle{E}^{\tensor 2} \to \OO
.\]
where \( g_p: \bundle{E}_p^{\tensor 2} \to \RR \).
Note that this map is \( \OO\dash \)linear, which follows from the fact that it's $\RR\dash$linear on each fiber, or equivalently it is a map of vector bundles.
We should also have that $g(s\tensor s) \in \OO(X)$ is a smooth function, and we require $g(s\tensor s) \geq 0$.
We also require $g(s\tensor s)(p) = 0 \iff s_o = 0$ and $g(s\tensor t) = g(t\tensor s)$.
This makes $g\in (\bundle{E}^{\tensor 2})\dual \tensor \OO = (\bundle{E}\dual)^{\tensor 2}(X)$.
The symmetric condition means that $g\in \Sym^2 \bundle{E}\dual(X)$.

For Hermitian forms, we take
\[
h: (\CC^n)^{\tensor 2}\to \CC
\]
where $h$ is conjugate linear, so $h(cv, c'w) = \bar{c}c' h(v, w)$.
Note that we can write $h(v, w) = \conjugate{v}^t H w$ where $H$ is Hermitian, so $\conjugate{H}^t = H$.
This implies that $h(v,v) \in \RR^{\geq 0}$ and $h(v,v) = 0 \iff v=0$ with $h(v, w) = \conjugate{h(v, w)}$
The great thing about metrics: we can identify zero sections by self-pairing, multiplying by a volume form, and integrating.
For \( \bundle{E}\to X \in \Bun(\CC) \), there is another bundle \( \conjugate{\bundle{E}} \to X \in \Bun(\CC) \).
Supposing that 
\( \ro{ \bundle{E}}{U} \mapsvia{\varphi_U} \OO_U^{\oplus n} \) 
in a local trivialization, conjugating all of the transition functions gives the transition functions
\( \ro{ \conjugate{ \bundle{E}} }{U} \mapsvia{\mathrm{conj} \circ \varphi_U} \OO_U^{\oplus n} \).
This yields a map
\[
h: \conjugate{ \bundle{E} } \tensor_\CC \bundle{E} \to \OO \in ( \conjugate{\bundle{E}} \tensor \bundle{E} )\dual
.\]
In local trivializations we have \( \ro{ \bundle{E} }{U} = \OO_U^{\oplus n} = \CC^n \cross U \), and $h$ is described by $h_U \in (\conj{ \OO}^{\oplus n} \tensor \OO^{\oplus n})(U)$.

When \( \rank \bundle{E} = 1 \) we abuse notation! 
For \( h\in (\conj{\bundle{E}}\dual \tensor \bundle{E}\dual)(X) \), this is locally a $1\times 1$ Hermitian matrix, thus of the form \( [a] \) for \( a\in \RR^{\geq 0} \).

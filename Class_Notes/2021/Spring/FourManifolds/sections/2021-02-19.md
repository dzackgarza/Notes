## Applications of Riemann-Roch


:::{.definition title="Curves"}
A **curve** is a compact complex manifold of complex dimension 1.
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
Let $C$ be a curve, then \( \Omega_C^1 \) is the sheaf of holomorphic 1-forms, and \( \Omega_C^{>1} = 0 \).
We also have the sheaves \( A^{1, 0}, A^{0, 1}, A^{1, 1}, \) the sheaves of smooth $(p, q)\dash$forms.
Here the only nonzero combinations are $(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)$ by dimensional considerations.
Let $L$ be a holomorphic line bundle on $C$, then \( \chi(C, L) = h^0(L) - h^1(L) = \deg(L) + 1 - g \).
:::


:::{.remark}
In general it can be hard to compute $h^1(L)$, since this is sheaf cohomology (sections over double overlaps, cocycle conditions, etc).
On the other hand, $h^0$ is easy to understand, since $h^0( \Omega^1_C)$ is the dimension of the global holomorphic sections $H^0(C, L) = L(C)$.
A key tool here is the following: 
:::


:::{.proposition title="Serre Duality"}
\[
H^1(C, L) \cong H^0(C, L ^{-1} \tensor \Omega_C^1)\dual
,\]
noting that these are both global sections of a line bundle.
:::


:::{.proof title="?"}
Recall that we had a resolution of the sheaf $L$ given by by smooth vector bundles:
\[
0 \to L \injects L\tensor A^{0, 0} \mapsvia{\delbar} L \tensor A^{0, 1} \mapsvia{\delbar} 0
.\]
So we know that $H^1(C, L) = H^0(L\tensor A^{0, 1}) / \delbar H^0(L\tensor A^{0, 0})$.

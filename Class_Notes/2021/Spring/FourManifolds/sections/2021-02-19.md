## Applications of Riemann-Roch


:::{.definition title="Curves"}
A **curve** is a compact complex manifold of complex dimension 1.

:::{.example title="?"}
The sheaf \( \Omega_C^1 \) is the sheaf of holomorphic 1-forms, and \( \Omega_C^{>1} = 0 \).
We also have the sheaves \( A^{1, 0}, A^{0, 1}, A^{1, 1}, \) the sheaves of smooth $(p, q)\dash$forms.
Here the only nonzero combinations are $(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)$ by dimensional considerations.
Let $L$ be a holomorphic line bundle on $C$.

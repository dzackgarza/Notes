Recall Serre duality: let $C\in \Mfd_\CC^{\cpt}$ and $L\to C \in \Bun(\Holo)$.
Then
\[
h^1(L) = h^0(L\dual \tensor K_C)
.\]
We also have Riemann-Roch, a very important tool:
\[
h^0(L) - h^1(L) = \deg L + 1 - g(C)
,\]
where $\deg L = \int_C c_1(L)$.
Note that $c_1$ is the most important Chern class to know, thanks to the splitting principle.
How was it defined?

1. $L$ defines an element of $H^1(C, \OO\units) = \ts{ t_{UV}: U \intersect V \to \CC\units \st t_{UV} t_{UW}\inv t_{VW} = 1 } / \bd \ts{ h_u: U\to \CC\units } = \ker \bd^1 / \im \bd^0$ in ÄŒech cohomology.
  By definition \( \bd \ts{ h_U \st U\in \mathcal{U} } = \ts{ h_u h_v\inv } U, V \in \mathcal{U} \), where $\bd^2 = 1$ since \( (h_U h_V)\inv \qty{h_U h_W \inv }\inv (h_V h_W \inv) = 1 \) on \( U \intersect V \intersect W \).
  By assigning $L$ to its transition functions, we get a map $L\to H^1$.
  We have the exponential exact sequence:
  \[
  0 \to \constantsheaf{\ZZ} \to \OO \mapsvia{\exp} \OO\units \to 1
  .\]

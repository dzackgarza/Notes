Recall Serre duality: let $C\in \Mfd_\CC^{\cpt}$ and $L\to C \in \Bun(\Holo)$.
Then
\[
h^1(L) = h^0(L\dual \tensor K_C)
.\]
We also have Riemann-Roch, a very important tool:
\[
h^0(L) - h^1(L) = \deg L + 1 - g(C)
,\]
where $\deg L = \int_C c_1(L)$.
Note that $c_1$ is the most important Chern class to know, thanks to the splitting principle.
How was it defined?

1. $L$ defines an element of $H^1(C, \OO\units) = \ts{ t_{UV}: U \intersect V \to \CC\units \st t_{UV} t_{UW}\inv t_{VW} = 1 } / \bd \ts{ h_u: U\to \CC\units }$

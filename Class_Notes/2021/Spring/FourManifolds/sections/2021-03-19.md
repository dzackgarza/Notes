Recall Serre duality: let $C\in \Mfd_\CC^{\cpt,\oriented}$ and $L\to C \in \Bun(\Holo)$.
Then
\[
h^1(L) = h^0(L\dual \tensor K_C)
.\]
We also have Riemann-Roch, a very important tool:
\[
h^0(L) - h^1(L) = \deg L + 1 - g(C)
,\]
where $\deg L = \int_C c_1(L)$, which is also equal to \( \deg [ \ts{ s = 0 }]  = \deg(\div s) \).
Note that $c_1$ is the most important Chern class to know, thanks to the splitting principle.
How was it defined?
There are several definitions:

1. $L$ defines an element of $H^1(C, \OO\units) = \ts{ t_{UV}: U \intersect V \to \CC\units \st t_{UV} t_{UW}\inv t_{VW} = 1 } / \bd \ts{ h_u: U\to \CC\units } = \ker \bd^1 / \im \bd^0$ in ÄŒech cohomology.
  By definition \( \bd \ts{ h_U \st U\in \mathcal{U} } = \ts{ h_u h_v\inv } U, V \in \mathcal{U} \), where $\bd^2 = 1$ since \( (h_U h_V)\inv \qty{h_U h_W \inv }\inv (h_V h_W \inv) = 1 \) on \( U \intersect V \intersect W \).
  By assigning $L$ to its transition functions, we get a map $L\to H^1$.
  We have the exponential exact sequence:
  \[
  0 \to \constantsheaf{\ZZ} \to \OO \mapsvia{\exp} \OO\units \to 1
  ,\]
  which induces a map
  \[
  H^1(C, \OO\units) &\to H^2(C, \ZZ) \\
  L &\mapsto c_1(L)
  .\]

2. $L$ defines an element $\Fr L \in \Bun^\prin(\CC\units)$ (which only works for line bundles), which is defined by \( \Fr L = L \sm s_0 \)  where $s_0$ is the zero section of $L$.
  By topology, we get a classifying map $C \mapsvia{\phi_L}  B\CC\units = \CP^\infty = (\CC^{\infty} \smz) / \CC\units$.
  There is a universal $c_1\in H^2(\CP^{\infty}; \ZZ)$, so we take the pullback to define $c_1(L) \da \phi_L^*(c_1)$.
  We can use that there is a cell decomposition \( \CP^{\infty } = \CC^0 \union \CC^1 \union \CC^2 \union \cdots \), and so there is a unique generator in its $H^2$.

3. Consider a smooth section $s\in C^{\infty }(L)$, then we can define $c_1(L) \da [ \ts{ s = 0 } ]$ by taking the fundamental class, assuming that $s$ is transverse to the zero section $s_z$ of $L$.
  Here we view the zero set as an oriented submanifold.
  See picture: in this case $[\ts{ s = 0 } ] = [p] - [q] + [r]$.

The left-hand side in Serre duality is the dimension of the space of holomorphic sections of some *other* bundle, $L\dual \tensor K$.

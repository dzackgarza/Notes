Find first 5m.

When we considered $\bar{\CP}^2$, we implicitly assumed $T\bar{\CP}^2$ was a complex rank 2 vector bundle with some purported complex structure.


:::{.claim}
\[
c_1( T\bar{\CP}^2) = \pm 3H
,\]
although it's not clear that $c_1(K) \in H^2( \bar{\CP}^2; \ZZ) \cong (\ZZ, [-1] )$.

:::{.remark}
We had \( \chi(\OO) = {1\over 12} \qty{ K^2 + \chi_\Top} = {1\over 12}(3-n^2) \), and since $3-n^2 \in 12\ZZ$, we have $n^2 \in 3 + 12\ZZ \subset 3 + 4\ZZ$ and this forces $n^2 \equiv 3 \mod 4$.

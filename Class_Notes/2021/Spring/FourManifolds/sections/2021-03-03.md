Find first 5m.

When we considered $\bar{\CP}^2$, we implicitly assumed $T\bar{\CP}^2$ was a complex rank 2 vector bundle with some purported complex structure.


:::{.claim}
\[
c_1( T\bar{\CP}^2) = \pm 3H
,\]
although it's not clear that $c_1(K) \in H^2( \bar{\CP}^2; \ZZ) \cong (\ZZ, [-1] )$.

:::{.remark}
We had \( \chi(\OO) = {1\over 12} \qty{ K^2 + \chi_\Top} = {1\over 12}(3-n^2) \), and since $3-n^2 \in 12\ZZ$, we have $n^2 \in 3 + 12\ZZ \subset 3 + 4\ZZ$ and this forces $n^2 \equiv 3 \mod 4$.

:::{.definition title="Elliptic Complex"}
Let 
\[
0 \to \bundle{E}^0 \mapsvia{d_0} \bundle{E}^1 \mapsvia{d_1} \cdots \to \bundle{E}^n \to 0
\]
be a complex (so $d^2 = 0$) of smooth vector bundles on a smooth manifold $X\im \Mfd_\RR^{C^\infty}$.
Suppose that the $d_i$ are **differential operators**, i.e. in local trivializing charts over $U$ we have 

\[
\bundle{E}^i \cong \OO^{\oplus r_i} \OO^{\oplus r_{i+1}} \cong \bundle{E}^{i+1}
\]
where in every matrix coordinate, $d_i$ is of the form $\sum_{\abs I < N} g_I \bd_I$ where $\bd_I \da \bd_{i_1} \cdots \bd_{i_N}$ is a partial derived and the $g_I$ are smooth functions.

:::{.example title="?"}
For $X\in \Mfd_\RR^{C^ \infty }$, we can take 
\[
0 \to \OO \mapsvia{d} \Omega^1 \mapsvia{d} \Omega^2 \mapsvia{d} \cdots
.\]
In local coordinates, 

- \( \Omega^1 \) is spanned over $\OO$ by $dx_1, \cdots, dx_n$ where $n = \dim_\RR(X)$
- \( \Omega^2 \) is spanned over $\OO$ by $dx_i \wedge dx_j$ for $1\leq i, j \leq n$.

Find first 5m.


:::{.remark}
When we considered $\bar{\CP}^2$, we implicitly assumed $T\bar{\CP}^2$ was a complex rank 2 vector bundle with some purported complex structure.

:::{.claim}
\[
c_1( T\bar{\CP}^2) = \pm 3H
,\]
although it's not clear that $c_1(K) \in H^2( \bar{\CP}^2; \ZZ) \cong (\ZZ, [-1] )$.
:::

:::{.remark}
We had \( \chi(\OO) = {1\over 12} \qty{ K^2 + \chi_\Top} = {1\over 12}(3-n^2) \), and since $3-n^2 \in 12\ZZ$, we have $n^2 \in 3 + 12\ZZ \subset 3 + 4\ZZ$ and this forces $n^2 \equiv 3 \mod 4$.

:::{.definition title="Differential Complex"}
Let 
\[
0 \to \bundle{E}^0 \mapsvia{d_0} \bundle{E}^1 \mapsvia{d_1} \cdots \to \bundle{E}^n \to 0
\]
be a complex (so $d^2 = 0$) of smooth vector bundles on a smooth manifold $X\im \Mfd_\RR^{C^\infty}$.
Suppose that the $d_i$ are **differential operators**, i.e. in local trivializing charts over $U$ we have 

\[
\bundle{E}^i \cong \OO^{\oplus r_i} \OO^{\oplus r_{i+1}} \cong \bundle{E}^{i+1}
\]
where in every matrix coordinate, $d_i$ is of the form $\sum_{\abs I < N} g_I \bd_I$ where $\bd_I \da \bd_{i_1} \cdots \bd_{i_N}$ is a partial derived and the $g_I$ are smooth functions.
:::

:::{.example title="?"}
For $X\in \Mfd_\RR^{C^ \infty }$, we can take 
\[
0 \to \OO \mapsvia{d} \Omega^1 \mapsvia{d} \Omega^2 \mapsvia{d} \cdots
.\]
In local coordinates, 

- \( \Omega^1 \) is spanned over $\OO$ by $dx_1, \cdots, dx_n$ where $n = \dim_\RR(X)$
- \( \Omega^2 \) is spanned over $\OO$ by $dx_i \wedge dx_j$ for $1\leq i, j \leq n$.

Then the component of $d$ sending $dx_i \to dx_i \wedge dx_j$ is of the form
\[
fdx_i &\mapsto -\dd{f}{x_j} dx_i \wedge dx_j
.\]
:::

:::{.example title="?"}
For $X\in \Mfd_\CC$ and \( \bundle{E} \to X \) a holomorphic vector bundle, take
\[
\bundle{E} \tensor A^{0,0} \mapsvia{\delbar} \bundle{E} \tensor A^{0, 1} \mapsvia{\delbar} \bundle{E} \tensor A^{0, 2} \to \cdots
.\]
This is because for $s_i$ local holomorphic sections and $\omega$ a smooth form we have
\[
\delbar \qty{ (s_1, \cdots, s_r) \tensor \omega } = \qty{s_1, \cdots, s_r} \tensor \delbar \omega
.\]


:::

:::{.definition title="Order of an operator"}
The maximal $N$ that appears in $\sum_{ \abs I \leq N} g_I \bd_I$ is the **order**.
:::

:::{.definition title="Symbol Complex"}
The **symbol complex** is a sequence of vector bundles on $T\dual X$.
Noting that we have $\pi: T\dual X\to X$, and using pullbacks we can obtain bundles over the cotangent bundle:
\[
0 \to \pi^* \bundle{E}_0 \mapsvia{\sigma(d_0)} \pi^* \bundle{E}_1 \mapsvia{\sigma(d_1)} \cdots \to \pi^* \bundle{E}_n \to 0
.\]
The **symbol** of the differential operator $d_i$ is $\sigma(d_i)$.
It is defined by replacing $\del_i$ in $\sum g_I \del_I$ with $y_i$ where
\[
y_i: T\dual U \to \RR
\]
is the coordinate function on the second factor of $T\dual U = U \cross \RR^n$ associated to the local coordinate $i$.

# Principal $G\dash$Bundles and Connections (Monday, January 25)



:::{.definition title="Principal Bundles"}
Let $G$ be a (possibly disconnected) Lie group.
Then a **principal $G\dash$bundle** $\pi:P\to X$ is a space admitting local trivializations $h_u: \pi ^{-1} (U) \to G \cross U$ such that the transition functions are given by left multiplication by a continuous function $t_{UV}: U \intersect V \to G$.

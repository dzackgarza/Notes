# Principal $G\dash$Bundles and Connections (Monday, January 25)



:::{.definition title="Principal Bundles"}
Let $G$ be a (possibly disconnected) Lie group.
Then a **principal $G\dash$bundle** $\pi:P\to X$ is a space admitting local trivializations $h_u: \pi ^{-1} (U) \to G \cross U$ such that the transition functions are given by left multiplication by a continuous function $t_{UV}: U \intersect V \to G$.

Consider $TX$ for $X\in \Mfd_\Sm$, and let $g$ be a metric on the tangent bundle given by $g_p: T_pX^{\tensor 2} \to \RR$, a symmetric bilinear form with $g_p(u, v) \geq 0$ with equality if and only if $v=0$.


:::{.definition title="The Frame Bundle"}
Define $\Frame_p(X) \da \ts{\text{bases of } T_p X}$, and $\Frame X \da \Union_{p\in X} \Frame_p X$.
:::


:::{.remark}
More generally, $\Frame \mathcal{E}$ can be defined for any vector bundle \( \mathcal{E} \), so $\Frame X \da \Frame TX$.
Note that $\Frame X$ is a principal $\GL_n(\RR)\dash$bundle where $n\da \rank(\mathcal{E})$.
This follows from the fact that the transition functions are fiberwise in $\GL_n(\RR)$, so the transition functions are given by left-multiplication by matrices.
:::


:::{.remark title="Important"}
A principal $G\dash$bundle admits a $G\dash$action where $G$ acts by *right* multiplication:
\[
P \cross G \to P \\
( (g, x), h) \mapsto (gh, x)
.\]
This is necessary for compatibility on overlaps.
**Key point**: the actions of left and right multiplication commute.
:::


:::{.definition title="Orthogonal Frame Bundle"}
The **orthogonal frame bundle** of a vector bundle \( \mathcal{E}  \) equipped with a metric $g$ is defined as $\OFrame_p \mathcal{E}\da \ts{\text{orthonormal bases of } \mathcal{E}_p}$, also written $O_r(\RR)$ where $r \da \rank( \mathcal{E})$. 
:::


:::{.remark}
The fibers $P_x \to \ts {x}$ of a principal $G\dash$bundle are naturally **torsors** over $G$, i.e. a set with a free transitive $G\dash$action.
:::


:::{.definition title="?"}
Let \( \mathcal{E}\to X  \) be a complex vector bundle.
Then a **hermitian metric** is a hermitian form on every fiber, i.e. $h_p: \mathcal{E}_p \cross \bar{\mathcal{E}_p } \to \CC$ where $h_p(v, \bar v) \geq 0$ with equality if and only if $v=0$.
Here we define \( \bar \mathcal{E}_p  \) as the fiber of the complex vector bundle \( \bar \mathcal{E}  \) whose transition functions are given by the complex conjugates of those from \( \mathcal{E}  \).
:::


:::{.remark}
Note that \( \mathcal{E}, \bar\mathcal{E}   \) are genuinely different as complex bundles.
There is a *conjugate-linear* map given by conjugation, i.e. $L(cv) = \bar c L(v)$, where the canonical example is 
\[
\CC^n &\to \CC^n \\
(z_1, \cdots, z_n) &\mapsto (\bar z_1, \cdots, \bar z_n)
.\]

:::


:::{.definition title="Unitary Frame Bundle"}
We define the **unitary frame bundle** $\UFrame(\mathcal{E}) \da \Union_p \UFrame(\mathcal{E})_p$, where at each point this is given by the set of orthogonal frames of \( \mathcal{E}_p  \) given by $(e_1, \cdots, e_n)$ where $h(e_i , \bar e_j) = \delta_{ij}$.
:::


:::{.remark}
This is a principal $G\dash$bundle for $G = U_r(\CC)$, the invertible matrices $A_{/\CC}$ satisfy $A \bar{A}^t = \id$.
:::


:::{.example title="of more principal bundles"}
For $G=\ZZ/2\ZZ$ and $X= S^1$, the Mobius band is a principal $G\dash$bundle:

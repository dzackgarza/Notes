Last time: Riemann-Roch for surfaces, today we'll discuss some examples.
Recall that if $S \in \Mfd_\CC^2$ is closed and compact (noting that $S\in \Mfd_\RR^4$) and $L\to S$ is a holomorphic line bundle then
\[
\chi(S, L) = \chi(\OO_S) + {1\over 2}(L^2 - L \cdot K)
\]
where $K = c_1(K_S)$ for $K_S \da \Omega_S^2$ the canonical bundle and $L = c_1(L)$.
We also saw
\[
\chi(\OO_S) = {1\over 12}(K^2 + \chi_{\Top}(S))
,\]
where $\chi_\Top$ is the Euler characteristic and is given by 
\[
\chi_\Top(S) = 2 h^0(S; \CC) - 2 h^1(S, \CC) + h^2(S; \CC)
.\]

Recall that given a differential complex \( (\complex{ \bundle{E} }, d) \) we had a symbol complex \( ( \pi^* \complex{\bundle{E}}, \sigma(d) \) where $\pi: T\dual X\to X$ and \( \sigma( \sum_{\abs{I} \leq N} f_I \bd_I = \sum_{\abs{I} = N} f_I y^I \), where $\dd{}{x_j} \mapsto y_j$ and 
\[
T\dual X &\to \RR \\
\alpha &\mapsto \alpha( \dd{}{x_j} )
.\]
We say that \( ( \complex{\bundle{E} }, d ) \) is **elliptic** if the symbol complex is exact on $T\dual X \smz$ where we delete the zero section.
The Atiyah-Singer index theorem stated
\[
\chi( \complex{\bundle{E}}, d) = \int_X { \ch( \

Recall that given a differential complex \( (\complex{ \bundle{E} }, d) \) we had a symbol complex \( ( \pi^* \complex{\bundle{E}}, \sigma(d) \) where $\pi: T\dual X\to X$ and \( \sigma( \sum_{\abs{I} \leq N} f_I \bd_I = \sum_{\abs{I} = N} f_I y^I \), where we take the top-order differentials, $\dd{}{x_j} \mapsto y_j$ and 
\[
T\dual X &\to \RR \\
\alpha &\mapsto \alpha( \dd{}{x_j} )
.\]
We say that \( ( \complex{\bundle{E} }, d ) \) is **elliptic** if the symbol complex is exact on $T\dual X \smz$ where we delete the zero section.
The Atiyah-Singer index theorem stated
\[
\chi( \complex{\bundle{E}}, d) = \int_X { \ch( \complex{ \bundle{E} } \over \eul(X) } \td( TX\tensor_\RR \CC)
.\]
What's the connection to elliptic operators?
Given a 2-term complex 
\[
0 \to \bundle{E}^0 \mapsvia{D} \bundle{E}^1 \to 0
,\]
then $D$ is an **elliptic operator** if this is an elliptic complex.
This means the symbol complex is an isomorphism, i.e. 
\[
0 \to \pi^* \bundle{E}^0 \mapsvia{\sigma(D)} \pi^* \bundle{E}^1 \to 0
\]
where $\sigma(D)$ is an isomorphism away from the zero section.

Every elliptic complex can be converted into a 2-term complex using a hermitian metric.

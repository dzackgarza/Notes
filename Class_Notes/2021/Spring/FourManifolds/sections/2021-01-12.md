## Background

Further Reading: There are very few references in the notes, and I'll try to update them to include more as we go. Personally, I found the following online references particularly useful: 

Dietmar Salamon: Spin Geometry and Seiberg-Witten Invariants
https://people.math.ethz.ch/~salamon/PREPRINTS/witsei.pdf

Richard Mandelbaum: Four-dimensional Topology: An Introduction
https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.bams/1183545202

This book has a nice introduction to surgery aspects of four-manifolds, but as a warning: It was published right before Freedman's famous theorem. For instance, the existence of an exotic R^4 was not known. This actually makes it quite useful, as a summary of what was known before, and provides the historical context in which Freedman's theorem was proven.

## Introduction

Recall that a **topological manifold** (or $C^0$ manifold) $X$ is a Hausdorff topological space *locally homeomorphic* to $\RR^n$ with a countable topological base, so we have charts $\phi_u: U\to \RR^n$ which are homeomorphisms from open sets covering $X$.

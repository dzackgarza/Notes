Last time: the Hodge decomposition theorem.
Let $(X, g) \in \Mfd_\CC^\cpt(\Kah)$, then the space of harmonic $k\dash$forms \( \mathcal{H}^k(X)  \tensor_\RR \CC \) decomposes as \( \bigoplus_{p+q = k} \mathcal{H}^{p, q}(X)  \).
There is also a symmetry \( \bar{\mathcal{H}^{p, q}(X) } = \mathcal{H}^{q, p}(X) \).
We have an isomorphism to the de Rham cohomology \( \mathcal{H}^k(X) \tensor_\RR \CC \cong H^k_\dR (X; \CC)  \).
We know the constituent pieces as well: \( \mathcal{H}^{p, q}(X) = \ker (\Delta_d: A^{p, q}(X) \selfmap)  \), where we had relationships \( \Delta_{\delbar} = \delbar \delbar^\dagger + \delbar^\dagger \delbar \) and \( \Delta_d = 2 \Delta_{\delbar} \).
There was a proposition that \( \ker(\Delta_d) = \ker(d) \intersect \ker(d^\dagger) \), and the same proposition holds for \( \Delta_{\delbar} \).
In this case we have \( \ker(\Delta_{\delbar}) = \ker(\delbar) \intersect \ker( \delbar^\dagger) \) on $A^{p, q}(X)$, and this is isomorphic to \( \ker(\delbar) / \im(\delbar) \).
Recall that we resolved the sheaf \( \Omega^p \) of holomorphic $p\dash$forms by taking the Dolbeault resolution
\[
0 \to \Omega^p \to A^{p, 0} \mapsvia{\delbar} A^{p, 1} \mapsvia{\delbar} A^{p, 2} \to \cdots
.\]
Thus we can identify \( \ker(\delbar)/\im(\delbar) \cong \Hsh( X; \Omega^p) \) as sheaf cohomology.
We defined \( h^{p, q}(X) \da \dim_\CC H^{p, q}(X) \).

:::{.corollary title="?"}
$h^{p,q }(X)$ is independent of the Kähler form, noting that the isomorphism to sheaf cohomology doesn't involve taking adjoints, 
and $\dim_\CC \Hsh^q(X; \Omega^p)$ doesn't depend on the complex structure.
:::


:::{.remark}
A priori, one could vary the Kahler form and have some $h^{p, q}$ jump or drop dimension.
It also turns out that varying the complex structure will also not change these dimensions.

:::{.remark}
Whenever the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence degenerates, one generally gets $\sum_{p+q} h^{p,q } = h^k$.
Note that there is a resolution:
\[
0 \to \constantsheaf{\CC} \to \OO \mapsvia{d} \Omega^1 \mapsvia{d} \Omega^2 \mapsvia{d} \cdots
,\]
which is not acyclic and thus has homology.
In general, the spectral sequence is 
\[
E^1_{p,q} = H^q(X; \Omega^p) \abuts H^{p+q}(X; \constantsheaf{\CC})
.\]

:::{.fact}
A fact about the cohomology of vector bundles: given a family of Kähler manifolds $X_t$, one can consider \( H^q(X_t; \bundle{E}_t \) where \( \bundle{E}_t \) is a family of holomorphic vector bundles. 
This can only jump upward in dimension, i.e. $\dim_\CC H^q(X_t; \bundle{E}_t)$ is *lower semicontinuous*.
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
Consider
\[
X_t \da \ts{ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + txyz = 0 } \subseteq \CP^2
,\]
where $t$ varies in $\CC$.
These all admit a line bundle \( \bundle{L}_t \da \ro{ \OO(1) } {X_t} \), the anti-tautological line bundle on $\PP^2$.

The real points of this vanishing locus form an elliptic curve, and each $X_t$ is a Riemann surface of genus 1.
Note that $h^{0, 1}$ can jump on closed sets, but $H^1$ is constant since Riemann-Roch involves genus and degree.
What is $\deg \ro {\OO(1)}{X_t}$?
Take a section $s \in H^0(\PP^2; \OO(1))$ which vanishes on a line in $\PP^2$.

Last time: the Hodge decomposition theorem.
Let $(X, g) \in \Mfd_\CC^\cpt(\Kah)$, then the space of harmonic $k\dash$forms \( \mathcal{H}^k(X)  \tensor_\RR \CC \) decomposes as \( \bigoplus_{p+q = k} \mathcal{H}^{p, q}(X)  \).
There is also a symmetry \( \bar{\mathcal{H}^{p, q}(X) } = \mathcal{H}^{q, p}(X) \).
We have an isomorphism to the de Rham cohomology \( \mathcal{H}^k(X) \tensor_\RR \CC \cong H^k_\dR (X; \CC)  \).
We know the constituent pieces as well: \( \mathcal{H}^{p, q}(X) = \ker (\Delta_d: A^{p, q}(X) \selfmap)  \), where we had relationships \( \Delta_{\delbar} = \delbar \delbar^\dagger + \delbar^\dagger \delbar \) and \( \Delta_d = 2 \Delta_{\delbar} \).
There was a proposition that \( \ker(\Delta_d) = \ker(d) \intersect \ker(d^\dagger) \), and the same proposition holds for \( \Delta_{\delbar} \).

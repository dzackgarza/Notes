# Sheaf Cohomology (Friday, January 29)

Last time: we defined the ÄŒech complex $C_{\mathfrak{U} }^p(X, \mathcal{F} ) \da \prod_{i_1, \cdots, i_p} \mathcal{F} (U_{i_1} \intersect \cdots \intersect U_{i_p})$ for \( \mathfrak{U}\da \ts{U_i}  \) is an open cover of $X$ and $F$ is a sheaf of abelian groups.

:::{.fact}
If \( \mathfrak{U}  \) is a sufficiently fine cover then $H^p_{\mathfrak{U}}(X, \mathcal{F})$ is independent of \( \mathfrak{U}  \), and we call this $H^p(X; \mathcal{F})$. 
:::

:::{.remark}
Recall that we computed \( H^p(S^1, \ul{\ZZ} = [\ZZ, \ZZ, 0, \cdots] \).
:::

:::{.theorem title="?"}
Let $X$ be a paracompact and locally contractible topological space.
Then $H^p(X, \ul{\ZZ}) \cong H^p_{\sing}(X, \ul{\ZZ})$.
This will also hold more generally with $\ul{\ZZ}$ replaced by $\ul{A}$ for any $A\in \Ab$.
:::


:::{.definition title="Acyclic Sheaves"}
We say \( \mathcal{F}  \) is *acyclic* on $X$ if $H^{> 0 }(X; \mathcal{F}) = 0$

Last time: we defined $\Pic(\CP^n)$ as the set of line bundles on $\CP^n$.

:::{.definition title="Picard Group of a Manifold"}
Given any $X\in \Mfd_\CC$, define $\Pic(X)$ as the set of isomorphism classes of holomorphic line bundles on $X$.
This is an abelian group given by $L \tensor L'$ and inversion $L\to L\inv$.

We saw that $\Pic(X) \cong H^1(X; \OO\units)$ as groups, noting that $H^1$ has a natural group structure here.
We defined a **tautological bundle** on $\CP^n$ and saw it was isomorphic to $\OO(-1)$, and moreover $\OO(H) \cong \OO(1)$ for $H$ a hyperplane.
The fiber was given by 
\[
\mathrm{Taut} &\to \CP^n \\
\ts{ \lambda (x_0, \cdots, x_n) \st \lambda\in \CC } &\mapsto [x_0: \cdots : x_n]
,\]
i.e. the entire line corresponding to the given projective point.
We also have $\OO(H)(U)$ is the sect of rational homogeneous functions $\phi$ on $U$ of degree 1 such that $\Div \phi + H \geq 0$ where $H \da \ts{x_0 = 0}$.
We want $\phi/x_0$ to be a well-defined function, so $\phi$ should scale like $x_0$ in the sense that 
\[
\phi( \lambda x_0, \cdots, \lambda x_n) = \lambda\phi( x_0, \cdots, x_n)
.\]
Note that there is a natural map
\[
\Taut \tensor \OO(H) \mapsvia{} \OO
,\]
given by taking the line over a point and evaluating the homogeneous function on that line.
Thus $\Taut$ is the inverse of $\OO(H)$.

:::{.remark}
We want to understand what Noether's formula says for $\CP^2$, which requires understanding the canonical bundle $K_{\CP^n}$.
We'll do this by writing down a meromorphic section \( \omega \) (since it's a meromorphic volume form) which will yield $\K(_{\CP^n}) = \OO(\Div \omega)$.
So take
\[
\omega \da \dd{x_1}{x_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \dd{x_n}{x_n} 
,\]
noting that we leave out the first coordinate $x_0$.
Why is this well-defined on $\CP^n$?

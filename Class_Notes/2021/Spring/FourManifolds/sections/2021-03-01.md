Last time: we defined $\Pic(\CP^n)$ as the set of line bundles on $\CP^n$.

:::{.definition title="Picard Group of a Manifold"}
Given any $X\in \Mfd_\CC$, define $\Pic(X)$ as the set of isomorphism classes of holomorphic line bundles on $X$.
This is an abelian group given by $L \tensor L'$ and inversion $L\to L\inv$.

:::{.remark}
We saw that $\Pic(X) \cong H^1(X; \OO\units)$ as groups, noting that $H^1$ has a natural group structure here.
We defined a **tautological bundle** on $\CP^n$ and saw it was isomorphic to $\OO(-1)$, and moreover $\OO(H) \cong \OO(1)$ for $H$ a hyperplane.
The fiber was given by 
\[
\mathrm{Taut} &\to \CP^n \\
\ts{ \lambda (x_0, \cdots, x_n) \st \lambda\in \CC } &\mapsto [x_0: \cdots : x_n]
,\]
i.e. the entire line corresponding to the given projective point.
We also have $\OO(H)(U)$ is the sect of rational functions $\phi$ on $U$ such that $\Div \phi + H \geq 0$ with $H \da \ts{x_0 = 0}$.

:::{.remark}
Last time: we defined $\Pic(\CP^n)$ as the set of line bundles on $\CP^n$.

:::{.definition title="Picard Group of a Manifold"}
Given any $X\in \Mfd_\CC$, define $\Pic(X)$ as the set of isomorphism classes of holomorphic line bundles on $X$.
This is an abelian group given by $L \tensor L'$ and inversion $L\to L\inv$.

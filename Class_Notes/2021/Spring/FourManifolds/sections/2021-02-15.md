Last time: we saw that \( \chi(\PP^1, \OO) = 1 \), and we'd like to generalize to holomorphic line bundles on a Riemann surface.
This will be the main ingredient for Riemann-Roch.


:::{.theorem title="?"}
Let $X \in \Mfd_\CC$ be compact and let \( \bundle{F} \) be a holomorphic vector bundle on \( X \) (or more generally a finitely-generated \( \OO\dash \)module, i.e. a coherent sheaf).
Then $\chi$ is well-defined and in fact \( h^{> \dim_\CC X}(X; \bundle{F} ) = 0\).

:::{.remark}
The locally constant sheaf \( \constantsheaf{\CC} \) is not an \( \OO\dash \)module, i.e. \( \constantsheaf{\CC}(U) \not\in \mods{\OO(U)} \).
In fact, $h^{2i}(X, \constantsheaf{\CC}) = \CC$ for all $i$.

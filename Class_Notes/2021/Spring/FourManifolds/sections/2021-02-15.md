Last time: we saw that \( \chi(\PP^1, \OO) = 1 \), and we'd like to generalize to holomorphic line bundles on a Riemann surface.
This will be the main ingredient for Riemann-Roch.


:::{.theorem title="?"}
Let $X \in \Mfd_\CC$ be compact and let \( \bundle{F} \) be a holomorphic vector bundle on \( X \) (or more generally a finitely-generated \( \OO\dash \)module, i.e. a coherent sheaf).
Then $\chi$ is well-defined and in fact \( h^{> \dim_\CC X}(X; \bundle{F} ) = 0\).

:::{.remark}
The locally constant sheaf \( \constantsheaf{\CC} \) is not an \( \OO\dash \)module, i.e. \( \constantsheaf{\CC}(U) \not\in \mods{\OO(U)} \).
In fact, $h^{2i}(X, \constantsheaf{\CC}) = \CC$ for all $i$.

:::{.proof title="?"}
We'll can resolve $\bundle{F}$ as a sheaf by first mapping to its smooth sections and continuing in the following way:
\[
0 \to \bundle{F} \to C^{\infty } \bundle{F} \mapsvia{\delbar} F \tensor A^{0, 1} \to \cdots
,\]
where $\delbar f = \sum_i \dd{f}{\conjugate{z}_i} \, d\conjugate{z}_i$.
Suppose we have a holomorphic trivialization of \( \ro {\bundle{F} }{U} \cong \OO_{U}^{\oplus r} \) and we have sections $(s_1, \cdots, s_r) \in C^{\infty } \bundle{F}(U)$, which are smooth functions on $U$.
In local coordinates we have $\delbar s \da (\delbar s_1, \cdots, \delbar s_r)$, is this well-defined globally?
Given a different trivialization over $V \subseteq X$, the $s_i$ are related by transition functions, so the new sections are $t_{UV}(s_1, \cdots, s_r)$ where $t_{UV}: U \intersect V \to \GL_r(\CC)$.
Since $t_{UV}$ are holomorphic, we have $\delbar( t_{UV} (s_1, \cdots, s_r)) = t_{UV} \delbar(s_1, \cdots, s_r)$.
This makes $\delbar: C^{\infty } \bundle{F} \to F\tensor A^{0, 1}$ a well-defined (but not $\OO\dash$linear) map.
We can thus continue this resolution using the Leibniz rule:

\[
0 \to \bundle{F} \to C^{\infty } \bundle{F} \mapsvia{\delbar} F \tensor A^{0, 1} \mapsvia{\delbar} \cdots F \tensor A^{0, 2} \mapsvia{\delbar} \cdots
,\]
which is an exact sequence of sheaves since $(A^{0, \wait}, \delbar)$ is exact.

\todo[inline]{Why? Split into line bundles?}

We can identify $C^{\infty }\sheaf{F} = \sheaf{F} \tensor A^{0, 0}$, and $\sheaf{F} \tensor A^{0, q}$ is a smooth vector bundle on $X$.
Using partitions of unity, we have that $\sheaf{F} \tensor A^{0, q}$ is acyclic, so its higher cohomology vanishes, and 
\[
H^i(X; \sheaf{F} ) \cong 
\frac
{ \ker ( \delbar: \sheaf{F}\tensor A^{0, i} \to \sheaf{F} \tensor A^{0, i+1} }
{ \im ( \delbar: \sheaf{F}\tensor A^{0, i-1} \to \sheaf{F} \tensor A^{0, i} }
.\]

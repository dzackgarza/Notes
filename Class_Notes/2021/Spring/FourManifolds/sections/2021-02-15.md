Last time: we saw that \( \chi(\PP^1, \OO) = 1 \), and we'd like to generalize to holomorphic line bundles on a Riemann surface.
This will be the main ingredient for Riemann-Roch.


:::{.theorem title="?"}
Let $X \in \Mfd_\CC$ be compact and let \( \bundle{F} \) be a holomorphic vector bundle on \( X \) (or more generally a finitely-generated \( \OO\dash \)module, i.e. a coherent sheaf).
Then $\chi$ is well-defined and in fact \( h^{> \dim_\CC X}(X; \bundle{F} ) = 0\).

:::{.remark}
The locally constant sheaf \( \constantsheaf{\CC} \) is not an \( \OO\dash \)module, i.e. \( \constantsheaf{\CC}(U) \not\in \mods{\OO(U)} \).
In fact, $h^{2i}(X, \constantsheaf{\CC}) = \CC$ for all $i$.

:::{.proof title="?"}
We'll can resolve $\bundle{F}$ as a sheaf by first mapping to its smooth sections and continuing in the following way:
\[
0 \to \bundle{F} \to C^{\infty } \bundle{F} \mapsvia{\delbar} F \tensor A^{0, 1} \to \cdots
,\]
where $\delbar f = \sum_i \dd{f}{\conjugate{z}_i} \, d\conjugate{z}_i$.
Suppose we have a holomorphic trivialization of \( \ro {\bundle{F} }{U} \cong \OO_{U}^{\oplus r} \) and we have sections $(s_1, \cdots, s_r) \in C^{\infty } \bundle{F}(U)$, which are smooth functions on $U$.
In local coordinates we have $\delbar s \da (\delbar s_1, \cdots, \delbar s_r)$, is this well-defined globally?
Given a different trivialization over $V \subseteq X$, the $s_i$ are related by transition functions, so the new sections are $t_{UV}(s_1, \cdots, s_r)$ where $t_{UV}: U \intersect V \to \GL_r(\CC)$.

Last time: Serre duality, and we'll review Riemann-Roch.
Recall that this depended on the statement that every holomorphic line bundle $L\to C$ for $C$ a complex curve is of the form $L = \OO(D)$ for some divisor $D$.
Then $\chi(C, L) = h^0(L) - h^1(L) = \deg L + 1 - g$, where $\deg L = \int_C c_1(L)$.
Serre duality said that the space of sections $H^1(C; L)$ is naturally isomorphic to $H^0(C, L ^{-1} \tensor \Omega_C^1)\dual$.
Notation: given $X \in \Mfd_\CC^n$ of complex dimension $n$, the **canonical bundle** is written $K_X \da \Omega_X^n$ and is the sheaf of holomorphic $n\dash$forms.
Serre duality will generalize: if \( \bundle{E}\to X \) is a holomorphic vector bundle, then $H^i(X; \bundle{E}) \cong H^{n-i}(X; \bundle{E}\dual \tensor K_X)\dual$.
Note that only $H^0, H^1$ are the only nontrivial degrees for a curve.
For 4-manifolds, we'll have an $H^2$ as well.

## Applications of Riemann-Roch


:::{.proposition title="?"}
There is a unique complex $X\in \Mfd_\CC$ diffeomorphic to $S^2$.

:::{.proof title="of proposition"}
Note existence is clear, since we can take $\CP^1 \da (\CC^2 \smz) / \vector x \sim \lambda\vector x$ for \( \lambda\in \CC\units \), which is identified as the set of complex lines through $0$ in $\CC^2$.
This decomposes as $\CC \union \CC = \ts{ [1, *] } \union \ts{ [*, 1] }$.
We now want to show that any two such complex manifolds are biholomorphic.
Let $X \in \Mfd_\CC^1$ with $X\cong_{C^{\infty }} S^2$, and consider for $p\in X$ the point bundle $\OO(p) \to X$.
The defining property was that there exists a section $s_p \in H^0(X; \OO(p) )$ which vanishes at first order at $p$:

\end{tikzpicture}

We have 
\[
\chi(X; \OO(p)) 
= \deg \OO(p) + 1 - g(x) = 1 + 1 - 0 = 2
.\]


:::{.exercise title="?"}
Check that $\deg \OO(p) = 1$.
:::

On the other hand we have
\[
\chi(X; \OO(p)) 
=
h^0(\OO(p)) - h^1( \OO(p) )
.\]

We have \( h^1( \OO(p) ) = H60( K \tensor \OO(-p) \), and $K_X = \Omega_X^1 = T\dual X$, so the question is:
what is the degree of $TX$ for $X\cong S^2$?
We need to compute $\int_X c_1(TX)$.

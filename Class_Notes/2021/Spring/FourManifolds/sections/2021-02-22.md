Last time: Serre duality, and we'll review Riemann-Roch.
Recall that this depended on the statement that every holomorphic line bundle $L\to C$ for $C$ a complex curve is of the form $L = \OO(D)$ for some divisor $D$.
Then $\chi(C, L) = h^0(L) - h^1(L) = \deg L + 1 - g$, where $\deg L = \int_C c_1(L)$.
Serre duality said that the space of sections $H^1(C; L)$ is naturally isomorphic to $H^0(C, L ^{-1} \tensor \Omega_C^1)\dual$.

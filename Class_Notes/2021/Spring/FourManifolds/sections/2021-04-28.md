:::{.remark}
Last time: we defined $\Pin(n) \subseteq \Cl(\RR^n)$ which was generated by $S^1(\RR^n)$.
These were units because $v^2 = -\norm{v}^2 = -1$, so $v\inv = -v$, and formed a group contained in $\Cl(\RR^n)\units$.
There is a decomposition $\Cl(V) = \Cl_0(V) \oplus \Cl_1(V)$ with a $\ZZ/2\dash$grading, and we defined 
\[
\Spin(V) \da \Pin(V) \intersect \Cl_0(V) = \gens{ vw \st v,w\in S^1(\RR^n) } 
.\]
There is a map
\[
\Pin(n) &\surjects O(n) \\
v & \mapsto (u\mapsto vuv\inv) = -R_{v^\perp}
,\]
which preserves $V^{\tensor 1} \subset \Cl(V)$, and was reflection about the hyperplane $v^\perp$.
There is also a SES
\[
0 \to \ZZ/2 \to \Spin(n) \mapsvia{\pi}  \SO(n) \to 0
,\]
where we used the fact that $\ker \pi \subset Z\Cl(\RR^n)$.
It turns out that $\Spin(n) = \univcover{ \SO(n) }$, using that $\pi_1( \SO(n), \pt) = \ZZ/2$ and checking that $\pm 1\in \Spin(n)$, yielding a nontrivial kernel.

This is local, at a single vector space, so we'll now try to globalise this to the tangent space of a manifold.

:::{.definition title="?"}
Let $(V, g)$ be an oriented smooth Riemannian manifold where $g$ is a metric on $TX$.
Define the **Clifford bundle** of $X$ by 
\[
\Cl(X) \da \Cl(T\dual X, g\dual)
,\]
where we've used the dual metric $g\dual$ on the cotangent bundle.

Recall that we set up a differential complex, whose objects were vector bundles and differentials were differential operators (i.e. linear combinations of partial derivatives) in local trivializations.
We pulled back to tangent bundles (?) and defined the *symbol* of an operator, and saw that when taking the symbol complex of the deRham complex. the sequence of maps was given by wedging against a tautological one-form.
This was an *elliptic complex* because the maps became wedging with a covector.

Let $X\in \Mfd_\CC$ and $\bundle{E}\to X \in \VectBundle_\CC$ be holomorphic.
There is a resolution
\[
0 \to \bundle{E} \mapsvia{i} \bundle{E} \tensor A^{0, 0} \mapsvia{\delbar} \bundle{E} \tensor A^{0, 1} \mapsvia{\delbar} \cdots
.\]
What is the symbol complex?
Consider the projection $\pi: T\dual X\to X$, and use pullbacks to get a sequence
\[
0 \to \pi^* \bundle{E} \tensor A^{0, 0} \mapsvia{\sigma( \delbar )} \pi^* \bundle{E} \tensor A^{0, 1} \mapsvia{\sigma( \delbar )} \cdots
.\]
Here the symbol \( \sigma(\delbar) \) replace $\dd{}{t \conj{z}_i}$ with the corresponding function on $T\dual X$, say $\conj{y}_i$.
Then \( \sigma( \delbar) = \sum_i \conj{y}_i \, d\conj{z}_i \wedge (\wait) = \conj{ \alpha } \wedge (\wait) \).
As before, at a point $(p, \alpha)$ where \( \alpha\neq 0 \) in \( T\dual X \), we get
\[
0 \to \bundle{E}_p \mapsvia{\conj{ \alpha} \wedge (\wait)} \bundle{E}_p \tensor \Wedge^{0, 1}_p X \mapsvia{\conj{ \alpha } \wedge (\wait)} \bundle{E}_p \tensor \Wedge^{0, 2} X \to \cdots
,\]
which is an exact sequence of vector spaces.
So \( ( \bundle{E} \tensor A^{0, p}, \delbar ) \) is an elliptic complex.

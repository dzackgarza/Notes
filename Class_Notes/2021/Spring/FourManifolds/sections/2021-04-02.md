Last time: if we have such a Hodge diamond, can we solve for $h^{1, 1}$?

\begin{tikzcd}
	&& 1 \\
	& q && q \\
	p && {h^{1, 1}} && p \\
	& q && q \\
	&& 1
\end{tikzcd}

Recall Noether's formula
\[
\chi(S, \OO_S)
&= \int \ch(\OO_S) \td(S) \\
&= \int_S {x_1 \over 1-e^{-x_1} } {x_2 \over 1- e^{-x_2} } \\
&= {K^2 + \chi_\Top(S) \over 12}
,\]
where $c_1(TS) = - K$ and $\chi_\Top$ is due to the Chern-Gauss-Bonet formula.
We have
\[
\chi(\OO_S) = h^0(\OO_S) - h_1(\OO_S) + h^2(\OO_S) = 1-q+p
.\]

On the other hand,
\[
\chi_\Top(S) = 1 -2q + (2p + h^{1, 1}) -4q = 1-4q + 2^p + h^{1, 1}
,\]
so 
\[
12(1-q+p) = K^2 + 2-4g + 2p + h^{1, 1} \implies h^{1, 1} = 110 - 8q + 10p-K^2
.\]

Recall the extraordinarily important exact sequence
\[
0 \to \OO(-p) \to \OO \to \OO_p \to 0
,\]
where the right-hand side is the sheaf of holomorphic functions vanishing at $p$ and this is an inclusion into the sheaf of holomorphic functions, and the right-hand term is the skyscraper sheaf.
There is a similar exact sequence for an embedded curve $C\embeds S$ in a surface:
\[
0 \to \OO_S(-C) \to \OO_S \to \OO_C \to 0
,\]
where the left term is the sheaf of holomorphic functions vanishing on $C$. 
Note that this has no global sections!
Any function vanishing along a compact subset (?) are constant (?).
Locally on an open set $U$, one can write $C \intersect U = V(f_u)$, since algebraically this ring is locally a PID.
So this is a line bundle, where we can map into the trivial bundle by $\phi \mapsto \phi/f_u$.
Thus
\[
\OO_S(U) / \OO_S(-C)(U) \cong \OO_C(C \intersect U )
.\]
We then get surjectivity since every holomorphic function on $C$ extends to a holomorphic function on $S$.

Now letting $\bundle{E} \in\Vect(\Holo)$, we can tensor this exact sequence to get
\[
0 \to \bundle{E}(-C) \to \bundle{E} \to \ro{\bundle{E}}{C} \to 0
,\]
which is also exact since locally we have the splitting principle.

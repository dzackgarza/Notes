Let $V = \ts{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^3 + e^{6k-1} = 0} \subseteq \CC^5$ and $S_\eps \da \ts{ \abs{a}^2 + \abs{b}^2 + \abs{c}^2 + \abs{d}^2 + \abs{e}^2}$.
Then $V_k \intersect S_\eps \cong S^7$ is a homeomorphism, and taking $k=1,2,\cdots 28$ yields the 28 smooth structures on $S^7$.
Notice that $V_k$ is the cone over $V_k \intersect S_\eps$.\begin{tikzpicture}

:::{.question}
Is every triangulable manifold PL, i.e. homeomorphic to a simplicial complex?
:::


:::{.answer}
No!
Given a simplicial complex, there is a notion of the **combinatorial link** of a vertex.

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node (node_one) at (0,0) {
  \includegraphics{/home/zack/SparkleShare/github.com/Notes/Class_Notes/2021/Spring/FourManifolds/sections/figures/2021-01-15_13-57}
  };
  \end{tikzpicture}

It turns out that there exist simplicial manifolds such that the link is not homeomorphic to a sphere, whereas every PL manifold admits a "PL triangulation" where the links are spheres.

:::{.remark}
What's special in dimension 4?
Recall the **Kirby-Siebenmann** invariant $ks(x) \in H^4(X; \ZZ_2)$ for $X$ a topological manifold where $ks(X) = 0 \iff X$ admits a PL structure, with the caveat that $\dim X \geq 5$.
We can use this to cook up an invariant of 4-manifolds.
:::


:::{.definition title="Kirby-Sibemann Invariant of a 4-manifold"}
Let $X$ be a topological manifold, then 
\[
ks(X) \da ks(X \cross \RR)
.\]
:::


:::{.remark}
Recall that in $\dim X\geq 7$, every PL manifold admits a smooth structure, and we can note that 
\[
H^4(X; \ZZ_2) = H^4(X \cross \RR; \ZZ_2) = \ZZ_2,
.\]
since every oriented 4-manifold admits a fundamental class.
Thus
\[
ks(X) = 

\begin{cases}
0 & X \cross \RR \text{ admits a PL and smooth structure} 
\\
1 & .X \cross \RR \text{ admits no PL or smooth structures }
\end{cases}
.\]
:::


:::{.remark}
$ks(X) \neq 0$ implies that $X$ has no smooth structure, since $X \cross \RR$ doesn't.
Note that it was not known if this invariant was nonzero for a while!
:::


:::{.remark}
Note that $H^2(X; \ZZ)$ admits a symmetric bilinear form $Q_X$ defined by 
\[
\inner{ \alpha}{ \beta} \mapsto \int_X \alpha\wedge \beta = \alpha \cupproduct \beta([X]) \in \ZZ
.\]
where $[X]$ is the fundamental class.
:::


:::{.theorem title="Freedman"}
If $X, Y$ are compact oriented topological 4-manifolds, then $X\cong Y$ are homeomorphic if and only if $ks(X) = ks(Y)$ and $Q_X \cong Q_Y$ are isometric, i.e. there exists an isometry 
\[
H^2(X; \ZZ) \to H^2(Y; \ZZ)
.\]
that preserves the two bilinear forms in the sense that $\inner {\varphi \alpha}{ \varphi \beta} = \inner{ \alpha}{ \beta}$.
Conversely, every **unimodular** bilinear form appears as $H^2(X; \ZZ)$ for some $X$, i.e. the pairing induces a map 
\[
H^2(X; \ZZ) &\to H^2(X; \ZZ)\dual \\
\alpha \mapsto \inner{ \alpha }{ \wait}
.\]
which is an isomorphism.
This is essentially a classification of simply-connected 4-manifolds.
:::


:::{.remark}
Note that preservation of a bilinear form is a stand-in for "being an element of the orthogonal group", where we only have a lattice instead of a full vector space.
:::


:::{.remark}
\( H^2(X; \ZZ) \mapsvia{PD} H_2(X; \ZZ) \), where we can think of elements in the latter as closed surfaces $[\Sigma]$, and
\[
\inner{ \Sigma_1 }{ \Sigma_2 } = \text{signed number of intersections points of } \Sigma_1 \transverse \Sigma_2
.\]
Note that Freedman's theorem is only about homeomorphism, and is not true smoothly.
This gives a way to show that two 4-manifolds are homeomorphic, but this is hard to prove!
So we'll black-box this, and focus on ways to show that two *smooth* 4-manifolds are *not* diffeomorphic, since we want homeomorphic but non-diffeomorphic manifolds.
:::


:::{.definition title="Signature"}
The **signature** of a topological 4- manifold is the signature of $Q_X$, where we note that $Q_X$ is a symmetric nondegenerate bilinear form on $H^2(X; \RR)$ and for some $a, b$
\[
H^2(X; \RR), Q_x \mapsvia{\text{isometric}} \RR^{3b}
.\]
where $a$ is the number of $+1$s appearing in the matrix and $b$ is the number of $-1$s
\[

\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0
\\
0 & \vdots & 0
\\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
.\]
Then the signature is $a-b$, the dimension of the positive-definite space minus the dimension of the negative-definite space.

:::

:::{.theorem title="Rohklin's Theorem"}
Suppose $\inner{ \alpha}{\alpha} \in 2\ZZ$ and \( \alpha\in H^2(X; \ZZ) \) and $X$ a simply connected **smooth** 4-manifold. Then 16 divides $\sig(X)$.
:::


:::{.remark}
Note that Freedman's theorem implies that there exists topological 4-manifolds with no smooth structure.
:::


:::{.theorem title="Donaldson"}
Let $X$ be a smooth simply-connected 4-manifold.
If $a=0$ or $b=0$, then $Q_X$ is diagonalizable and there exists an orthonomal basis of $H^2(X; \ZZ)$.
:::


:::{.remark}
This comes from Gram-Schmidt.

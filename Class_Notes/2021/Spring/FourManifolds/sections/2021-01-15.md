Let $V = \ts{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^3 + e^{6k-1} = 0} \subseteq \CC^5$ and $S_\eps \da \ts{ \abs{a}^2 + \abs{b}^2 + \abs{c}^2 + \abs{d}^2 + \abs{e}^2}$.
Then $V_k \intersect S_\eps \cong S^7$ is a homeomorphism, and taking $k=1,2,\cdots 28$ yields the 28 smooth structures on $S^7$.
Notice that $V_k$ is the cone over $V_k \intersect S_\eps$.\begin{tikzpicture}

:::{.question}
Is every triangulable manifold PL, i.e. homeomorphic to a simplicial complex?
:::


:::{.answer}
No!
Given a simplicial complex, there is a notion of the **combinatorial link** of a vertex.

\begin{tikzpicture}

  \includegraphics{/home/zack/SparkleShare/github.com/Notes/Class_Notes/2021/Spring/FourManifolds/sections/figures/2021-01-15_13-57}
  };
  \end{tikzpicture}

It turns out that there exist simplicial manifolds such that the link is not homeomorphic to a sphere, whereas every PL manifold admits a "PL triangulation" where the links are spheres.

:::{.remark}
What's special in dimension 4?
Recall the **Kirby-Siebenmann** invariant $ks(x) \in H^4(X; \ZZ_2)$ for $X$ a topological manifold where $ks(X) = 0 \iff X$ admits a PL structure, with the caveat that $\dim X \geq 5$.
We can use this to cook up an invariant of 4-manifolds.
:::


:::{.definition title="Kirby-Sibemann Invariant of a 4-manifold"}
Let $X$ be a topological manifold, then 
\[
ks(X) \da ks(X \cross \RR)
.\]
:::


:::{.remark}
Recall that in $\dim X\geq 7$, every PL manifold admits a smooth structure, and we can note that 
\[
H^4(X; \ZZ_2) = H^4(X \cross \RR; \ZZ_2) = \ZZ_2,
.\]
since every oriented 4-manifold admits a fundamental class.
Thus
\[
ks(X) = 

\begin{cases}
0 & X \cross \RR \text{ admits a PL and smooth structure} 
\\
1 & .X \cross \RR \text{ admits no PL or smooth structures }
\end{cases}
.\]
:::


:::{.remark}
$ks(X) \neq 0$ implies that $X$ has no smooth structure, since $X \cross \RR$ doesn't.
Note that it was not known if this invariant was nonzero for a while!
:::


:::{.remark}
Note that $H^2(X; \ZZ)$ admits a symmetric bilinear form $Q_X$ defined by 
\[
\inner{ \alpha}{ \beta} \mapsto \int_X \alpha\wedge \beta = \alpha \cupproduct \beta([X]) \in \ZZ
.\]
where $[X]$ is the fundamental class.
:::


:::{.theorem title="Freedman"}
If $X, Y$ are compact oriented topological 4-manifolds, then $X\cong Y$ are homeomorphic if and only if $ks(X) = ks(Y)$ and $Q_X \cong Q_Y$ are isometric, i.e. there exists an isometry 
\[
H^2(X; \ZZ) \to H^2(Y; \ZZ)
.\]
that preserves the two bilinear forms in the sense that $\inner {\varphi \alpha}{ \varphi \beta} = \inner{ \alpha}{ \beta}$.
Conversely, every **unimodular** bilinear form appears as $H^2(X; \ZZ)$ for some $X$, i.e. the pairing induces a map 
\[
H^2(X; \ZZ) &\to H^2(X; \ZZ)\dual \\
\alpha \mapsto \inner{ \alpha }{ \wait}
.\]
which is an isomorphism.
This is essentially a classification of simply-connected 4-manifolds.

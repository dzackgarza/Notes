For a K3 surface, consider $S = \ts{ \sum_{i=0}^4 x_i^4 = 0 } \subset \CP^3$.
By the adjunction formula, $K_S = \ro{\qty{ K_{\CP^3} + \OO_{\CP^3}(S) }}{S}$.
Recall that line bundles on $\CP^n$ were in bijection with $\ZZ$, where send $d$ to a bundle $\OO(d) \da \OO_{\CP^N}(d)$.
We produced the tautological line bundle $\OO(-1)$ whose fiber over $\vector x \subseteq \CP^n$ is the line in $\CC^n$ spanned by its coordinates. 
We have $\OO(-1)\dual \da \OO(1)$, and $\OO(n)\da \OO(1)^{\otimes n}$.
Alternatively, it was characterized in terms of homogeneous functions, where the fiber $\OO(n)_{\vector x}$

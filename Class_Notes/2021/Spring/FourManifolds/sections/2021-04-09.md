Recall that line bundles on $\CP^n$ were in bijection with $\ZZ$, where send $d$ to a bundle $\OO(d) \da \OO_{\CP^N}(d)$.
We produced the tautological line bundle $\OO(-1)$ whose fiber over $\vector x \subseteq \CP^n$ is the line in $\CC^n$ spanned by its coordinates. 
We have $\OO(-1)\dual \da \OO(1)$, and $\OO(n)\da \OO(1)^{\otimes n}$.
Alternatively, it was characterized in terms of homogeneous functions, where the fiber $\OO(n)_{\vector x}$ are the linear functions $L$ on lines $\ts{\lambda \vector x} \to \CC$ such that $L(\lambda p) = \lambda^n L(p)$.
Noting that these are linear functions, such $L$ form a 1-dimensional $\CC\dash$vector space.

The classic example is $x_0 \in \OO(1)_{\vector x}$ since $x_0( \lambda p) = \lambda x_0 (p)$.
Similarly, $x_0^2 + x_1 x_2 \in \OO(2)_{\vector x}$ since 
\[
x_0^2 + x_1 x_2 (\lambda p) = \lambda^2 (x_0^2 + x_1 x_2(p))
.\]

Note that the global sections were given by $\Gamma^0(\PP^n, \OO(d)) = H^0(\PP^n; \OO(d))$ was the span of degree $d$ monomials in $x_0, \cdots, x_n$.

For a K3 surface, consider $S = \ts{ \sum_{i=0}^4 x_i^4 = 0 } \subset \CP^3$.
By the adjunction formula, $K_S = \ro{\qty{ K_{\CP^3} + \OO_{\CP^3}(S) }}{S}$.

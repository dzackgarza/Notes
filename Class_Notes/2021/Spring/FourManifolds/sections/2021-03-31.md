We have a perfect pairing 
\[
\Omega^k \tensor \Omega^{n-k} \to K
,\]
and thus \( \Omega^{n-k} \cong K \tensor (\Omega^{k})\dual \).
So we have \( H^p( \Omega^k )\dual \cong H^{n-p}( (\Omega^{k})\dual \tensor K  ) = H^{n-p}( \Omega^{n-k}) \), and thus \( h^{p, k} = h^{n-p, n-k} \), which recovers what we knew about $\hodgestar: \mathcal{H}^{p, q} \to \mathcal{H} ^{n-p, n-q}$.

So we don't get anything new from the Serre duality argument.

What is special when $X\in \CY$ is that 
\[
\Omega^{n-k} \cong ( \Omega^k )\dual = \Wedge^k TX
\]
for $TX$ the tangent bundle.
Note that taking the cotangent bundle gives forms, and instead this gives a bundle of *polyvector fields*.

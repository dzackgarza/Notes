We have a perfect pairing 
\[
\Omega^k \tensor \Omega^{n-k} \to K
,\]
and thus \( \Omega^{n-k} \cong K \tensor (\Omega^{k})\dual \).
So we have \( H^p( \Omega^k )\dual \cong H^{n-p}( (\Omega^{k})\dual \tensor K  ) = H^{n-p}( \Omega^{n-k}) \), and thus \( h^{p, k} = h^{n-p, n-k} \), which recovers what we knew about $\hodgestar: \mathcal{H}^{p, q} \to \mathcal{H} ^{n-p, n-q}$.

So we don't get anything new from the Serre duality argument.

What is special when $X\in \CY$ is that 
\[
\Omega^{n-k} \cong ( \Omega^k )\dual = \Wedge^k TX
\]
for $TX$ the tangent bundle.
Note that taking the cotangent bundle gives forms, and instead this gives a bundle of *polyvector fields*.
For $k=1$, we get a holomorphic vector field, which one might think of as an infinitesimal biholomorphism.

$\PP^1$ has a holomorphic vector field in coordinate charts $\CC \cong \ts{ [z: 1] \in \PP^1 }$ which we'll write as $z\dd{}{z}$.
The coordinate chart is $\PP^1 \sm \infty$, so we obtain

\end{tikzpicture}

Does this vector field $V$ extend over $\infty$?
The local coordinate at $\infty$ is $w = 1/z$, so $z=1/w$ and we can compute
\[
{1\over w} \dd{}{1\over w} = {1\over w} {\partial \over {-1\over w^2} \partial w} = -w \dd{}{w}
.\]
We have $\ord_0V = 1$ and $\ord_{\infty } V = 1$, and so $\deg T\PP^1 = 2$.

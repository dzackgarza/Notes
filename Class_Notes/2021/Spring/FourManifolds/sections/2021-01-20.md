Today: some background material on sheaves, bundles, connections.

Recall that if $X$ is a topological space, a **presheaf** of abelian groups \( \mathcal{F}  \) is an assignment $U\to \mathcal{F}(U)$ of an abelian group to every open set $U \subseteq X$ together with a restriction map \( \rho_{UV}: \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(V)   \) for any inclusion \( V \subseteq U \) of open sets.
This data has to satisfying certain conditions:

- \( \mathcal{F}(\emptyset) = 0  \), the trivial abelian group.

- \( \rho_{UU}: \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(U) = \id_{\mathcal{F}(U) }   \) 

- Compatibility if restriction is taken in steps: $U \subseteq V \subseteq W \implies \rho_{VW} \circ \rho_{UV} = \rho_{UW}$.

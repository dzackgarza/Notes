# Lecture 3 (Wednesday, January 20)

Today: some background material on sheaves, bundles, connections.

Recall that if $X$ is a topological space, a **presheaf** of abelian groups \( \mathcal{F}  \) is an assignment $U\to \mathcal{F}(U)$ of an abelian group to every open set $U \subseteq X$ together with a restriction map \( \rho_{UV}: \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(V)   \) for any inclusion \( V \subseteq U \) of open sets.
This data has to satisfying certain conditions:

- \( \mathcal{F}(\emptyset) = 0  \), the trivial abelian group.

- \( \rho_{UU}: \mathcal{F}(U) \to \mathcal{F}(U) = \id_{\mathcal{F}(U) }   \) 

- Compatibility if restriction is taken in steps: $U \subseteq V \subseteq W \implies \rho_{VW} \circ \rho_{UV} = \rho_{UW}$.

We say \( \mathcal{F}  \) is a **sheaf** if additionally:

- Given $s_i \in \mathcal{F}(U_i)$ such that \( \rho_{U_i \intersect U_j} (s_i) = \rho_{U_i \intersect U_j} (s_j) \) implies that there exists a unique \( s\in \mathcal{F}(\Union_i U_i)  \) such that \( \rho_{U_i}(s) = s_i \).

Let $X$ be a topological manifold, then \( \mathcal{F}\da C^0(\wait, \RR)  \) the set of continuous functionals form a sheaf.

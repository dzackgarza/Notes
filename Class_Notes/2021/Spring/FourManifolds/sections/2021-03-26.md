Recall the Hodge decomposition theorem.
Let $(M, g) \in \Mfd_\RR^n(\Riem, \cpt)$, then choosing an orthonormal basis \( \ts{ v_j } \) for $T_p M$ yields a corresponding orthonormal basis in $T_p\dual M \da \Hom_\RR(T_p M, \RR)$ given by taking \( \ts{ e_i \st e_i(v_j) = \delta_{ij} } \).

There is a map
\[
\hodgestar: \Wedge^k T_p\dual M &\to \Wedge^{n-k} T_p\dual M \\
\Wedge_{j=1}^k e_{i_j} &\mapsto \pm \Wedge_{\ell = 1}^{n-k} e_{j_\ell}
\]
where the $e_{j}$ are defined such that $\Wedge_{j=1}^k e_{i_j} \wedge \Wedge_{\ell = 1}^{n-k} e_{j_\ell} \da \dV$, where $\dV$ is the volume form on $M$ at $p$.
Thus we have a map
\[
\hodgestar: \Omega^k &\to \Omega^{n-k} \\ 
1 &\mapsto \dV
.\]
 We defined $d^\dagger \da \stardstar$, and said a form \( \omega \) was *harmonic* iff $\Delta \omega=0$, where \( \Delta \da dd^\dagger + d^\dagger d \).
 The space of such forms was denoted \( \mathcal{H}^k(M) \subseteq \Omega^k(M)  \).

:::{.theorem title="?"}
As $n\to \infty$, we have $H^*(BO_n, \ZZ/2\ZZ) = \ZZ/2\ZZ[w_1, w_2, \cdots]$ where $w_i \in H^i$.
:::

:::{.definition title="?"}
Given any principal $O_n\dash$bundle $P\to X$, there is an induced map $X \mapsvia{f} BO_n$, so we can pull back the above generators to define the **Stiefel-Whitney classes** $f^* w_i$.
:::


:::{.remark}
If $P \da \OFrame TX$, then $f^* w_1$ measures whether $X$ has an orientation, i.e. $f^* w_1 = 0 \iff X$ can be oriented.
We also have $f^* w_i(P) = w_i( \bundle{E} )$ where $P = \OFrame( \bundle{E} )$.
In general, we'll just write $w_i$ for Stiefel-Whitney classes and $c_i$ for Chern classes.
:::


:::{.definition title="Pontryagin Classes"}
The **Pontryagin classes** of a real vector bundle \( \bundle{E} \) are defined as 
\[
p_i( \bundle{E} ) = (-1)^i c_{2i}( \bundle{E} \tensor_\RR \CC)
.\]
Note that the complexified bundle above is a complex vector bundle with the same transition functions as \( \bundle{E} \).

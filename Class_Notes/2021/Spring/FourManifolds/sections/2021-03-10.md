Can we always get a Hermitian metric?
Let $X \in \Mfd_{\RR}$ and \( \bundle{E} \to X \in \VectBund_{\CC} \) a smooth complex vector bundle.
Then any section $h\in \bundle{E}\dual \tensor \conj{\bundle{E}}\dual(X)$, we have
\[
h: \bundle{E} \tensor \conj{\bundle{E}} \to \OO \\
h( e\tensor f) 
.\]
for \( e, f \in \bundle{E}_p \) is a Hermitian form for all $p$.
In local trivializations, $\ro{\bundle{E}}{U} \cong \OO_U^{\oplus r}$, and one can take the standard Hermitian form here.
Then for $(f_1, \cdots, f_r) \in \OO^{\oplus r}(U)$, we have \( \sum f_i \bar f_i\in \OO(U) \).
This can be extended to all of $X$ using a partition of unity subordinate to the coordinate charts.

The thing to check here is that on $\CC^r$, for any collection $h_1, \cdots, h_n$, any positive linear combination \( \sum a_i h_i \) is again a Hermitian metric for any \( a_i \in \RR^+ \).
One can regard these as skew-symmetric matrices, which are closed under addition, and the positive-definite property ensures it's still a metric since $h(v, v) = \sum a_i h_i(v, v) > 0$ for $v\neq 0$.

Recall that we start with a Riemannian manifold $(X, g)$ where $g: TX^{\otimes 2} \to \OO$ is a metric on the tangent bundle.
Locally choose $f_1,\cdots, f_n$ an orthogonal frame of $TX$, then setting $e_i \da f_i\dual$ yields an orthogonal frame of $T\dual X$ and thus an orthogonal frame $e_{i_1} \wedge \cdots e_{i_p}$ of $\Wedge^p T\dual X \da \Omega^p X$.
So we get a metric on the smooth $p\dash$forms \( \Omega^p X \).
We defined the Hodge star operator
\[
\hodgestar: \Omega^p &\to \Omega^{n-p} \\
e_{i_1} \wedge \cdots e_{i_p} &\mapsto \pm e_{j_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{j_{n-p}}
.\]
where \( \ts{ i_1, \cdots, i_p, j_1, \cdots, j_{n-p} } = \ts{ e_1, \cdots, e_n } \).
We saw that 
\[
e_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_p} \hodgestar \qty{ e_1 \wedge \cdots e_{i_p}} &= e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge e_n \\
\hodgestar \qty{ \sum_{\abs I = p } f_I e_I} &= \sum_{ \abs I = p} e_{I^c} (-1)^{\sign(I)}
.\]

Moreover, 
\[
\inner{ \alpha}{ \beta} = \int_X g( \alpha, \beta) dV = \int_X \alpha\wedge \qty{\hodgestar \beta}
,\]
and we showed that 
\[
\inner{ \alpha}{ d \beta} = \pm \inner{ d^\dagger \alpha}{ \beta}
&& 
d^\dagger \da \hodgestar d \hodgestar, \beta\in \Omega^{p-1}(X), \alpha\in \Omega^p(X)
,\]
yielding an adjoint operator
\[
d^\dagger: \Omega^p(X) \to \Omega^{p-1}(X)
.\]

:::{.definition title="Laplacian"}
The **Laplacian** is the differential operator
\[
\Delta \da dd^\dagger + d^\dagger d: \Omega^p(X) \to \Omega^p(X)
.\]

:::{.definition title="Harmonic Forms"}
A $p\dash$form \( \omega \) is **harmonic** if and only if \( \Delta \omega = 0 \).
We define \( \mathcal{H}^p(X)  \) as the space of harmonic $p\dash$forms.
:::


:::{.remark}
This operator is $\RR\dash$linear, so \( \mathcal{H}^p(X) \in \Vect_\RR  \).
Note that this whole construction can be made to work over $\CC$ by adding conjugates in appropriate places.
:::


:::{.proposition title="?"}
A smooth $p\dash$form \( \omega \) is harmonic if and only if \( d \omega = d^\dagger \omega = 0 \).
:::


:::{.proof title="?"}
$\impliedby$:
This direct is easy, since $\Delta \omega \da (dd^\dagger + d^\dagger d) \omega = d(0) + d^\dagger 0 = 0$.

$\implies$:
A nice trick! 
Using the adjunction $d, d^\dagger$ we have
\[
\inner{ \Delta \omega}{ \omega}
&=
\inner{ d d^\dagger \omega}{ \omega} +
\inner{d^\dagger \omega}{ \omega}
\\
&=
\inner{ d^\dagger \omega}{ d^\dagger \omega} +
\inner{d \omega}{ d \omega}
.\]
We now use that since $g$ is positive definite, it is a non-negative smooth function, and 
\[
\inner{ \alpha}{ \alpha} \da \int_X g( \alpha, \alpha) dV \geq 0 \text{ with equality } \iff \alpha \equiv 0 \text{ on } X
.\]
So we can conclude that $d^\dagger \omega = d \omega = 0$.

:::{.warnings}
Note that we've used that the inner product is symmetric over $\RR$.
Over $\CC$, there are bars introduced from conjugation when swapping the variables.
:::



:::{.proposition title="?"}
The following three subspaces of \( \Omega^p(X) \) are mutually orthogonal:
\[
d \Omega^{p-1}(X), \mathcal{H}^p(X), d^\dagger \Omega^{p+1}(X) 
.\]

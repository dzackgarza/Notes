Can we always get a Hermitian metric?
Let $X \in \Mfd_{\RR}$ and \( \bundle{E} \to X \in \VectBund_{\CC} \) a smooth complex vector bundle.
Then any section $h\in \bundle{E}\dual \tensor \conj{\bundle{E}}\dual(X)$, we have
\[
h: \bundle{E} \tensor \conj{\bundle{E}} \to \OO \\
h( e\tensor f) 
.\]
for \( e, f \in \bundle{E}_p \) is a Hermitian form for all $p$.
In local trivializations, $\ro{\bundle{E}}{U} \cong \OO_U^{\oplus r}$, and one can take the standard Hermitian form here.
Then for $(f_1, \cdots, f_r) \in \OO^{\oplus r}(U)$, we have \( \sum f_i \bar f_i\in \OO(U) \).
This can be extended to all of $X$ using a partition of unity subordinate to the coordinate charts.

The thing to check here is that on $\CC^r$, for any collection $h_1, \cdots, h_n$, any positive linear combination \( \sum a_i h_i \) is again a Hermitian metric for any \( a_i \in \RR^+ \).
One can regard these as skew-symmetric matrices, which are closed under addition, and the positive-definite property ensures it's still a metric since $h(v, v) = \sum a_i h_i(v, v) > 0$ for $v\neq 0$.

Recall that we start with a Riemannian manifold $(X, g)$ where $g: TX^{\otimes 2} \to \OO$ is a metric on the tangent bundle.
Locally choose $f_1,\cdots, f_n$ an orthogonal frame of $TX$, then setting $e_i \da f_i\dual$ yields an orthogonal frame of $T\dual X$ and thus an orthogonal frame $e_{i_1} \wedge \cdots e_{i_p}$ of $\Wedge^p T\dual X \da \Omega^p X$.
So we get a metric on the smooth $p\dash$forms \( \Omega^p X \).
We defined the Hodge star operator
\[
\hodgestar: \Omega^p &\to \Omega^{n-p} \\
e_{i_1} \wedge \cdots e_{i_p} &\mapsto \pm e_{j_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{j_{n-p}}
.\]

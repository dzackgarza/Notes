Note that critical points can be used to compute the Euler characteristic, using the fact the $\chi(C) = \chi(H_*(C))$, i.e. it can be computed on dimensions of chains or ranks of homology, along with the fact that Morse homology is isomorphic to singular homology.
So e.g. for a 3-manifold $M^3$, we can show
\[
\chi(M^3) = \sum_{i=0}^3 \rk H_i 
= \sum_{i=0}^3 \rk CM_i \\
= 1 - \# \crit_1(f) + \# \crit_2(f) - 1 \\
=0
,\]
since the number of index 2 and index 3 critical points will be the same.

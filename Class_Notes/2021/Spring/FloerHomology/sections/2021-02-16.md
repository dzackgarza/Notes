Note that critical points can be used to compute the Euler characteristic, using the fact the $\chi(C) = \chi(H_*(C))$, i.e. it can be computed on dimensions of chains or ranks of homology, along with the fact that Morse homology is isomorphic to singular homology.
So e.g. for a 3-manifold $M^3$, we can show
\[
\chi(M^3) = \sum_{i=0}^3 \rk H_i 
= \sum_{i=0}^3 \rk CM_i \\
= 1 - \# \crit_1(f) + \# \crit_2(f) - 1 \\
=0
,\]
since the number of index 2 and index 3 critical points will be the same.

## Symmetric Product Spaces

Let $M^3$ be a closed 3-manifold, then there is a Heegard splitting 
\[
(\Sigma_g, \alpha = \ts{ \alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_g }, \beta = \ts{ \beta_1, \cdots, \beta_g } =( \Sigma_g, H_ \alpha, H_ \beta) && \bd(H_ \alpha) = \bd( H_ \beta) = \Sigma
,\]
where $M^3 = H_{ \alpha} \coprod_{ \Sigma} H_ \beta$ and $g$ is the genus of $HD$.
We refer to \( \Sigma \) as a **Heegard surface**, and this set of data as a **Heegard diagram**.

### Description
  
"I am teaching a topics course about Heegaard Floer homology next semester. Heegaard Floer homology was defined by Peter Ozsváth and Zoltan Szabó around 2000. It is a package of powerful invariants of smooth 3- and 4-manifolds, knots/links and contact structures. Over the last two decades, it has become a central tool in low-dimensional topology. It has been used extensively to study and resolve important questions concerning unknotting number, slice genus, knot concordance and Dehn surgery. It has been employed in critical ways to study taut foliations, contact structures and smooth 4-manifolds. There are also many rich connections between Heegaard Floer homology and other manifold and knot invariants coming from gauge theory as well as representation theory. We will learn the basic construction of Heegaard Floer homology, starting with the definition of the 3-manifold and knot invariants. In the second half of this course, we will turn to computations and applications of the theory to low-dimensional topology and knot theory. In particular, several numerical invariants have been defined using this homological invariants. At the end of the semester, I would expect each one of you to learn the construction of one of these invariants (of course with my help) and present it to the class."

## Intro and Motivation

We'll assume everything is smooth and oriented.

:::{.proposition title="Osvath-Szabo (2000)"}
To closed 3-manifolds $M$ we can assign a graded abelian group $\hat{HF}(M)$, which can be computed combinatorially
[^see_sarjour_combinatorial]
.
There are several variants: 

- $HF^- \in \grMod(\ZZ_2[u])$,
[^hfminus_strongest]

- $HF^+ \in \Mod(\ZZ_2[u, u ^{-1} ] / u \ZZ_2[u])$.

- $HF^\infty \in \grMod(\ZZ_2[u, u ^{-1} ])$, 

$HF^+$ and $HF^\infty$ can be computed using $HF^-$.
In general, we'll write $HF^\wait$ to denote constructions that work with any of the above variants.

[^see_sarjour_combinatorial]: 
See Sarkour-Wang

[^hfminus_strongest]: 
This is the strongest variant.

:::

:::{.remark}
Note that $\ZZ_2$ can be replaced with $\ZZ$, but it's technical and we won't discuss it here.
For the first half of the course, we'll just discuss $\hat{HF}$, and we'll discuss the latter 3 in the second half.

### Geometric Information

These invariants can be used to compute the **Thurston seminorm** of a 3-manifold: 


:::{.definition title="Thurston Seminorm"}
A homology class \( \alpha\in H_2(M)\) can be represented as \( \alpha\in [S] \) for $S$ a closed surface whose fundamental class represents \( \alpha \) where $S = \Union_{i=1}^n S_i$ can be a union of closed embedded surfaces $S_i$.
Then we first compute
\[
\max\ts{0, - \chi(S_i) } 
=
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } S_i \cong \SS^2, \TT^2 \\ 
\\
- \chi(S_i) = 2g(S_i) - 2  & \text{ else} .
\end{cases}
.\]
Note that the max checks if \( \chi \) is positive.
Then define
\[
\norm{ \alpha } \da \min_S \qty{ \sum_{i=1}^n 
\max\ts{0, - \chi(S_i) } }
,\]
where we sum over the embedded subsurfaces and check which overall surface gives the smallest norm.

:::

:::{.remark}
Note that this can't be a norm, since if $\SS^2, \TT^2 \in [S] \implies \norm \alpha = 0$.
:::


:::{.theorem title="Osvath-Szabo"}
$HF$ detects
[^detects_means]
the Thurston seminorm, and there is a splitting as groups/modules
\[
HF^\wait(M) = \bigoplus _{\mathfrak{s} \in \Spin^c(M)} HF^\wait(M, S) 
\] 
where $S \in \Spin^c(M)$ is a **spin$^c$ structure**: an oriented 2-dimensional vector bundle on $M$ (up to some equivalence).


[^detects_means]: 
What does "detect" mean? This is slightly technical.

:::


:::{.remark}

The Thurston norm $\norm{a}$ can be computed from this data by considering a perturbed version of $\hat{HF}$, denoted $\underline{\hat{HF}}$, in the following way: taking the first Chern class $c_1(\mathfrak{s}) \in H^2(M)$ (which can be associated to every 2-dimensional vector bundle), we have 
\[
\norm{ \alpha} = \max_{\underline{\hat{HF}}(M, \mathfrak{s}  ) \neq 0 }
\abs{\inner{ c_1(\mathfrak{s})  }{ \alpha }  }
.\]
:::

:::{.slogan}
Floer homology groups split over these spin$^c$ structures and can be used to compute Thurston norms.
:::


:::{.theorem title="Ni"}
Given $F \subseteq M$ with genus $g\geq 2$, $HF$ detects if $M$ *fibers* over $S^1$ with $F$ as a fiber, i.e. there exists a fiber bundle

\begin{tikzcd}
F 
  \ar[r, hook] 
& 
M
  \ar[d, "\pi"] 
\\
& 
S^1 
\end{tikzcd}
:::


:::{.remark}
This uses the existence of the splitting over spin$^c$ structures and uses $HF^+$.
:::






:::{.definition title="Contact Structure"}
Equivalently,

- A smooth oriented nowhere integrable 2-plane field $\xi$, or

- \( \xi = \ker( \alpha) \) where \( \alpha \) is a 1-form such that \( \alpha\wedge d \alpha > 0 \).
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
The standard contact structure on $\RR^3$ is given by 
\[
\alpha\da dz - ydz
.\]
:::

Knot floer homology: given a knot $K \subseteq M$ there is a filtration on $\hat{CF}(M)$, which yields a bigraded group $\hat{HFK}(M, K)$ which is also a $\ZZ_2\dash$vector space.
There is similarly $HFK^-(M, K)$ which is a bigraded $\ZZ_2[U] \dash$module, and

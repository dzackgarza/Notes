# The Heegard-Floer Chain Complex & Maslov Index (Tuesday, March 02)


Last time: to strengthen the homology theory, take a **pointed** Heegard diagram \( (\Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z \in \Sigma\sm \alpha\union \beta \) and define a new chain complex
\[
\Hat{CF}( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z) = \bigoplus_{ x\in \TT_ \alpha \intersect \TT_ \beta} \ZZ/2 \gens{ x } \\
\bd x = \sum_{y \in \TT_ \alpha \intersect\TT_ \beta} \sum_{ \varphi\in \pi_2(x, y), \mu( \varphi) = 1, n_z(\varphi) = 0} \# \hat{ \mathcal{M}}(\varphi) y 
.\]
Note that \( n_z( \varphi) = 0 \) means that the coefficient attached to the region containing $z$ is zero.
Recall that we had diagram moves, how do they translate to the pointed setting?

- Allow *pointed isotopies*, which are isotopies disjoint from $z$.
- Allow *pointed handleslides*, where now the bounded pair-of-pants is disjoint from $z$:

- Allow isotopies of the base point.

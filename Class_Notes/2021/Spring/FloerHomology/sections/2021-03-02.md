# The Heegard-Floer Chain Complex & Maslov Index (Tuesday, March 02)


Last time: to strengthen the homology theory, take a **pointed** Heegard diagram \( (\Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z \in \Sigma\sm \alpha\union \beta \) and define a new chain complex
\[
\Hat{CF}( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z) = \bigoplus_{ x\in \TT_ \alpha \intersect \TT_ \beta} \ZZ/2 \gens{ x } \\
\bd x = \sum_{y \in \TT_ \alpha \intersect\TT_ \beta} \sum_{ \varphi\in \pi_2(x, y), \mu( \varphi) = 1, n_z(\varphi) = 0} \# \hat{ \mathcal{M}}(\varphi) y 
.\]
Note that \( n_z( \varphi) = 0 \) means that the coefficient attached to the region containing $z$ is zero.
Recall that we had diagram moves, how do they translate to the pointed setting?

- Allow *pointed isotopies*, which are isotopies disjoint from $z$.
- Allow *pointed handleslides*, where now the bounded pair-of-pants is disjoint from $z$:

- Allow isotopies of the base point.


:::{.lemma title="?"}
Any two pointed Heegard diagrams for a 3-manifold $M^3$ can be connected by a sequence of the following moves:

- Stabilization or destabilization,
- Pointed isotopy,
- Pointed handleslides,
- Isotopes of the basepoint away from \( \alpha, \beta \).

Prove this lemma.

:::{.example title="$S^3$"}
Here is the simplest Heegard diagram from $S^3$:

Here there is just one one intersection point, so $\hat{\CF} = \ZZ/2\gens{ x } $ is 1-dimensional, and \( \bd x = 0 \).
So $\hat{\HF} = \ZZ/2$.

:::{.example title="$\RP^3$"}
We can write $\RP^3 = L(2 ,1)$ and produce the following Heegard diagram:

Is there a disc between $x$ and $y$?
We can check the obstruction $\eps(x, y)$ by labeling the generators in homology and tracing the following green path:

:::{.remark}
Goal: we want to use **Lagrangian Floer homology** to defined invariants of *closed* 3-manifolds, where here closed means that \( \bd M^3 = \emptyset \).
One example of Lagrangian Floer homology is **Heegard Floer homology**.
We'll want some symplectic manifold with two Lagrangian submanifolds.
Oszvath-Szabo used a 2-dimensional description of closed 3-manifolds called **Heegard diagrams**.
We'll need Heegard splittings to define these, and handlebodies to define the splittings.

:::{.definition title="Handlebody of genus $g$"}
A **handlebody** of genus $g$ will mean a compact 3-manifold obtained from $\BB^3$ by attaching $g$ solid 1-handles, i.e. $\DD^1 \cross \DD^2$.
These are glued in via two copies of $\bd \DD^1 \cross \DD^2$:

Alternatively, these can be defined as a regular neighborhood of $\Vee_{i=1}^g S^1 \subset \RR^3$.

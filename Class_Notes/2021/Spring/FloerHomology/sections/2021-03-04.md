# Maslov Index Formula (Thursday, March 04)

Recall that for $x,y \ion \TT_ \alpha \intersect \TT_ \beta$, there is a map
\[
\mu: \pi_2(x, y) &\to \ZZ \\
&\mu &= \ind(D \delbar_J)
.\]

This index is the expected dimension of $M(\varphi)$.
The following theorem can be found in the paper "A cylindrical reformulation of Heegard Floer homology":


:::{.theorem title="Lipschitz"}
Let \( x = \ts{ x_1, \cdots, x_g } \)  and \( y = \ts{ y_1, \cdots, y_g } \)  and \( \varphi\in \pi_2(x, y) \).
Then 
\[
\mu( \varphi) = e( D( \varphi) ) + n_x( D( \varphi ) ) + n_y( D( \varphi ) )
.\]
where $e(\wait)$ is the **Euler measure** and $n_x(\cdots), n_y(\cdots)$ is referred to as the **point measure**.
Note that these only depend on the domain of \( \varphi \).

:::{.definition title="Euler Measure"}
Let $D( \varphi) = \sum_{i=1}^m n_{z_i} ( \varphi) D_i$, then
\[
e (D (\varphi)) \da \sum_{i=1}^m n_{z_i}( \varphi) e(D_i) && e(D_i) \da \chi(D_i)
.\]
Here we use the fact that all regions are polygons whose corners occur in one of two types:

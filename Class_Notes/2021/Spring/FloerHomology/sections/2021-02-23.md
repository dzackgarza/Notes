## Whitney Discs 

For $x,y \in \TT_{ \alpha} \intersect \TT_{ \beta}$, recall that we had the following situation:

Then $\pi_2(x, y)$ was defined to be the homotopy classes of discs connecting $x$ to $y$.
The obstruction to the existence of such discs was denoted $\eps(x, y) \in H_1(M)$ for $M\in \Mfd^3$.

## $\Spinc$ Structures and Invariance

Recall that given a Heegard diagram \( ( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z ) \) gives an equivalence relation
\[
x \sim y \iff \eps(x, y) = 0 \in H_1(M) \equalsbecase{PD} H^2(M)
.\]
This yields a decomposition of $\hat{\CF}$ into a direct sum over equivalence classes of subcomplexes defined by $\spinc$ structures.
Note that the differential will preserve each direct summand.
We defined $\spinc(M)$ as the set of nowhere vanishing vector fields on $M$ modulo being homotopic outside finitely many 3-balls in $M$.
We had a map 
\[
\TT_{ \alpha} \intersect \TT_{\beta} \mapsvia{s_z} \spinc(M)
,\]
recalling that the left-hand side are the generators of $\hat{\CF}$.
We took a self-indexing Morse function on $M$, took the inverse image of $3/2$ to get the Heegard surface, and each intersection point $x_i$ gave a flow line from an index 2 critical point to an index 1 critical point passing through $x_i$:

We proceeded by cancelling adjacent flow lines (at the level of vector fields), and then modifying $\gamma_z$ (the flow line passing through the basepoint $z$ connecting the index 0 to the index 3) to get a nowhere vanishing vector field.
We then took a trivialization $\tau: TM \to M \cross\RR^3$ defined a map
\[
\spinc(M) &\mapsvia{\gamma^ \tau} H^2(M) \\
s = [v] &\mapsto f_v^*( \alpha)
.\]
where \( \alpha \) is the volume form of $S^2$ and 
\[
f_v: M &\to S^2 \\
x &\mapsto \hat{v_x} \da { v_x \over \norm{v_x} }
.\]
Note that \( \delta^\tau \) a priori depends on \( \tau \), but 
\[
\delta(s_1, s_2) = \delta^{ \tau}(s_1) - \delta^{ \tau}(s_2) \in H^2(M)
,\]
and the difference is independent of \( \tau \).

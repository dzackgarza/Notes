## $\Spinc$ Structures and Invariance

Recall that given a Heegard diagram \( ( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z ) \) gives an equivalence relation
\[
x \sim y \iff \eps(x, y) = 0 \in H_1(M) \equalsbecase{PD} H^2(M)
.\]
This yields a decomposition of $\hat{\CF}$ into a direct sum over equivalence classes of subcomplexes defined by $\spinc$ structures.
Note that the differential will preserve each direct summand.
We defined $\spinc(M)$ as the set of nowhere vanishing vector fields on $M$ modulo being homotopic outside finitely many 3-balls in $M$.
We had a map 
\[
\TT_{ \alpha} \intersect \TT_{\beta} \mapsvia{s_z} \spinc(M)
,\]
recalling that the left-hand side are the generators of $\hat{\CF}$.
We took a self-indexing Morse function on $M$, took the inverse image of $3/2$ to get the Heegard surface, and each intersection point $x_i$ gave a flow line from an index 2 critical point to an index 1 critical point passing through $x_i$:

Recall that we were working with a diagram for $S^1 \cross S^2$:

![image_2021-03-09-11-14-10](figures/image_2021-03-09-11-14-10.png)

Here we have \( \bd x = 2y = 0 \) since we're working mod 2, and \( \bd y = 0 \), so we have
\[
\hat{\HF}(H_1) = {\ker \bd \over \im \bd} = { \gens{ x, y }\over 1} = (\ZZ/2)^{\oplus 2} 
.\]

However, with a different diagram, we get a different result:


![image_2021-03-09-11-15-46](figures/image_2021-03-09-11-15-46.png)

Here $\hat{\HF}(H_2) = 0$.
To prevent this, we'll have some class of *admissible* diagrams.

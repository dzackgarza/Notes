\todo[inline]{Missing lecture}


:::{.remark}
Today: $L\dash$spaces and the surgery exact triangle.
We've been loosely following [@OS-1], references for upcoming topics include [@OS-2] and Jen Hom's survey [@H].

:::{.remark}
Recall that we were discussing $\HF^-(M, s)$ for $M\in \Mfd^3(\RR)$ and $s$ a $\Spinc$ structure, and if $M\in \QHS$ this decomposes as $\ZZ/2[u] \oplus \qty{\bigoplus_i {\ZZ/2[u] \over \gens{u^{}n_i} }} \da \ZZ/2[u] \oplus \HF_\red(M, s)$.
The Maslov grading of $1$ in the first summand is the **$d\dash$invariant**, $d(M, s)$.
If one defines \( d(M) \da \sum_{s\in \Spinc(M)} d(M, s) \), then $d: \Theta^3_\QQ \to \QQ$ is a group homomorphism.
We want to talk about $X\in \Mfd^3$ which have the "simplest" Floer theory, in the sense that the torsion summand above vanishes.

:::{.definition title="?"}
A manifold $M\in\QHS^3$ is an **$L\dash$space** if $\HF_\red(M, s) = 0$, which happens if and only if $\HF^-(M, s) = \ZZ/2[u]$.

# Morse Homology and Lagrangian Floer Homology (Thursday, January 28)


Last time: defined the Morse complex.
Assumed $(f, g)$ was a Morse-Smale pair, where $f$ is a Morse function and $g$ is a Riemannian metric, and this guarantees that if $p, q\in \crit(f)$ with $\ind(p) - \ind(q) = 1$, then (among other things) there are finitely many gradient trajectories $p\leadsto q$.
We denoted this \( \mathcal{M}(p, q)  \).
The chain complex was defined by $C_i(f, g) \da \bigoplus_{\ind(p) = i} \ZZ_2 \gens{ p }$ with differential $\bd_i: C_i \to C_{i-1}$ was defined by sending an index $i$ critical point $p$ to $\sum_{\ind(q) = i-1} \# \mathcal{M}(p, q) q \mod 2$. 


:::{.theorem title="The Morse Complex is a Chain Complex"}
$\bd_{i} \circ \bd_{i+1} = 0$.
:::

Idea of the proof:
we can directly compute
\[
\bd(\bd p) 
&= \bd \qty{ \sum_{\ind(q) = i-1} \# \mathcal{M}(p, q) q }
&= \sum_{\ind(q) = i-1} \# \mathcal{M}(p, q) \bd q \\
&= \sum_{\ind(q) = i-1} \# \mathcal{M}(p, q) \qty{ \sum_{\ind(r) = i-2 \# \mathcal{M}(q, r) r  }}   \\
&= \sum_{\ind(r) = i-2} \qty{\sum_{\ind(q) = i-1} \# \mathcal{M}(p, q) \# \mathcal{M}(q, r) }  r \\
&= 0 && \text{(claim)}
.\]

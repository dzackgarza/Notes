# Morse Homology and Lagrangian Floer Homology (Thursday, January 28)


Last time: defined the Morse complex.
Assumed $(f, g)$ was a Morse-Smale pair, where $f$ is a Morse function and $g$ is a Riemannian metric, and this guarantees that if $p, q\in \crit(f)$ with $\ind(p) - \ind(q) = 1$, then (among other things) there are finitely many gradient trajectories $p\leadsto q$.
We denoted this \( \mathcal{M}(p, q)  \).

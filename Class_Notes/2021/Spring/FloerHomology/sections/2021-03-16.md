# Maslov Grading and $\spinc$ Structures (Tuesday, March 16)


:::{.remark}
Let $M\in \Mfd^3(\RR)$ be a closed oriented 3-manifold and \( \mathcal{H} = (\Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z)  \) a Heegaard diagram for $M$.
Letting $b_i$ be the Betti numbers, note that $b_1 = 0 \iff M \in \QHS^3$ is a rational homology 3-sphere, i.e. $H_i(M; \QQ) \cong H_i(S^3; \QQ)$ for all $i$.
This also implies that $H_2(M; \ZZ) = 0$.
Under this condition, we can define a *relative $\ZZ\dash$grading* (i.e. we have a difference of grading between any two elements) on $\hat{CF}$ in the following way: for $x, y$ two generators, we set 
\[
\gr(x) - \gr(y) \da \mu( \varphi) -2n_z( \varphi) && \text{for some } \varphi\in \pi_2(x,y)
.\]

Recall that $\mu(\wait)$ denotes the Maslov index, $n_z( \wait)$ is the local multiplicity of a Whitney disc at $z$, and  $x, y$ denote tuples of points.

:::{.remark}
This involves a choice of disc, so why is it well-defined?
We'll also see why we need $M\in \QHS^3$.

:::{.proof title="of well-definedness"}
Let \( \varphi, \varphi' \in \pi_2(x, y) \).
We have 
\[
\phi \ast (-\phi') \in \pi_2(x, x) = \ZZ \oplus H_2(M) = \ZZ \oplus 0
,\]
so this is some multiple $kS$ where $S$ is the positive generator of \( \pi_2\Sym^g \Sigma \).

# Maslov Grading and $\spinc$ Structures (Tuesday, March 16)

:::{.remark}
Let $M\in \Mfd^3(\RR)$ be a closed oriented 3-manifold and \( \mathcal{H} = (\Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z)  \) a Heegaard diagram for $M$.
Letting $b_i$ be the Betti numbers, note that $b_1 = 0 \iff M \in \QHS^3$ is a rational homology 3-sphere, i.e. $H_i(M; \QQ) \cong H_i(S^3; \QQ)$ for all $i$.
This also implies that $H_2(M; \ZZ) = 0$.
Under this condition, we can define a *relative $\ZZ\dash$grading* (i.e. we have a difference of grading between any two elements) on $\hat{CF}$ in the following way: for $x, y$ two generators, we set 
\[
\gr(x) - \gr(y) \da \mu( \varphi) -2n_z( \varphi) && \text{for some } \varphi\in \pi_2(x,y)
.\]

Recall that $\mu(\wait)$ denotes the Maslov index, $n_z( \wait)$ is the local multiplicity of a Whitney disc at $z$, and  $x, y$ denote tuples of points.

This involves a choice of disc, so why is it well-defined?
We'll also see why we need $M\in \QHS^3$.

:::{.proof title="of well-definedness"}
Let \( \varphi, \varphi' \in \pi_2(x, y) \).
We have 
\[
\phi \ast (-\phi') \in \pi_2(x, x) = \ZZ \oplus H_2(M) = \ZZ \oplus 0
,\]
so this is some multiple $kS$ where $S$ is the positive generator of \( \pi_2\Sym^g \Sigma \).
So 
\[
\mu( \varphi \ast (- \varphi') ) = \mu( \varphi) - \mu( \varphi') = k \mu(S) = 2k
.\]
Similarly,
\[
n_z( \varphi \ast (- \varphi')) = n_z( \varphi) - n_z( \varphi') = k n_z(S) = k
,\]
where we've used \( \mu(S) = 2, n_z(S) = 1 \).
Then
\[
\mu( \varphi) - \mu ( \varphi') 
&= 2( n_z( \varphi) - n_z( \varphi') ) \\
\implies
\mu( \varphi) - 2n_z( \varphi) 
&= \mu( \varphi') - 2 n_z( \varphi')
.\]
:::

:::{.remark}
Note that the relative grading is only defined if $\pi_2(x, y) \neq \emptysety \iff \eps(x, y) = 0 \in H_1(M; \ZZ)$.
This generated an equivalence relation of elements in $\TT_{ \alpha} \intersect \TT_{ \beta}$ by $x\sim y \iff \eps(x, y) = 0$, so we have a decomposition
\[
\hat{CF}( \mathcal{H} ) = \bigoplus _{?} \hat{CF}( \mathcal{H}, ?)  
.\]
which is preserved by $\bd$, so $\hat{HF}(\mathcal{H})$ will split similarly as 
\[
\hat{HF}( \mathcal{H} ) = \bigoplus _{?} \hat{CF}( \mathcal{H}, ?)  
.\]

It turns out that the right thing to replace the "?" with will be \( \spinc \) structures.

## $\spinc$ Structures

We'll discuss Turaev's (?) reformulation of $\spinc$ structure for $\Mfd^3$.
Note that $\chi(M) = 0$, so there exists nowhere vanishing vector fields on $M$ by Poincar√©-Hopf.


:::{.definition title="?"}
Let $v_1, v_2$ be nowhere vanishing vector fields on $M$.
We say 
\[
v_1 \sim v_2
\iff \ro{v_1}{M\sm B} \homotopic \ro{v_2}{M\sm B}
,\]
i.e. their restrictions to $M\sm B$ are homotopic, and here $B$ is a 3-ball in $M$.
Equivalently, $v_1\sim v_2 \iff v_1, v_2$ are homotopic in the complement of finitely many 3-balls in $M$.

Recall that we discussed the domains of discs: for \( \varphi\in \varphi_2(x, y) \) we defined the 2-chain \( D( \varphi) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i D_i \) where we've written \( \Phi \sm \alpha\union \beta = \disjoint_{i=1}^m \open{D_i} \) and $a_i$ is the number of points in $\im( \varphi) \intersectL_{z_i}$ for $z_i \in D_i$.

\todo[inline]{Put a circle above the D_i for "open"}

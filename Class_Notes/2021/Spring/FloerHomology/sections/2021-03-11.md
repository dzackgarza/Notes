Recall the example from last time: we are trying to show that changing a diagram by isotopy doesn't change the homology.

Here we have $g=1$ and so \( \Sym^1(T^2) = T^2 \), and \( \alpha \intersect \beta = \ts{ a,b,c,d,e } \).
So \( \hat{\CF}( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z) = \ZZ/2 \gens{ a,b,c,d,e }  \).

First mark the component that contains the base point $z$:

We can make this part bigger, and find that there are only two bigons involving $a$:

So $\bd a = {\color{yellow} b} + {\color{purple} d}$, since we require 90 degree corners.
Similarly, \( \bd e = b + d \)

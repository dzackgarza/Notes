:::{.theorem title="Dedekind, Actuality of ideals"}
If $I$ is a nonzero ideal of $\ZZ_K$ for $K$ a number field, then there is an $\alpha\in \bar{\ZZ}$ such that 
\[
I = (\alpha \bar\ZZ) \intersect \ZZ_K
.\]

:::


:::{.lemma title="?"}
Let $I$ be a nonzero ideal of $\ZZ_K$, then there is an extension of number fields $L/K$ such that $I \ZZ_L$ is principal ,say $I \ZZ_L = \alpha\ZZ_L$.

# Ch. 18: Dirichlet's Units Theorem Part I (Friday, May 21)


:::{.remark}
Some notation introduced last time: for $K$ a number field, $[K: \QQ] = n$ the degree, set $\sigma_{1}, \cdots, \sigma_{r_1}$ to be the real embeddings, and $\sigma_{r_1 + 1}, \cdots, \sigma_{r_1 + r_2}$ (along with their complex conjugates) to be the nonreal embeddings into $\CC$.
Let $\mu_K \da \ts{ z\in K \st z^n = 1, n\in \NN }$ be the $n$th roots of unity
Recall Dirichlet's unit theorem: there are $\elts{\eps}{r_1+r_2-1} \in \ZZ_K\units$ of infinite order such that
\[
\ZZ_K\units = \mu_K \times \prod_{i\leq r_1 + r_2 -1} \gens{ \mu_i } 
.\]
Moreover, $\# \mu_K < \infty$.

:::{.remark title="An outline of the proof so far"}
Set $d = r_1 + r_2$.
We define a homomorphism
\[
\Log: K\units &\to \RR^{d} \\
\alpha &\mapsto \tv{ 
\log\abs{\sigma_i(\alpha)}, 
\cdots,
\log\abs{\sigma_{r_1}(\alpha)}, 
2 \log\abs{\sigma_{r_1+1}(\alpha)}, 
\cdots,
2 \log\abs{\sigma_{r_1+r_2}(\alpha)}, 
}
.\]
Note that we only used half of the non-real embeddings, but made up for it by including a 2!
We'll mostly be concerned with its restriction to $\ZZ_K\units$.


1. Show that the restriction has finite kernel $\mu_k$. Check.

2. Show $\Log(\ZZ_K\units)$ is discrete as a subgroup of $\RR^{d}$

3. Use the fact that every discrete subgroup of $\RR^d$ is a lattice, the $\ZZ\dash$span of linearly independent vectors.


4. Prove the units theorem with $d-1$ replaced by $g = \rank \Log(\ZZ_K\units)$.

5. Deferred to next chapter: show $g = r_1 + r_2 - 1$.

# Ch. 18: Dirichlet's Units Theorem Part I (Friday, May 21)


:::{.remark}
Some notation introduced last time: for $K$ a number field, $[K: \QQ] = n$ the degree, set $\sigma_{1}, \cdots, \sigma_{r_1}$ to be the real embeddings, and $\sigma_{r_1 + 1}, \cdots, \sigma_{r_1 + r_2}$ (along with their complex conjugates) to be the nonreal embeddings into $\CC$.
Let $\mu_K \da \ts{ z\in K \st z^n = 1, n\in \NN }$ be the $n$th roots of unity
Recall Dirichlet's unit theorem: there are $\elts{\eps}{r_1+r_2-1} \in \ZZ_K\units$ of infinite order such that
\[
\ZZ_K\units = \mu_K \times \prod_{i\leq r_1 + r_2 -1} \gens{ \mu_i } 
.\]

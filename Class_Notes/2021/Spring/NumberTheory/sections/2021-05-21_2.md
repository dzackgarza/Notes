# Ch. 20 Continued (Friday, May 21)


:::{.remark}
Goal of Ch.18: prove that units theorem where the rank is left unspecified, and we proved it for $g$ the rank of a certain lattice.
For Ch.20, we want to show $g$ is the right number!
Recall the $\Log: K\units\to \RR^{r_1 + r_2}$ where we take the $\log\abs{\wait}$ of the real embeddings and $2\log\abs{\wait}$ of one of each pair of complex embeddings.
We know $\Log\ZZ_K\units \subseteq \RR^{r_1 + r_2}$ is a lattice of rank $g \leq r_1 + r_2 - 1$, and we want to show equality.
We showed that everything follows if we establish the key lemma: if $c_1, \cdots, c_{r_1 + r_2 - 1} \in \RR$ are not all zero, defin
\[
F(\alpha) \da \tv{c_1, \cdots, c_{r_1 + r_2 - 1}, 0} \cdot \Log(\alpha)
.\]
We want to show there is a sequence of $\alpha\in \ZZ_K$ such that $\abs{F(\alpha)} \to \infty$ with $\abs{N( \alpha)} \leq C_1$ bounded, where $C_1$ doesn't depend on $\alpha$.
We want to make the dot product above large while keeping the norms small while making linear combinations of $\log\abs{\sigma_i( \alpha)}$ large.
The only embeddings that show up are the ones labeled up to $r_1 + r_2 - 1$, since the last component is zero, and we'll show that we can essentially control the image of $\alpha$ under these embeddings while keeping its norm bounded.

Recall the Minkowski embedding realizes $K$ as a subspace of Euclidean space: $\iota: K\to \RR^{r_1} \oplus \CC^{r_2}$ where the first components are the first $r_1$ real embeddings and the latter are the complex embeddings.
Identifying the target with $\RR^n$, we said last time that $\iota(\ZZ_K) \subseteq \RR^n$ is a full rank lattice, so of rank $n$, which thus has a finite nonzero covolume.

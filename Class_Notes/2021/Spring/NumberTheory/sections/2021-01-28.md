Today: Chapter 5, Euclidean quadratics fields.
In a first algebra course, one proces that if $R$ is a Euclidean domain, then the arithmetic of $R$ is very intersting:

- $R$ is a PID, and as a consequence
- $R$ is a UFD



:::{.definition title="Euclidean Domain"}
A domain $R$ is **Euclidean** if and only if there is a function $\varphi R\smz \to \ZZ^{\geq 0}$ such that for all $a,b\in R$ with $b\neq 0$ there are $q, r\in R$ with $a = bq + r$ with $r=0$ or \( \varphi(r) < \varphi(b) \).

Today: Chapter 5, Euclidean quadratics fields.
In a first algebra course, one proces that if $R$ is a Euclidean domain, then the arithmetic of $R$ is very intersting:

- $R$ is a PID, and as a consequence
- $R$ is a UFD



:::{.definition title="Euclidean Domain"}
A domain $R$ is **Euclidean** if and only if there is a function $\varphi R\smz \to \ZZ^{\geq 0}$ such that for all $a,b\in R$ with $b\neq 0$ there are $q, r\in R$ with $a = bq + r$ with $r=0$ or \( \varphi(r) < \varphi(b) \).
\( \varphi \) is referred to as a **Euclidean function**.

:::{.example title="?"}

- For $R=\ZZ$, one can take \( \varphi(\wait) \da \abs{\wait} \).
- $R = F[t]$ for $F$ a field with \( \varphi(\wait) = \deg(\wait) \).
:::


:::{.remark}
Given a number field $K$, does $Z_K$ have nice factorization, i.e. is it a UFD?
Not always, as we saw last time.
If it were Euclidean, then yes!

:::


:::{.question}
Which quadratic fields $K$ have $Z_K$ Euclidean?
:::


:::{.definition title="?"}
If $K$ is a quadratic field, then 

- $K$ is **Euclidean** if and only if $\ZZ_K$ is a Euclidean domain,

- $K$ is **norm-Euclidean** if and only if $\ZZ_K$ is Euclidean with respect to \( \varphi(\wait) \da \abs{N(\wait)} \).

Today: Chapter 5, Euclidean quadratics fields.
In a first algebra course, one proces that if $R$ is a Euclidean domain, then the arithmetic of $R$ is very intersting:

- $R$ is a PID, and as a consequence
- $R$ is a UFD



:::{.definition title="Euclidean Domain"}
A domain $R$ is **Euclidean** if and only if there is a function $\varphi R\smz \to \ZZ^{\geq 0}$ such that for all $a,b\in R$ with $b\neq 0$ there are $q, r\in R$ with $a = bq + r$ with $r=0$ or \( \varphi(r) < \varphi(b) \).
\( \varphi \) is referred to as a **Euclidean function**.

:::{.example title="?"}

- For $R=\ZZ$, one can take \( \varphi(\wait) \da \abs{\wait} \).
- $R = F[t]$ for $F$ a field with \( \varphi(\wait) = \deg(\wait) \).

:::{.remark}
Given a number field $K$, does $Z_K$ have nice factorization, i.e. is it a UFD?
Not always, as we saw last time.
If it were Euclidean, then yes!

:::


:::{.question}
Which quadratic fields $K$ have $Z_K$ Euclidean?
:::


:::{.definition title="Euclidean and Norm-Euclidean Number Fields"}
If $K$ is a quadratic field, then 

- $K$ is **Euclidean** if and only if $\ZZ_K$ is a Euclidean domain,

- $K$ is **norm-Euclidean** if and only if $\ZZ_K$ is Euclidean with respect to \( \varphi(\wait) \da \abs{N(\wait)} \).

:::


:::{.proposition title="?"}
Let $K$ be a quadratic field.
Then $K$ is norm-Euclidean if and only if for all \( \beta\in K \) there is a \( \gamma\in \ZZ_K \) such that \( \abs{ N(\beta- \gamma) } < 1 \).
In other words, $K$ is norm Euclidean if and only if  every element can be approximated by an element in $\ZZ_K$.
:::


:::{.proof title="?"}
$\impliedby$:
Let \( a,b \in \ZZ_k \) with \( b\neq 0 \).
Define \( \beta\da a/b \in K \), then by assumption choose \( \gamma \) such that \( \abs{N({a\over b} - \gamma}< 1  \).
Multiplying both sides by \( N(b) \) and using the fact that $N(\wait), \abs{\wait}$ are multiplicative, we have 
\[
\abs{N(a - b \gamma)} < \abs{N(b)} 
.\]
Then $a = bq + r \da b \gamma + (a - b \gamma)$.

## Norm-Euclidean Imaginary Quadratic Fields

Suppose $K = \QQ( \sqrt{d} )$ with $d<0$ squarefree, so we can write
\[
K = \ts{ a + b \sqrt{d} \st a,b, \in \QQ }
K = \ts{ a + b i\sqrt{\abs{d}} \st a,b, \in \QQ } \subseteq \CC
.\]
Geometrically, this is a dense subset of $\CC$, so it's not easy to draw.
But we can draw $\ZZ_K$ -- what does it look like?
We know that $d=2,3 \mod 4$ then $\ZZ_K = \ts{a + b \sqrt{d} \st a,b,\in \ZZ}$.

# Lecture 4 (Wednesday, January 27)

Today: the failure of unique factorization.
Roughly corresponds to chapter 4: "Paradise Lost"!

Setup: $K$ is a quadratic field, a degree 2 extension of $\QQ$, which can be written as $K = \QQ(\sqrt{d})$ with $d$ squarefree.
Last time, we completely described $\ZZ_K$ (the algebraic integers in $K$):
\[
\ZZ_K = 
\begin{cases}
\ZZ[ \sqrt{d} ] &  d \equiv 2,3 \mod 4
\\
\ZZ\left[{1 + \sqrt{d} \over 2}\right] & d \equiv 1 \mod 4.
\end{cases}
\]
We saw that the second admitted a different description as $\ts{ {a + b \sqrt{d} \over 2}}$ where $a,b$ are either both even or both odd.
Note that we can do interesting arithmetic in $\ZZ_K$, but it's not necessarily well-behaved: $\ZZ_K$ is not always a UFD.
Letting $d=-5$, we have $\ZZ_K = \ZZ[ \sqrt{-5} ]$ where $6$ factors in two ways: $6 = (1 + \sqrt{5} )(1 - \sqrt{-5} ) = (2)(3) = 6$.
Note that this isn't quite enough to show failure of unique factorization, e.g. we can factor $16 = (4)(4) = (2)(8)$.
Here you should check that all 4 factors are irreducible, and that the factors on the right aren't unit multiples of the ones on the left.
For example, $21 = (-7)(-3) = (7)(3)$, but the factors only differ by the unit $-1\in \ZZ\units$.
The key to checking all of those: the **norm map**:
\[
N(a + b \sqrt{-5} ) = (a + b \sqrt{-5} ) (a - \sqrt{-5} ) = a^2 + 5b^2
.\]
where the second factor was the *conjugate*, i.e. the image of the element under the nontrivial element of the Galois group of $K_{/\QQ}$.
If $a + b \sqrt{-5} \in \ZZ_K$, then $N(a + b \sqrt{-5} \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$ and is equal to zero if and only if $a + b \sqrt{-5} = 0$.
Moreover, this is a unit if and only if its norm is 1,
[^why_norm_argument]
i.e. $a^2 + 5b^2 = 1$, which forces $b=0$ and $a=\pm 1$.
So $U(\ZZ[ \sqrt{-5} ] ) = \ts{\pm 1}$.


[^why_norm_argument]: 
$\impliedby$: If the norm is 1, the conjugate is the inverse. 
For the reverse direction, the argument was more complicated, and reduced to showing norms of units are $\pm 1$, and positivity forces it to be $1$.

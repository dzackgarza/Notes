# Lecture 4 (Wednesday, January 27)

Today: the failure of unique factorization.
Roughly corresponds to chapter 4: "Paradise Lost"!

Setup: $K$ is a quadratic field, a degree 2 extension of $\QQ$, which can be written as $K = \QQ(\sqrt{d})$ with $d$ squarefree.
Last time, we completely described $\ZZ_K$ (the algebraic integers in $K$):
\[
\ZZ_K = 
\begin{cases}
\ZZ[ \sqrt{d} ] &  d \equiv 2,3 \mod 4
\\
\ZZ\left[{1 + \sqrt{d} \over 2}\right] & d \equiv 1 \mod 4.
\end{cases}
\]
We saw that the second admitted a different description as $\ts{ {a + b \sqrt{d} \over 2}}$ where $a,b$ are either both even or both odd.

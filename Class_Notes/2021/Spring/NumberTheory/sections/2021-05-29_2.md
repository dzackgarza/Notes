Setup:

- $L/K$ a Galois extension of number fields.
- $P \in \mspec K$
- $Q\in \mspec L$

We saw that $G(L/K)$ acts on the prime ideals above $P$, making all of the $e,f$ values the same, and thus the decomposition into prime ideals in this type of extension is simpler than in a general extension.
We'll look at decomposition and inertia groups today.

Recall that if $Q$ lies above $P$, then the **decomposition group** $D(Q/P)$ is the set of $\sigma\in G(L/K)$ such that $\sigma(Q) = Q$.
Note that $P$ is redundant in this notation, since $Q \intersect \ZZ_K = P$.
Also recall that $\FF_Q \da \ZZ_L/Q$ is the residue field associated to $Q$ and $\ZZ_P \da \ZZ_L/P$ and we view $\FF_P \subseteq \FF_Q$.
Such an extension of finite fields is always Galois, and the Galois groups turn out to be related to the decomposition groups.
For $\sigma \in D(Q/P)$ we defined $\bar\sigma: \FF_Q \to \FF_Q$ where $\alpha \mod Q \mapsto \sigma(\alpha) \mod Q$.
It's easy to check this is well-defined, precisely by the definition of $D(Q/P)$, and turns out to be an automorphism of $\FF_Q$: it must be surjective since everything in $\ZZ_L$ is in the image of $\sigma$ since $\sigma$ was an automorphism of $\ZZ_L$ to begin with.
But then it's a surjective morphism from a finite field to itself, hence an automorphism.

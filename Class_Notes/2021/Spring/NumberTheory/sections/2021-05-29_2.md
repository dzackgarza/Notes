Two recommended resources:

Setup:

- $L/K$ a Galois extension of number fields.
- $P \in \mspec K$
- $Q\in \mspec L$

We saw that $G(L/K)$ acts on the prime ideals above $P$, making all of the $e,f$ values the same, and thus the decomposition into prime ideals in this type of extension is simpler than in a general extension.
We'll look at decomposition and inertia groups today.

Recall that if $Q$ lies above $P$, then the **decomposition group** $D(Q/P)$ is the set of $\sigma\in G(L/K)$ such that $\sigma(Q) = Q$.
Note that $P$ is redundant in this notation, since $Q \intersect \ZZ_K = P$.
Also recall that $\FF_Q \da \ZZ_L/Q$ is the residue field associated to $Q$ and $\ZZ_P \da \ZZ_L/P$ and we view $\FF_P \subseteq \FF_Q$.

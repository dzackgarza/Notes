## Discriminants


:::{.example title="?"}
Suppose \( K = \QQ( \sqrt{d} ) \) where $d$ is squarefree.
What is its discriminant?
We need a $\ZZ\dash$basis of $\ZZ_K$, for $d=2,3 \mod 4$ we can take \( (1, \sqrt{d} ) \).
Then we construct a matrix whose columns are the different embeddings of each entry.
The embeddings here are the identity and complex conjugation, so we get
\[
\Delta_K = \Delta(1, \sqrt{ d} )
= 
\det 
\qty{
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \sqrt{d} 
\\
 1 & -\sqrt{d} 
\end{bmatrix}
}^2
= (-2 \sqrt{d} )^2 = 4d
.\]
If $d = 1 \mod 4$, then we can take a basis $(1, {1 + \sqrt{d} \over 2})$,
and
\[
\Delta_K
=
\qty{
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & {1 + \sqrt{d} \over 2}
\\
1 & {1 - \sqrt{d} \over 2}
\end{bmatrix}
}^2
= (- \sqrt{d} )^2 = d
.\]
So we have
\[
\Delta_K = 

\begin{cases}
d & d = 1 \mod 4 
\\
4d & d = 2,3 \mod 4 .
\end{cases}
.\]

Note that $\Delta_\QQ = 1$ if you trace through the computation.

## Norms of Ideals


:::{.definition title="?"}
Let $I \normal \ZZ_K$ be a nonzero ideal, then define \( N(I) \da \# \ZZ_K/I \).
:::


:::{.remark}
Note that this was finite in the quadratic field case since nonzero ideals had a "standard basis".
For general number fields, the ideals can be more complicated, so we'll need another way to show finiteness.

:::{.lemma title="?"}
Let \( \alpha\in \ZZ_K \), then \( \alpha\divides N( \alpha) \) in \( \ZZ_K \).
:::


:::{.proof title="of lemma"}
Write down the obvious thing and see that it works!
\[
N \alpha 
\da \prod_{ \sigma: K \embeds \CC} \sigma( \alpha) \\
= \alpha \prod_{ \substack{ \sigma: K \embeds \CC \\ \sigma\neq \one_K } } \sigma( \alpha) \\
&\da \alpha C 
,\]
where we've used that one embedding is the identity and factored it out.
So it only remains to show that the *cofactor* $C$ (the product term) is actually in $\ZZ_K$.
It is \( \bar{ZZ} \), since \( \alpha \) was an algebraic integer, i.e. a root of some monic polynomial with integer coefficients.
But then under every embedding, \( \sigma( \alpha) \) is a root of the same monic polynomial, so each \( \sigma( \alpha) \in \bar{\ZZ} \), as is their product since it's a ring.
On the other hand, we can write \( C = N \alpha/ \alpha \).
Since \( N \alpha \) is a nonzero rational integer and \( \alpha\in K \), and since $K$ is a field, this quotient is in $K$.
But then \( C \in \bar{\ZZ} \intersect K = \ZZ_K \).

:::{.proposition title="?"}
For $I\normal \ZZ_K$ nonzero,
\[
N(I) < \infty 
.\]
:::


:::{.proof title="?"}
We start with principal ideals.
Let $m\in \ZZ^+$, then \( \ZZ_K \gens{ m } \da \ZZ_K /m \ZZ_K \cong_{\zmod} \ZZ^n / m\ZZ^n \cong (\ZZ/m\ZZ)^n  \) where we've forgotten the ring structure and are just considering it as a \(\ZZ\dash\)module .
But this has size $m^n < \infty$.

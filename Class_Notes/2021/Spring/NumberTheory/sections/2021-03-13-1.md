# Discriminants (Saturday, March 13)


:::{.example title="?"}
Suppose \( K = \QQ( \sqrt{d} ) \) where $d$ is squarefree.
What is its discriminant?
We need a $\ZZ\dash$basis of $\ZZ_K$, for $d=2,3 \mod 4$ we can take \( (1, \sqrt{d} ) \).
Then we construct a matrix whose columns are the different embeddings of each entry.
The embeddings here are the identity and complex conjugation, so we get
\[
\Delta_K = \Delta(1, \sqrt{ d} )
= 
\det 
\qty{
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \sqrt{d} 
\\
 1 & -\sqrt{d} 
\end{bmatrix}
}^2
.\]

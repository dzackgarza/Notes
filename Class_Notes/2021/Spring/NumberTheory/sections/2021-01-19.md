# Lecture 2 (Tuesday, January 19)

Today: Ch.2 of the book, "Cast of Characters"

Last time: looked at factorization in $\ZZ[\sqrt 2], \ZZ[\sqrt{26}]$. 
Where do rings like this come from?


:::{.definition title="Number Field"}
A **number field** is a subfield $K \subseteq \CC$ such that $[K: \QQ] < \infty$.
:::


:::{.remark}
Some authors don't require $K \subseteq \CC$, but any finite extension of $\QQ$ will embed into $\CC$ so there's no harm in this extra requirement.
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
$\QQ[\sqrt[3]{2}, \QQ[\sqrt 2, \sqrt[5]{7}]$ or $\QQ(\theta)$ where $\theta$ is a root of $x^5 - x - 1$ (which you can check is irreducible.
Now that the round vs. square brackets here won't make a difference, since we're adjoining algebraic numbers.
:::


:::{.proposition title="?"}
Let $K_{/\QQ}$ be a finite extension, say of degree $n\da [K: \QQ]$.
Then there are $n$ distinct embeddings
[^embedding_means]
of $K$ into $\CC$

[^embedding_means]: 
An injective ring morphism.

:::


:::{.proof title="?"}
We have $K_{/\QQ}$, which is necessarily separable since $\ch(\QQ) = 0$.
By the primitive element theorem, we can write $K = \QQ(\theta)$ where \( \theta \) is a root of some degree $n$ irreducible polynomial $f(x) \in \QQ[x]$.
Since $\CC$ is algebraically closed, $f$ splits completely over $\CC$ as \( f = \prod_{i=1}^n (x- \theta_i \) which each \( \theta_i \in CC \) distinct since $f$ was irreducible and we're in characteristic zero.
Then for each $i$ there is an embedding $K = \QQ[\theta]$ given by
\[
K = \QQ[\theta] &\injects \CC \\
g(\theta) &\mapsto g(\theta_i)
.\]

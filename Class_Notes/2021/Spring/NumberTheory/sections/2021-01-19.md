# Lecture 2 (Tuesday, January 19)

Today: Ch.2 of the book, "Cast of Characters"

Last time: looked at factorization in $\ZZ[\sqrt 2], \ZZ[\sqrt{26}]$. 
Where do rings like this come from?


:::{.definition title="Number Field"}
A **number field** is a subfield $K \subseteq \CC$ such that $[K: \QQ] < \infty$.
:::


:::{.remark}
Some authors don't require $K \subseteq \CC$, but any finite extension of $\QQ$ will embed into $\CC$ so there's no harm in this extra requirement.
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
$\QQ[\sqrt[3]{2}, \QQ[\sqrt 2, \sqrt[5]{7}]$ or $\QQ(\theta)$ where $\theta$ is a root of $x^5 - x - 1$ (which you can check is irreducible.
Now that the round vs. square brackets here won't make a difference, since we're adjoining algebraic numbers.
:::


:::{.proposition title="?"}
Let $K_{/\QQ}$ be a finite extension, say of degree $n\da [K: \QQ]$.
Then there are $n$ distinct embeddings
[^embedding_means]
of $K$ into $\CC$

[^embedding_means]: 
An injective ring morphism.

:::


:::{.proof title="?"}
We have $K_{/\QQ}$, which is necessarily separable since $\ch(\QQ) = 0$.
By the primitive element theorem, we can write $K = \QQ(\theta)$ where \( \theta \) is a root of some degree $n$ irreducible polynomial $f(x) \in \QQ[x]$.
Since $\CC$ is algebraically closed, $f$ splits completely over $\CC$ as \( f = \prod_{i=1}^n (x- \theta_i \) which each \( \theta_i \in CC \) distinct since $f$ was irreducible and we're in characteristic zero.
Then for each $i$ there is an embedding $K = \QQ[\theta]$ given by
\[
\iota_i: \QQ[\theta] &\injects \CC \\
g(\theta) &\mapsto g(\theta_i)
.\]
There are some easy things to check:

- This is well-defined: elements in $K$ are polynomials in \( \theta \) but they all differ by a multiple of the minimal polynomial of \( \theta \),
- This is an inject homomorphism and thus an embedding, and
- For distinct $i$ you get distinct embeddings: just look at the image $\iota_i(\theta)$, these are distinct numbers in $\CC$.

:::


:::{.definition title="Real and Nonreal embeddings"}
Let $K_{/\QQ}$ be a finite extension of degree $n = [K : \QQ]$.
We'll say an embedding \( \sigma:K \to \CC \) is **real** if \( \sigma(K) \subseteq \RR \) , otherwise we'll say the embedding is **nonreal**.
:::


:::{.remark}
If \( \sigma \) is a nonreal, then \( \bar \sigma \) is a nonreal embedding, so this embeddings come in pairs.
As a consequence, the total number of embeddings is given by $n = r_1 + 2r_2$, where $r_1$ is the number of real embeddings and $r_2$ is the number of nonreal embeddings.
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
Let $K = \QQ(\sqrt[3]{2})$.
Here $n=3$ since this is the root of a degree 3 irreducible polynomial.
Using the proof we can find the embeddings: factor 
\[
x^3 - 2 = (x - \sqrt[3]{2})(x - \omega \sqrt[3]{2}) (x - \omega^2 \sqrt[3]{2})
.\]
where \( \omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} \) is a complex cube root of unity.
We can form an embedding by sending $\sqrt[3]{2} \to \omega^j \sqrt[3]{2}$ for $j=0,1,2$.
The case $j=0$ sends $K$ to a subset of $\RR$ and yields a real embedding, but the other two will be nonreal. 
So $r_1 = 1, r_2 = 1$, and we have $3 = 1 + 2(1)$ and this is consistent.
:::

We've only been talking about fields, since unique factorization is trivial since there are no primes.
There are thus "too many" units, compared to the rings we were considering before.

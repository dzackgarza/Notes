# Lecture 2 (Tuesday, January 19)

Today: Ch.2 of the book, "Cast of Characters"

Last time: looked at factorization in $\ZZ[\sqrt 2], \ZZ[\sqrt{26}]$. 
Where do rings like this come from?


:::{.definition title="Number Field"}
A **number field** is a subfield $K \subseteq \CC$ such that $[K: \QQ] < \infty$.

:::{.remark}
Some authors don't require $K \subseteq \CC$, but any finite extension of $\QQ$ will embed into $\CC$ so there's no harm in this extra requirement.

## Ch. 14 Continued: Cyclotomic Fields 


:::{.definition title="Cyclotomic Fields"}
A **cyclotomic field** is a number field $\QQ( \zeta_m)$ where \( \zeta_m \da e^{2\pi i / m} \), a primitive $m$th root of 1.

:::{.remark}
The Kronecker-Webber theorem: any *abelian extension* $K/\QQ$ (so $\Gal(K/\QQ) \in \Ab$) is contained in a cyclotomic extension, and every cyclotomic field is an abelian extension.
Given such a number field $K$, what is $\ZZ_K$?

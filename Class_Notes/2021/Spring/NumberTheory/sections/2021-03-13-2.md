## Ch. 14 Continued: Cyclotomic Fields 

:::{.definition title="Cyclotomic Fields"}
A **cyclotomic field** is a number field $\QQ( \zeta_m)$ where \( \zeta_m \da e^{2\pi i / m} \), a primitive $m$th root of 1.
:::

:::{.remark}
The Kronecker-Webber theorem: any *abelian extension* $K/\QQ$ (so $\Gal(K/\QQ) \in \Ab$) is contained in a cyclotomic extension, and every cyclotomic field is an abelian extension.
Given such a number field $K = \QQ( \zeta_m)$, what is $\ZZ_K$?
:::

:::{.theorem title="?"}
For $K = \QQ( \zeta_m)$,
\[
\ZZ_K = \ZZ[ \zeta_m ]
.\]
:::

:::{.remark}
The degree of any such $K/\QQ$ is $\phi(m)$, and here $\phi(p) = p-1$.
Also recall Eisenstein's criterion: if $p$ divides all of the coefficients of a polynomial $f(x) \da \sum a_i x^i$ but $p^2\notdivides a_0$, then $f$ is irreducible over $\QQ$.
:::

:::{.lemma title="?"}
The minimal polynomial of $\zeta_p$ over $\QQ$ is 
\[
\Phi_p(x) \da x^{p-1} + x^{p-2} + \cdots + x + 1
,\]
and so $[\QQ (\zeta_p) : \QQ] = p-1$.
:::

:::{.proof title="sketch"}
Note that $\zeta_p$ is a root of $\Phi_p$, since
\[
\Phi_p(x) = {x^p-1 \over x - 1}
,\]
and $\zeta_p$ is a root of the numerator of the right-hand side and not of the denominator.
This is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion at $p$, using $x\mapsto x+1$.
:::

:::{.proposition title="?"}
Let \( \alpha\in \bar{\ZZ} \) be an algebraic integer such that
\[
\min_ \alpha (x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0 && \in \ZZ[x]
\]
is Eisenstein at the prime $p$.
Let $K \da \QQ( \alpha)$, a number field of degree $n$.
Then 
\[
p\notdivides [\ZZ_K : \ZZ[ \alpha] ]
.\]
:::


:::{.proof title="?"}
We first observe that \( \alpha^n \) is a multiple of $p$ in $\ZZ_K$.
To see this, plug \( \alpha \) into the minimal polynomial to get $0 = \alpha^n + \cdots$ and solve for \( \alpha^n \) to obtain
\[
\alpha^n = -(a_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 \alpha + a_0) \equiv 0 \mod p \text{ in } \ZZ_K 
,\]
and this is a multiple of $p$ by the assumption on Eisenstein's criterion.
We want to show $p$ doesn't divide $\# \ZZ_K/ \ZZ[ \alpha]$ as \(\ZZ\dash\)modules, identify the index as the size of this quotient.
It suffices to show that $\ZZ_K/\ZZ[ \alpha]$ has no elements of order $p$, by applying Cauchy's theorem.
If \( \beta\in \ZZ_K \) represents an element of order $p$ in the quotient, then \( p \beta\in \ZZ[ \alpha] \) and so \( p \beta = b_0 + b \alpha + \cdots + b_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1} \) for some $b_i \in \ZZ$.
The order of \( \beta \) to be exactly $p$, so not all of the \( b_i \) are multiples of $p$: otherwise one could divide through by $p$ and conclude \( \beta\in \ZZ[ \alpha] \), making it zero in the quotient (and in particular, not of order $p$ as assumed).
Suppose toward a contradiction that $i$ is the smallest index such that $p$ does not divide $b_i$.
Then take this last equation mod $p$:
\[
p \beta \equiv 0 \equiv b_i \alpha^{i} + \cdots + b_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1} \mod p
.\]
Now multiply by \( \alpha^{n-1-i} \) to obtain
\[
0 \equiv b_i \alpha^{n-1} + \cdots \equiv b_i \alpha^{n-1} \mod p
,\]
where $p$ divides all of the other terms since they all contain a factor of \( \alpha^n \equiv 0 \mod p\).
So \( b_i \alpha^{n-1} /p \in \ZZ_K \), and by a previous theorem, this forces \( N( b_i \alpha^{n-1} / p ) \in |ZZ \).

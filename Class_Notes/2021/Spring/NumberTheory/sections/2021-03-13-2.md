## Ch. 14 Continued: Cyclotomic Fields 

:::{.definition title="Cyclotomic Fields"}
A **cyclotomic field** is a number field $\QQ( \zeta_m)$ where \( \zeta_m \da e^{2\pi i / m} \), a primitive $m$th root of 1.
:::

:::{.remark}
The Kronecker-Webber theorem: any *abelian extension* $K/\QQ$ (so $\Gal(K/\QQ) \in \Ab$) is contained in a cyclotomic extension, and every cyclotomic field is an abelian extension.
Given such a number field $K = \QQ( \zeta_m)$, what is $\ZZ_K$?
:::

:::{.theorem title="The ring of integers of a cyclotomic field is given by adjoining a primitive root of unity"}
For $K = \QQ( \zeta_m)$,
\[
\ZZ_K = \ZZ[ \zeta_m ]
.\]
:::

:::{.remark}
The degree of any such $K/\QQ$ is $\phi(m)$, and here $\phi(p) = p-1$.
Also recall Eisenstein's criterion: if $p$ divides all of the coefficients of a polynomial $f(x) \da \sum a_i x^i$ but $p^2\notdivides a_0$, then $f$ is irreducible over $\QQ$.
:::

:::{.lemma title="?"}
The minimal polynomial of $\zeta_p$ over $\QQ$ is 
\[
\Phi_p(x) \da x^{p-1} + x^{p-2} + \cdots + x + 1
,\]
and so $[\QQ (\zeta_p) : \QQ] = p-1$.
:::

:::{.proof title="sketch"}
Note that $\zeta_p$ is a root of $\Phi_p$, since
\[
\Phi_p(x) = {x^p-1 \over x - 1}
,\]
and $\zeta_p$ is a root of the numerator of the right-hand side and not of the denominator.
This is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion at $p$, using $x\mapsto x+1$.
:::

:::{.proposition title="?"}
Let \( \alpha\in \bar{\ZZ} \) be an algebraic integer such that
\[
\min_ \alpha (x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0 && \in \ZZ[x]
\]
is Eisenstein at the prime $p$.
Let $K \da \QQ( \alpha)$, a number field of degree $n$.
Then 
\[
p\notdivides [\ZZ_K : \ZZ[ \alpha] ]
.\]
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
We first observe that \( \alpha^n \) is a multiple of $p$ in $\ZZ_K$.
To see this, plug \( \alpha \) into the minimal polynomial to get $0 = \alpha^n + \cdots$ and solve for \( \alpha^n \) to obtain
\[
\alpha^n = -(a_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 \alpha + a_0) \equiv 0 \mod p \text{ in } \ZZ_K 
,\]
and this is a multiple of $p$ by the assumption on Eisenstein's criterion.
We want to show $p$ doesn't divide $\# \ZZ_K/ \ZZ[ \alpha]$ as \(\ZZ\dash\)modules, identify the index as the size of this quotient.
It suffices to show that $\ZZ_K/\ZZ[ \alpha]$ has no elements of order $p$, by applying Cauchy's theorem.
If \( \beta\in \ZZ_K \) represents an element of order $p$ in the quotient, then \( p \beta\in \ZZ[ \alpha] \) and so \( p \beta = b_0 + b \alpha + \cdots + b_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1} \) for some $b_i \in \ZZ$.
The order of \( \beta \) to be exactly $p$, so not all of the \( b_i \) are multiples of $p$: otherwise one could divide through by $p$ and conclude \( \beta\in \ZZ[ \alpha] \), making it zero in the quotient (and in particular, not of order $p$ as assumed).
Suppose toward a contradiction that $i$ is the smallest index such that $p$ does not divide $b_i$.
Then take this last equation mod $p$:
\[
p \beta \equiv 0 \equiv b_i \alpha^{i} + \cdots + b_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1} \mod p
.\]
Now multiply by \( \alpha^{n-1-i} \) to obtain
\[
0 \equiv b_i \alpha^{n-1} + \cdots \equiv b_i \alpha^{n-1} \mod p
,\]
where $p$ divides all of the other terms since they all contain a factor of \( \alpha^n \equiv 0 \mod p\).
So \( b_i \alpha^{n-1} /p \in \ZZ_K \), and by a previous theorem, this forces \( N( b_i \alpha^{n-1} / p ) \in |ZZ \).
But we can write 
\[
N \qty{ b_i \alpha^{n-1} \over p }
&=
N \qty{ b_i \over p} N( \alpha^{n-1} ) \\
&= \qty{b_i \over p}^{n} N( \alpha)^{n-1} \\
&= \qty{b_i \over p}^{n} \pm a_0 \\
&= \pm {b_i^n a_0^{n-1} \over p^n } \not\in \ZZ
.\]
where we've used that all embeddings fix rational numbers.
But this is not an integer, since by Eisenstein $p^2$ does not divide $a_0$.
So $a_0^{n-1}$ contributes exactly $n-1$ copies of $p$, leaving a $p$ in the denominator, and $p\notdivides b_i$ since we choose $i$ precisely to arrange for this.

:::{.remark}
Recall some facts about the discriminant: let $F$ be a field and $f(x) \in F[x]$ monic.
Then factor $f(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n (x - \alpha_i)$ over some splitting field.
We then define 
\[
\discriminant(f) \da \prod_{i<j} ( \alpha_j - \alpha_i)^2
.\]
We won't discuss the theory, but we'll use a few facts.
:::

:::{.fact}
For each fixed $n$ and all polynomials $f$ of degree $n$, $\discriminant(f)$ is given by a universal polynomial in the coefficients of $f$ with integer coefficients.
For example, for $n=2$ and $f(x) = x^2 + bx + c$, we have \( \discriminant(f) = b^2 - 4c \in \ZZ[b,c] \).
If $n=3$ and $f(x) = x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, we have
\[
\discriminant(f) = 18bcd - 4b^3d + b^2c^2 - 4c^3 - 27d^2\in \ZZ[b,c,d]
.\]
So the discriminant is some polynomial expression in the coefficients, which (more importantly) have *integer* coefficients.

Some consequences:

- \( \discriminant(f) \in F \), despite the fact that the roots are generally not in $F$ and are instead in some splitting field.
- If $F =\QQ$ and $f\in \QQ[x]$ *and* in fact $f\in \ZZ[x]$, then \( \discriminant(f) \in \ZZ \).
- If $F = \QQ$ and $f\in \ZZ[x]$ with $q$ some prime,
\[
\discriminant( f) \mod q = \discriminant(f \mod q)
,\]
  where we first take the discriminant to land in $\ZZ$ and then reduce to $\FF_q$, or we reduce $f\in \ZZ[x]$ to $f\mod q \in \FF_q[x]$ and take the discriminant using some algebraic close of $\FF_q$.

:::


:::{.proof title="That $\ZZ_K = \ZZ[ \zeta_p]$ for $K = \QQ(\zeta_p)$"}
To save space, we'll write $\zeta \da \zeta_p$.
We want to show \( \1, \zeta, \cdots, \zeta^{p-2} \) forms an integral basis, from last time we have
\[
\discriminant( 1, \zeta, \cdots, \zeta^{p-2}) = 
\discriminant_K 
[\ZZ_K : \ZZ[ \zeta ] ]^2 
\implies
[\ZZ_K : \ZZ[ \zeta ] ]^2 
\divides
\discriminant( 1, \zeta, \cdots, \zeta^{p-2}) 
.\]

:::{.claim}
The right-hand side is a power of $p$ (up to a sign), and hence so is the left-hand side.
:::

We'll proceed by showing that the only prime that could divide the right-hand side is $p$.
Suppose $q$ divides the right-hand side, i.e. $q \divides \discriminant(x^{p-1} + \cdots + x + 1)$.
So this is zero mod $q$, and thus $\discriminant( x^{p-1} + \cdots + x + 1 \mod q) \equiv 0$.
The discriminant was a product of roots, so it can only be zero if two roots coincide, so there is a multiple root of $x^{p-1} + \cdots + x + 1 \mod q$ and thus also of $x^p - 1$.
So $x^p-1$ and its derivative $px^{p-1}$ have a root in common, and (check!) this can only happen if $q=p$.

So $[\ZZ_K : \ZZ[\zeta] ] = p^\ell$ for some $\ell$.
Using that fact that $\ZZ[ \zeta] \cong \ZZ[ \zeta - 1]$, we have \( [ \ZZ_K : \ZZ[ \zeta] ] = [ \ZZ_K: \ZZ[\zeta - 1] ] \).

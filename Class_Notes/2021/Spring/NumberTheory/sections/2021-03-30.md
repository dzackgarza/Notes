## Chapter 15 (continued)

:::{.remark}
We want to develop theorems of ideal theory for $\ZZ_K$ for $K$ a general number field, i.e. factorization into prime ideals and the finiteness of the class group.
The strategy:

- Prove $\Cl(\ZZ_K)$ is a finite monoid,
- Prove $\Cl(\ZZ_K)$ has inverses and is thus a group, i.e. every nonzero ideal can be multiplied by another ideal to become principle (principle multiple lemma),
- Run proofs/corollaries as before.

Last time, we proved the first one.

:::{.lemma title="?"}
Let $I, J \in \Id(\ZZ)_K$, then if $IJ = J$ then $I = \gens{ 1 }$.

Note that this is a special case of cancellation.
To prove this, we'll use that $\ZZ_K$ is Noetherian, i.e. every ideal is finitely generated as a \(\ZZ_K\dash\)module.
In fact, $\ZZ_K \cong \ZZ^n$, so any ideal is free of rank $\leq n$ as a \(\ZZ\dash\)module, hence finitely generated as a \(\ZZ\dash\)module, hence finitely-generated as a $\ZZ_K\dash$module since one can use the same generators.

:::{.proof title="?"}
Let $J = \gens{ \beta_1, \cdots, \beta_n }$, then since $IJ = J$, for every $j$ we can write \( \beta_j = \sum_{i=1}^m A_{ij} \beta_i  \).
This means that there is some matrix $A\in \Mat(m\times m, I)$ with entries $A_{ij} \in I$ such that
\[
\tv{\beta_1, \cdots, \beta_m}
=
\tv{\beta_1, \cdots, \beta_m}A
.\]
Then $A-\one \vector{\beta} = 0$, making $A-\one$ singular since not all of the $\beta_i$ were zero since they were generators of a nonzero ideal.

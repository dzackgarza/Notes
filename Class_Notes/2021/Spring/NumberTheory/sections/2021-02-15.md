# Chapter 8: Units in $\ZZ_K$ (Monday, February 15)

Last time:
A discrete subgroup \( \Lambda \leq \RR \) is either $0$ or infinite cyclic, where *discrete* meant finite intersection with every interval $[-x, x]$.



:::{.proof title="?"}
Suppose \( \Lambda \neq 0 \), then we can choose a smallest positive element \( \alpha\in \Lambda \).
Why does this exist? 
There are only finitely many elements in $[0, \alpha]$, so there is a smallest, and we could replace \( \alpha \) with it.

# Chapter 8: Units in $\ZZ_K$ (Monday, February 15)

Last time:
A discrete subgroup \( \Lambda \leq \RR \) is either $0$ or infinite cyclic, where *discrete* meant finite intersection with every interval $[-x, x]$.



:::{.proof title="?"}
Suppose \( \Lambda \neq 0 \), then we can choose a smallest positive element \( \alpha\in \Lambda \).
Why does this exist? 
There are only finitely many elements in $[0, \alpha]$, so there is a smallest, and we could replace \( \alpha \) with it.
The claim is that \( \Lambda = \ZZ \alpha \).
The reverse containment is clear because the RHS is necessarily a subgroup.
Toward a contradiction, suppose there is some \( \beta\in \Lambda\sm \ZZ \alpha \) with \( n \alpha < \beta < (n+1) \alpha \) for some $n\in \ZZ$.
This can't happen: subtracting $n$ from both sides yields 
\[
0 < \beta - n \alpha < \alpha
,\]
where the middle term is necessarily in \( \Lambda \), contradicting minimality of \( \alpha \).

Recall that to show the theorem we wanted, it was enough to show $\log U(\ZZ_K)^+$ is an infinite cyclic subgroup of $\GG_a(\RR)$.
We proved that this was a discrete subgroup.
If this were just the zero element, the only possible units would be $\pm 1$, so it suffices to find a unit \( \epsilon \in U(\ZZ_K) \) with \( \epsilon>0 \) and \( \epsilon\neq 1 \).

### Aside on Diophantine approximation

Let \( \alpha\in \RR \) and let \( Q \in \ZZ^+ \).
How well can we approximate \( \alpha \) with a fraction with denominator bounded by $Q$?

:::{.theorem title="Dirichlet"}
There is a $q \leq Q \in \ZZ^+$ with 
\[ 
\norm{q \alpha } \leq {1 \over Q+1} 
,\] 
where \( \norm{\wait} \) denotes the distance to the nearest integer.

:::{.remark}
The way to think about this inequality: if the LHS is close to an integer $p$, then \( \alpha \) is close to \( p/q \).

:::




:::{.proof title="?"}
Chop the interval into $Q+1$ pieces, and think of the inequality as a condition on the fractional part of \( \alpha \), denoted \( \fractional{ qa } \da qa - \floor{ qa }\in [0, 1) \).
Note that if \( \fractional{ qa } \in [0, 1/Q+1)\) or \( [Q/Q+1, Q) \) for some $q$, then we are done.
If not, it must land in one of the $q-1$ middle intervals 
\[
[1/Q+1, 2/Q+1), 
[2/Q+1, 3/Q+1), 
\cdots,
[Q-1/Q+1, Q/Q+1)
.\]

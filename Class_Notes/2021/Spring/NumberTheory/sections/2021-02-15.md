# Chapter 8: Units in $\ZZ_K$ (Monday, February 15)

Last time:
A discrete subgroup \( \Lambda \leq \RR \) is either $0$ or infinite cyclic, where *discrete* meant finite intersection with every interval $[-x, x]$.



:::{.proof title="?"}
Suppose \( \Lambda \neq 0 \), then we can choose a smallest positive element \( \alpha\in \Lambda \).
Why does this exist? 
There are only finitely many elements in $[0, \alpha]$, so there is a smallest, and we could replace \( \alpha \) with it.
The claim is that \( \Lambda = \ZZ \alpha \).
The reverse containment is clear because the RHS is necessarily a subgroup.
Toward a contradiction, suppose there is some \( \beta\in \Lambda\sm \ZZ \alpha \) with \( n \alpha < \beta < (n+1) \alpha \) for some $n\in \ZZ$.
This can't happen: subtracting $n$ from both sides yields 
\[
0 < \beta - n \alpha < \alpha
,\]
where the middle term is necessarily in \( \Lambda \), contradicting minimality of \( \alpha \).

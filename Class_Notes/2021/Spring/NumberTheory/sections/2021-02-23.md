# Chapter 11: Prime Producing Polynomials and Unique Factorization (Tuesday, February 23)

18th century observation by Euler about the following polynomial:
\[
f(x) \da x^2 -x + 41 
.\]
Goldbach proved that it's impossible for any polynomial $g\in \ZZ[x]$ to have *every* output prime.
Euler noted that this $f$ produces quite a few: for $x=1, \cdots, 40$, the output $f(x)$ is prime, but $f(41) = 41^2 - 41 + 41 = 41^2$ is not.
Let's define a variant: for $q$ a positive integer, set
\[
f_q(x) \da x^2 - x + q
.\]
Note that $f_q(q) = q^2$, so eventually the output is composite.

# Chapter 11: Prime Producing Polynomials and Unique Factorization (Tuesday, February 23)

18th century observation by Euler about the following polynomial:
\[
f(x) \da x^2 -x + 41 
.\]
Goldbach proved that it's impossible for any polynomial $g\in \ZZ[x]$ to have *every* output prime.
Euler noted that this $f$ produces quite a few: for $x=1, \cdots, 40$, the output $f(x)$ is prime, but $f(41) = 41^2 - 41 + 41 = 41^2$ is not.
Let's define a variant: for $q$ a positive integer, set
\[
f_q(x) \da x^2 - x + q
.\]
Note that $f_q(q) = q^2$, so eventually the output is composite.
We'll say $f_q$ is **optimal** if $f_q(x)$ is prime for all integers $0 < x < q$.
As an example, $q=41$ was optimal.


:::{.theorem title="Rabonowitch"}
Let $q \geq 2 \in \ZZ^{> 0}$ and let $d = \Delta(f_q) = 1-4q$ be the discriminant of $f_q$.
Assume that $d$ is squarefree, then $f_q$ is optimal if and only if $\zadjoin{ {1 + \sqrt{d}\over 2 }}$ is a UFD.

Note that this is equal to $\ZZ_K$ when $K\da \QQ( \sqrt{d} )$.

:::{.example title="?"}
For $q=41, d = -163$ and thus $\zadjoin{ {1 + \sqrt{-163} \over 2}}$ is a UFD.

The forward direction is harder here.

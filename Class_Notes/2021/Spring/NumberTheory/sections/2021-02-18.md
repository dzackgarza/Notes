Last time: we defined an equivalence relation on nonzero ideals of $\ZZ_K$, namely \( I \approx J \iff I = \alpha J \) for some \( \alpha \in K\units \).
We then defined the **class group**
\[
\Cl(\ZZ_K) \da \Id(\ZZ_K) / \approx
.\]
We saw that ideal multiplication descends to a well-defined group structure on ideal classes. 
Since ideal multiplication is commutative, this is an abelian group, and moreover it is finite.

:::{.example title="Computing the Class Group"}
Let $K = \QQ(d)$ where \( d \da \sqrt{ -5 } \).
We saw that every ideal class is represented by an element with bounded norm.
Applying it to this specific value of $d$, every element is represented by $[I]$ where \( N(I) \leq 6 \).
If we have such an ideal, it will factor into primes, and thus the class will factor into prime classes. 
Thus the group is actually *generated* by prime ideals of norm at most 6.
Any such ideal will lie above a prime $p \leq 6$, so $p=2,3,5$.
We saw
\[
\gens{ 2 } = P_1^2 && P_1 \da \gens{ 2, 1 + \sqrt{-5} } \\
\gens{ 3 } = P_2 P_3 && P_2 \da \gens{ 3, 1 + \sqrt{-5} },\, P_3 \da \gens{ 3, 1 - \sqrt{-5} }    \\
\gens{ 5 } = P_4^2 && P_4 \da \gens{ \sqrt{-5} }.  
.\]
We conclude that \( \Cl(\ZZ_K) = \gens{ P_1, \cdots, P_4 }  \).
What are the relations?
Consider $P_4$, and note that $\gens{ \sqrt{-5} } \approx  \gens{ 1 }$ since \( P_4 = \sqrt{-5} \gens{ 1 }  \). 
A similar argument works for any principal ideal, and we can throw out $P_4$.
Consider $P_2$ and $P_3$.
Since \( \gens{ 3 } \approx \gens{ 1 }   \), we have $P_2 = P_3 \inv$, so we can also throw out $P_2$, since we don't need to include the inverse of a generator.
Recall that there is a factorization
\[
\gens{ 1 - \sqrt{-5} } 
=
\gens{ 2, 1 - \sqrt{-5} } 
\gens{ 3, 1 - \sqrt{-5} }  
= P_1 P_3
\]
and so these are inverses and we can get rid of $P_3$.
So \( \Cl(\ZZ_K) = \gens{ [P_1] } \), which is a cyclic group.
The generator has to have order 1 or 2, since $P_1^2 = \gens{ 1 }$. 
The claim is that the order is 2: otherwise, it would be trivial, making the class group trivial, which would imply that $\ZZ_K$ is a PID.
Why?
This implies that every $I \in \Id(\ZZ_K)$ is dilation equivalent to the unit ideal, so $I = \alpha \gens{ 1 }$ for some \( \alpha\in K\units \). 
But since $I$ is an ideal in $\ZZ_K$, this forces \( \alpha\in \ZZ_K \) and $I = \gens{ \alpha }$.

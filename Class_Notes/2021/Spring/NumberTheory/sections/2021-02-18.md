Last time: we defined an equivalence relation on nonzero ideals of $\ZZ_K$, namely \( I \approx J \iff I = \alpha J \) for some \( \alpha \in K\units \).
We then defined the **class group**
\[
\Cl(\ZZ_K) \da \Id(\ZZ_K) / \approx
.\]
We saw that ideal multiplication descends to a well-defined group structure on ideal classes. 
Since ideal multiplication is commutative, this is an abelian group, and moreover it is finite.

Let $K = \QQ(d)$ where \( d \da \sqrt{ -5 } \).
We saw that every ideal class is represented by an element with bounded norm.
Applying it to this specific value of $d$, every element is represented by $[I]$ where \( N(I) \leq 6 \).
If we have such an ideal, it will factor into primes, and thus the class will factor into prime classes. 
Thus the group is actually *generated* by prime ideals of norm at most 6.
Any such ideal will lie above a prime $p \leq 6$, so $p=2,3,5$.
We saw
\[
\gens{ 2 } = P_1^2 && P_1 \da \gens{ 2, 1 + \sqrt{-5} } \\
\gens{ 3 } = P_2 P_3 && P_2 \da \gens{ 3, 1 + \sqrt{-5} },\, P_3 \da \gens{ 3, 1 - \sqrt{-5} }    \\
\gens{ 5 } = P_4^2 && P_4 \da \gens{ \sqrt{-5} }.  
.\]
We conclude that \( \Cl(\ZZ_K) = \gens{ P_1, \cdots, P_4 }  \).
What are the relations?
Consider $P_4$, and note that $\gens{ \sqrt{-5} } \approx  \gens{ 1 }$ since \( P_4 = \sqrt{-5} \gens{ 1 }  \). 
A similar argument works for any principal ideal, and we can throw out $P_4$.
Consider $P_2$ and $P_3$.
Since \( \gens{ 3 } \approx \gens{ 1 }   \), we have $P_2 = P_3 \inv$, so we can also throw out $P_2$, since we don't need to include the inverse of a generator.
Recall that there is a factorization
\[
\gens{ 1 - \sqrt{-5} } 
=
\gens{ 2, 1 - \sqrt{-5} } 
\gens{ 3, 1 - \sqrt{-5} }  
= P_1 P_3
\]
and so these are inverses and we can get rid of $P_3$.
So \( \Cl(\ZZ_K) = \gens{ [P_1] } \), which is a cyclic group.
The generator has to have order 1 or 2, since $P_1^2 = \gens{ 1 }$. 
The claim is that the order is 2: otherwise, it would be trivial, making the class group trivial, which would imply that $\ZZ_K$ is a PID.
Why?
This implies that every $I \in \Id(\ZZ_K)$ is dilation equivalent to the unit ideal, so $I = \alpha \gens{ 1 }$ for some \( \alpha\in K\units \). 
But since $I$ is an ideal in $\ZZ_K$, this forces \( \alpha\in \ZZ_K \) and $I = \gens{ \alpha }$. 
This is a contradiction, since every PID is a UFD, and \( \QQ( \sqrt{-5} ) \) has non-unique factorization.
So we can write \( \Cl(\ZZ_K) \cong \GG_a(\ZZ/2\ZZ) \).

What is the class group useful for?
We'll tie this into Diophantine equations.

:::{.example title="?"}
Solve the following equation in $\ZZ$:
\[
y^2 + 5 = x^3
.\]
Recall that we originally tried to do this by factoring the left-hand side and appealing to unique factorization in a number field to deduce that various factors were powers.
However, we don't have unique factorization.
Although we can write \( ( y + \sqrt{-5} ) (y - \sqrt{-5} ) = x^3 \), it's not clear that this is helpful.
The fix will be to go to $\Id(\ZZ_K)$, which does have unique factorization, where we'll also be able to use facts about the class group.
We can turn this into an equation in ideals:
\[
\gens{ y + \sqrt{-5} }  
\gens{ y - \sqrt{-5} }  
= 
\gens{ x }^3 && \in \Id(\ZZ[\sqrt{-5} ]) 
.\]
The original strategy was to show the left-hand factors were coprime in order to deduce they were both cubes.
We'll try to show these ideals are coprime in the monoid sense, then since their product is a cube they'll have to be cubes.
This uses the fact that this is a reduced unique factorization monoid, so being a cube up to a unit is not something we have to worry about here.
We need to show that there's no common prime ideal that divides both factors, using unique factorization.
Suppose toward a contradiction that $P$ is prime and divides both.
Using that ideal norms are multiplicative, $N(P) \divides N( \gens{ y + \sqrt{-5} }) = y^2 + 5$. 
We also know $P$ contains both factors, so it contains $(y + \sqrt{-5} ) - (y - \sqrt{-5} ) = 2 \sqrt{-5}$, so $N(P) \divides N( \gens{ 2 \sqrt{-5} } ) = 20$. 
Thus $N(P) \divides \gcd(y^2 + 5, 20)$ in $\ZZ$.
This is impossible!
The claim is that $y$ is necessarily even for the original equation to be true.
If $y$ is odd, take the equation $\mod 8$: an odd squared is $1\mod 8$, so $y^2 +5 \equiv 6 \mod 8$.

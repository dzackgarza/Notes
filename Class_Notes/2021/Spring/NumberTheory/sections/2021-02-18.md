Last time: we defined an equivalence relation on nonzero ideals of $\ZZ_K$, namely \( I \approx J \iff I = \alpha J \) for some \( \alpha \in K\units \).
We then defined the **class group**
\[
\Cl(\ZZ_K) \da \Id(\ZZ_K) / \approx
.\]
We saw that ideal multiplication descends to a well-defined group structure on ideal classes. 
Since ideal multiplication is commutative, this is an abelian group, and moreover it is finite.

:::{.example title="Computing the Class Group"}
Let $K = \QQ(d)$ where \( d \da \sqrt{ -5 } \).
We saw that every ideal class is represented by an element with bounded norm.
Applying it to this specific value of $d$, every element is represented by $[I]$ where \( N(I) \leq 6 \).
If we have such an ideal, it will factor into primes, and thus the class will factor into prime classes. 
Thus the group is actually *generated* by prime ideals of norm at most 6.
Any such ideal will lie above a prime $p \leq 6$, so $p=2,3,5$.
We saw
\[
\gens{ 2 } = P_1^2 && P_1 \da \gens{ 2, 1 + \sqrt{-5} } \\
\gens{ 3 } = P_2 P_3 && P_2 \da \gens{ 3, 1 + \sqrt{-5} },\, P_3 \da \gens{ 3, 1 - \sqrt{-5} }    \\
\gens{ 5 } = P_4^2 && P_4 \da \gens{ \sqrt{-5} }.  
.\]
We conclude that \( \Cl(\ZZ_K) = \gens{ P_1, \cdots, P_4 }  \).
What are the relations?

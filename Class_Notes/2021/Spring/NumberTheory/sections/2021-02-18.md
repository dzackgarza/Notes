:::{.remark}
Last time: we defined an equivalence relation on nonzero ideals of $\ZZ_K$, namely \( I \approx J \iff I = \alpha J \) for some \( \alpha \in K\units \).
We then defined the **class group**
\[
\Cl(\ZZ_K) \da \Id(\ZZ_K) / \approx
.\]
We saw that ideal multiplication descends to a well-defined group structure on ideal classes. 
Since ideal multiplication is commutative, this is an abelian group, and moreover it is finite.

:::{.example title="Computing the Class Group"}
Let $K = \QQ(d)$ where \( d \da \sqrt{ -5 } \).
We saw that every ideal class is represented by an element with bounded norm.
Applying it to this specific value of $d$, every element is represented by $[I]$ where \( N(I) \leq 6 \).

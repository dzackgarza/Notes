# Lecture 3 (Thursday, January 21)

Today: roughly corresponds to chapter 3 in the book.
Goal: do all of the big theorems in the setting of quadratic number fields, then redo everything for general number fields.

## Quadratic Number Fields

Simplest case: $\QQ$, a degree 1 number field, so the next simplest case is degree 2.


:::{.definition title="Quadratic Number Fields"}
A field $K$ is a **quadratic number field** if and only if $K$ is a number field and $[K: \QQ] = 2$.
:::


:::{.remark}
Some notation: if $d\in \RR\units$, then $\sqrt d$ means the *positive* square root of $d$ if $d \geq 0$, and if $d<0$ this denotes $i\sqrt{\abs{d}}$.
:::


:::{.proposition title="?"}
If $K$ is a quadratic number field, then $K = \QQ(\sqrt{d})$ for some squarefree $d\in \ZZ$.
Moreover, this $d$ is uniquely determined by $K$.

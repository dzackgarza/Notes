# Lecture 3 (Thursday, January 21)

Today: roughly corresponds to chapter 3 in the book.
Goal: do all of the big theorems in the setting of quadratic number fields, then redo everything for general number fields.

## Quadratic Number Fields

Simplest case: $\QQ$, a degree 1 number field, so the next simplest case is degree 2.


:::{.definition title="Quadratic Number Fields"}
A field $K$ is a **quadratic number field** if and only if $K$ is a number field and $[K: \QQ] = 2$.

:::{.remark}
Some notation: if $d\in \RR\units$, then $\sqrt d$ means the *positive* square root of $d$ if $d \geq 0$, and if $d<0$ this denotes $i\sqrt{\abs{d}}$.
:::


:::{.proposition title="?"}
If $K$ is a quadratic number field, then $K = \QQ(\sqrt{d})$ for some squarefree 
[^note_squarefree]
$d\in \ZZ$.
Moreover, this $d$ is uniquely determined by $K$, so all quadratic number fields are parameterized by the set of squarefree integers.

[^note_squarefree]: 
*Squarefree* means not divisible by $n^2$ for any $n > 1\in \ZZ$, or equivalently not divisible by the square of any primes.

:::{.proof title="?"}
Existence: since $[K: \QQ] = 2$, we have $K\supsetneq \QQ$ so pick \( \alpha\in K\sm \QQ \) then $K = \QQ(\alpha)$.
Note that we could also furnish this \( \alpha \) from the primitive element theorem, although this is overkill here.
So \( \alpha \) is a root of some degree 2 $f\in \QQ[x]$, and by scaling coefficients we can replace this by $f\in \ZZ[x]$.
So write $f(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + C$, in which case we can always write \( \alpha = {-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC} \over 2A} \) where $A\neq 0$ since this would imply that \( \alpha\in\QQ \).

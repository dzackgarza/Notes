## Motivation

Solving Diophantine equations, i.e. polynomial equations over $\ZZ$.


:::{.example title="?"}
Consider $y^2 = x^3 + x$.


:::{.claim}
$(x, y) = (0, 0)$ is the only solution.
:::

To see this, write $y^2 = x(x^2+1)$, which are relatively prime, i.e. no $D\in \ZZ$ divides both of them.
Why?
If $d \divides x$ and $d \divides x+1$, then $d\divides (x^2+1) + (-x) = 1$.
It's also the case that both $x^2+1$ and $x^2$ are squares (up to a unit), so $x^2, x^2 + 1$ are consecutive squares in $\ZZ$.
But the gaps between squares are increasing: $1, 2, 4, 9, \cdots$.
The only possibilities would be $x=0, y=1$, but in this case you can conclude $y=0$.

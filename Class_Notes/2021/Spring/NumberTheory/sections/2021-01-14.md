## Motivation

Solving Diophantine equations, i.e. polynomial equations over $\ZZ$.


:::{.example title="?"}
Consider $y^2 = x^3 + x$.


:::{.claim}
$(x, y) = (0, 0)$ is the only solution.
:::

To see this, write $y^2 = x(x^2+1)$, which are relatively prime, i.e. no $D\in \ZZ$ divides both of them.
Why?
If $d \divides x$ and $d \divides x+1$, then $d\divides (x^2+1) + (-x) = 1$.
It's also the case that both $x^2+1$ and $x^2$ are squares (up to a unit), so $x^2, x^2 + 1$ are consecutive squares in $\ZZ$.
But the gaps between squares are increasing: $1, 2, 4, 9, \cdots$.
The only possibilities would be $x=0, y=1$, but in this case you can conclude $y=0$. 

:::


:::{.example title="Fermat"}
Consider $y^2 = x^3-2$.


:::{.claim}
$(3, \pm 5)$ are the only solutions.
:::

Rewrite $x^3 = y^2+2 =(y+ \sqrt{-2})(y - \sqrt{-2})$, factored in $\ZZ[\sqrt{-2}] \da \ts{a+b\srt{-2} \st a,b,\in \ZZ}$.
This is a subring of $\CC$, and thus at least an integral domain.
We want to try the same argument: showing the two factors are relatively prime.


:::{.definition title="Norm Map"}
For \( \alpha\in \ZZ[\sqrt{-2}] \) define $N \alpha = \alpha\bar \alpha$.
:::


:::{.lemma title="?"}
Let \( \alpha, \beta \in \ZZ[\sqrt{-2}] \).
Then 

1. \( N(\alpha \beta) = N(\alpha) N(\beta) \)
2. $N( \alpha) \in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$ and $N(\alpha) = 0$ if and only if \( \alpha= 0 \).

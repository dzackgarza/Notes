# Ch. 12: Lattice Points (Monday, March 01)


:::{.remark}
Basic heuristic from last time: counting the lattice points in a region $R$ should be approximately $\vol(R)$.
We turned this into a theorem for certain regions:
:::


:::{.theorem title="?"}
Let $R \subseteq \RR^n$ be a bounded region with a well-defined with respect to the Riemann integral.
Letting $L_{R}$ be the number of lattice points in $R$, we have
\[
{1\over t^n} L_{tR} \converges{n\to \infty}\to \vol(R)
.\]

:::{.remark}
Most of today: Minkowski's theorem, which will guarantee a lattice point under some conditions.
:::


:::{.theorem title="Minkowski (Version 1)"}
Let $R \subseteq \RR^n$ be a bounded region that is

1. Convex, so any line segment connecting two points in $R$ is entirely contained within $R$, and 

2. Symmetric about $\vector 0$, so $\vector x\in R\implies -\vector x\in R$.

If $\vol(R) > 2^n$, then $R$ contains a nonzero lattice point.

:::{.remark}
Any circle/ball or ellipse will be an example.
Note that $2^n$ is sharp, i.e. this theorem does not hold for a smaller constant: take the square $(-1, 1) \cross (-1, 1) \subseteq \RR^2$, which has volume 4 but only contains the origin as a lattice point.

# Ch. 12: Lattice Points (Monday, March 01)

## Minkowski (Version 1)

:::{.remark}
Basic heuristic from last time: counting the lattice points in a region $R$ should be approximately $\vol(R)$.
We turned this into a theorem for certain regions:
:::

:::{.theorem title="?"}
Let $R \subseteq \RR^n$ be a bounded region with a well-defined with respect to the Riemann integral.
Letting $L_{R}$ be the number of lattice points in $R$, we have
\[
{1\over t^n} L_{tR} \converges{t\to \infty}\to \vol(R)
.\]
:::

:::{.remark}
Most of today: Minkowski's theorem, which will guarantee a lattice point under some conditions.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Minkowski (Version 1)"}
Let $R \subseteq \RR^n$ be a bounded region that is

1. Convex, so any line segment connecting two points in $R$ is entirely contained within $R$, and 

2. Symmetric about $\vector 0$, so $\vector x\in R\implies -\vector x\in R$.

If $\vol(R) > 2^n$, then $R$ contains a nonzero lattice point.
:::

:::{.remark}
Any circle/ball or ellipse will be an example.
Note that $2^n$ is sharp, i.e. this theorem does not hold for a smaller constant: take the square $(-1, 1) \cross (-1, 1) \subseteq \RR^2$, which has volume 4 but only contains the origin as a lattice point.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
Note that any such region already contains $\vector 0$, since containing $\vector x$ and $-\vector x$ plus convexity implies containing the line between them, which passes through $\vector 0$.
By assumption $\vol(R) > 2^n$, and hence $(1/t^n)L_{tR} > 2^n$ for $t$ large enough.
So set $t=m$ for some $m>> 1\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}$, this yields $L_{mR} > (2m)^n$.
Consider $\ZZ^n$ and taking all coordinates $\mod 2m$.
This yields $(2m)^n$ equivalence classes of points, so by the pigeonhole principle there exist $\vector v_1 \neq \vector v_2 \in mR$ such that $(\vector_1 - \vector_2)/2m \in \ZZ^n$, and the claim is that this is the lattice point we want.
Note that this is nonzero, why is it in the region $R$?
By definition, $(1/m)\vector v_1 \in R$ and $(-1/m)\vector v_2 \in R$ using the symmetric assumption.
The midpoint between these is precisely the previous point, and this is in $R$ by convexity.

## Minkowski (Version 2)


:::{.definition title="Lattice"}
A **lattice** in $\RR^n$ is the $\ZZ\dash$span of a collection of $\RR\dash$linearly independent vectors in $\RR^n$.
:::


:::{.example title="$n=2$"}
\envlist

- \( \Lambda \da \ZZ \tv{1, 0}^t + \ZZ\ts{0, 1}^t \).
  This tiles the plane by squares.
- \( \Lambda \da \ZZ \tv{1, 1}^t + \ZZ\ts{1, 3}^t \).
  Note that this now tiles the plane by parallelograms:

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[thin,gray!40] (-1,-1) grid (4,4);
  \draw[<->] (-1,0)--(4,0) node[right]{$x$};
  \draw[<->] (0,-1)--(0,4) node[above]{$y$};
  \draw[line width=1pt,blue,-stealth](0,0)--(1,1) node[anchor=south west]{$\boldsymbol{u}$};
  \draw[line width=1pt,purple,-stealth](1,1)--(2,4) node[anchor=south west]{};
  \draw[line width=1pt,purple,-stealth](0,0)--(1,3) node[anchor=north east]{$\boldsymbol{v}$};
\draw[line width=1pt,blue,-stealth](1,3)--(2,4) node[anchor=south west]{};

\draw [draw=black, fill=purple, opacity=0.4]
       (0,0) -- (1,1) -- (2,4) -- (1,3) -- cycle;
\end{tikzpicture}

- \( \Lambda \da \ZZ \tv{1, 0}^t \), which recovers \( \ZZ \subseteq \RR \).
  This is not a full lattice, since it lies in a proper subspace of $\RR^2$.

Note that this will always result in a free abelian group on $n$ generators.
Why not define a lattice this way?
Here's a non-example:

- \( \Lambda \da \ZZ \tv{\sqrt{2} , 0}^t + \ZZ\ts{1, 0}^t \), which are not linearly independent over $\RR$.
  This yields a dense set of points on the real axis in $\RR^2$, and is still a free abelian group of rank 2.
  We'll see later that no lattice can be dense, and in fact they must always be discrete.

:::


:::{.remark}
It may not be obvious that a lattice has a uniquely determined number of generating elements.
This turns out to be true: if \( \Lambda = \sum_{i=1}^d  \ZZ \vector v_i \) with \( \ts{ \vector{v}_i }_{i=1}^d \) linearly independent over $\RR$, then \( \Lambda\tensor_\ZZ \RR \cong \sum_{i=1}^d \RR \vector v_i \cong \RR^d \), which is now an $\RR\dash$vector vector space of real dimension $d$.
Noting that $\dim_\RR(\Lambda\tensor_\ZZ \RR)$ doesn't depend on the choice of basis, any different choice of generating set for \( \Lambda \) must have the same number of generators.
:::


:::{.definition title="Full Lattices"}
If $d=n$, we'll call \( \Lambda \) a **full lattice**.
:::


:::{.definition title="Fundamental Parallelepiped"}
Note that if \( \Lambda \) is full, then \( \Lambda= \sum_{i=1}^n \ZZ \vector{v}_i \) with the $\vector v_i$ linearly independent over $\RR$.
We define the **fundamental parallelepiped** as the set
\[
\ts{ \sum_{i=1}^n c_n \vector v_n \st 0 \leq c_i \leq 1} 
.\]
Note that this depends on the choice of generating set.
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
For $\vector v_1 = \tv{1, 1}^t$ and $\vector v_2 = \tv{1, 3}$, we get the parallelogram shown in the earlier figure.
Note that \( \Lambda \) is also generated by \( \vector v_1 = \tx{1, 1}, \vector w_2 = \tv{0, 2} \), and this generates a different parallelepiped:

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[thin,gray!40] (-1,-1) grid (4,4);
  \draw[<->] (-1,0)--(4,0) node[right]{$x$};
  \draw[<->] (0,-1)--(0,4) node[above]{$y$};
  \draw[line width=1pt,blue,-stealth](0,0)--(1,1) node[anchor=south west]{$\vector v_1$};
  \draw[line width=1pt,purple,-stealth](1,1)--(2,4) node[anchor=south west]{};
  \draw[line width=1pt,purple,-stealth](0,0)--(1,3) node[anchor=south east]{$\vector v_2$};
\draw[line width=1pt,blue,-stealth](1,3)--(2,4) node[anchor=south west]{};

\draw[line width=1pt,green,-stealth](0,0)--(0,2) node[anchor=south east]{$\vector w_2$};

\draw [draw=black, fill=purple, opacity=0.4]
       (0,0) -- (1,1) -- (2,4) -- (1,3) -- cycle;

\draw [draw=black, fill=green, opacity=0.2]
       (0,0) -- (1,1) -- (1,3) -- (0,2) -- cycle;
\end{tikzpicture}

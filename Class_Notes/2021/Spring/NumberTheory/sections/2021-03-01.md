# Ch. 12: Lattice Points (Monday, March 01)

## Minkowski (Version 1)

:::{.remark}
Basic heuristic from last time: counting the lattice points in a region $R$ should be approximately $\vol(R)$.
We turned this into a theorem for certain regions:
:::

:::{.theorem title="?"}
Let $R \subseteq \RR^n$ be a bounded region with a well-defined with respect to the Riemann integral.
Letting $L_{R}$ be the number of lattice points in $R$, we have
\[
{1\over t^n} L_{tR} \converges{t\to \infty}\to \vol(R)
.\]

:::{.remark}
Most of today: Minkowski's theorem, which will guarantee a lattice point under some conditions.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Minkowski (Version 1)"}
Let $R \subseteq \RR^n$ be a bounded region that is

1. Convex, so any line segment connecting two points in $R$ is entirely contained within $R$, and 

2. Symmetric about $\vector 0$, so $\vector x\in R\implies -\vector x\in R$.

If $\vol(R) > 2^n$, then $R$ contains a nonzero lattice point.
:::

:::{.remark}
Any circle/ball or ellipse will be an example.
Note that $2^n$ is sharp, i.e. this theorem does not hold for a smaller constant: take the square $(-1, 1) \cross (-1, 1) \subseteq \RR^2$, which has volume 4 but only contains the origin as a lattice point.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
Note that any such region already contains $\vector 0$, since containing $\vector x$ and $-\vector x$ plus convexity implies containing the line between them, which passes through $\vector 0$.
By assumption $\vol(R) > 2^n$, and hence $(1/t^n)L_{tR} > 2^n$ for $t$ large enough.
So set $t=m$ for some $m>> 1\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}$, this yields $L_{mR} > (2m)^n$.
Consider $\ZZ^n$ and taking all coordinates $\mod 2m$.
This yields $(2m)^n$ equivalence classes of points, so by the pigeonhole principle there exist $\vector v_1 \neq \vector v_2 \in mR$ such that $(\vector_1 - \vector_2)/2m \in \ZZ^n$, and the claim is that this is the lattice point we want.
Note that this is nonzero, why is it in the region $R$?
By definition, $(1/m)\vector v_1 \in R$ and $(-1/m)\vector v_2 \in R$ using the symmetric assumption.
The midpoint between these is precisely the previous point, and this is in $R$ by convexity.

:::{.definition title="Lattice"}
A **lattice** in $\RR^n$ is the $\ZZ\dash$span of a collection of $\RR\dash$linearly independent vectors in $\RR^n$.

:::{.example title="$n=2$"}
\envlist

- \( \Lambda \da \ZZ \tv{1, 0}^t + \ZZ\ts{0, 1}^t \).
- \( \Lambda \da \ZZ \tv{1, 1}^t + \ZZ\ts{1, 3}^t \).

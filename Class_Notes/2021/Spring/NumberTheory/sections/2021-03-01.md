# Ch. 12: Lattice Points (Monday, March 01)


:::{.remark}
Basic heuristic from last time: counting the lattice points in a region $R$ should be approximately $\vol(R)$.
We turned this into a theorem for certain regions:
:::


:::{.theorem title="?"}
Let $R \subseteq \RR^n$ be a bounded region with a well-defined with respect to the Riemann integral.
Letting $L_{R}$ be the number of lattice points in $R$, we have
\[
{1\over t^n} L_{tR} \converges{n\to \infty}\to \vol(R)
.\]

Most of today: Minkowski's theorem.

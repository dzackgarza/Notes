# Big Points

- Homotopy as a means of classification somewhere between homeomorphism and cobordism
- Comparison to homology
- Higher homotopy groups of spheres exist
- Homotopy groups of spheres govern gluing of CW complexes
- CW complexes fully capture that homotopy category of spaces
- Relation to framed cobordism?
- "Measuring stick" for current tools, similar to special values of L-functions

# History

- 1860s-1890s: Defined by Jordan for complex integration
- 

# Actual Outline

- Definitions of spheres and balls
- Definition of homotopy of maps
  - Motivations from complex analysis

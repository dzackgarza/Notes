# Big Points

- Homotopy as a means of classification somewhere between homeomorphism and cobordism
- Comparison to homology
- Higher homotopy groups of spheres exist
- Homotopy groups of spheres govern gluing of CW complexes
- CW complexes fully capture that homotopy category of spaces
- There are concrete topological constructions of many important algebraic operations at the level of spaces (quotients, tensor products)
- Relation to framed cobordism?
- "Measuring stick" for current tools, similar to special values of L-functions
- Serre's computation

# History

- 1860s-1890s: (Roughly) defined by Jordan for complex integration, "combinatorial topology"
- 1895: Poincare, *Analysis situs* ("the analysis of position") in analogy to Euler *Geometria situs* in 1865 on the Kongisberg bridge problem
    Attempts to study spaces arising from gluing polygons, polyhedra, etc (surfaces!), first use of "algebraic invariant theory" for spaces by introducing $\pi_1$ and homology.
- 1920s: Rigorous proof of classification of surfaces (Klein, MÃ¶bius, Clifford, Dehn, Heegard), captured entirely by $\pi_1$ (equivalently, by genus and orientability).
- 1925-1928: Noether, Mayer, Vietoris develop general algebraic theory of homology, now "algebraic topology"
- 1932/1935: Cech (resp Hurewicz) introduce higher homotopy groups, gives a map relating homotopy to homology
- 1937: Freudenthal suspension theorem, investigation into "stable" phenomena.
- 1949: Whitehead introduces CW complexes, importance of homotopy classes of maps between spheres becomes apparent
- 1953: Whitehead shows the homotopy groups of spheres split into stable and unstable ranges. 
  - Serre uses spectral sequences to show finiteness of *all* groups $\pi_k S^n$ are finite except $k=n$, and $k\equiv 3\mod 4, n\equiv 0 \mod 2$.

# Big Points

- Homotopy as a means of classification somewhere between homeomorphism and cobordism
- Higher homotopy groups of spheres exist
- Homotopy groups of spheres govern gluing of CW complexes
- CW complexes fully capture that homotopy category of spaces
- Relation to framed cobordism?

# Actual Outline

- Definitions of spheres and balls

# Big Points

- Homotopy as a means of classification somewhere between homeomorphism and cobordism
- Comparison to homology
- Higher homotopy groups of spheres exist
- Homotopy groups of spheres govern gluing of CW complexes
- CW complexes fully capture that homotopy category of spaces
- There are concrete topological constructions of many important algebraic operations at the level of spaces (quotients, tensor products)
- Relation to framed cobordism?
- "Measuring stick" for current tools, similar to special values of L-functions
- Serre's computation

# History


- 1860s-1890s: (Roughly) defined by Jordan for complex integration, "combinatorial topology"
  - Original motivation: when does a path integral depend on a specific path? (E.g. a contour integral in $\CC$)
- 1895: Poincare, *Analysis situs* ("the analysis of position") in analogy to Euler *Geometria situs* in 1865 on the Kongisberg bridge problem
    Attempts to study spaces arising from gluing polygons, polyhedra, etc (surfaces!), first use of "algebraic invariant theory" for spaces by introducing $\pi_1$ and homology.
- 1920s: Rigorous proof of classification of surfaces (Klein, MÃ¶bius, Clifford, Dehn, Heegard), captured entirely by $\pi_1$ (equivalently, by genus and orientability).
- 1925-1928: Noether, Mayer, Vietoris develop general algebraic theory of homology, now "algebraic topology"
- 1931: Hopf discovers a nontrivial (not homotopic to identity) map $S^3 \to S^2$
  - Compare to homology: $H^k S^n = 0$ for $k\geq n$ is an easy theorem!
- 1932/1935: Cech (resp Hurewicz) introduce higher homotopy groups, gives a map relating homotopy to homology, shows they are abelian groups for $n\geq 2$.
  - Withdrew his paper because of this theorem!
- 1937: Freudenthal suspension theorem, investigation into "stable" phenomena.
- 1938: Pontrayagin shows link between homotopy groups of spheres and framed cobordism classes of submanifolds of $S^n$.
  - Direction of computation: using cobordism classes (geometric) to compute $\pi_k S^n$. Modern day: run the computation backwards to compute cobordism groups.
- 1940: Eilenberg, obstruction theory
- 1949: Whitehead introduces homotopy types, CW complexes, equivalences = weak equivalences. Importance of homotopy classes of maps between spheres becomes apparent
- 1951: Serre uses spectral sequences to show that *all* groups $\pi_k S^n$ are torsion except $k=n$, and $k\equiv 3\mod 4, n\equiv 0 \mod 2$.
  - In first case, $\ZZ$, in second case, $\ZZ \oplus T$ for some torsion group.
  - Tight bounds on where $p\dash$torsion can occur.
- 1953: Whitehead shows the homotopy groups of spheres split into stable and unstable ranges. 
- Today: We know $\pi_{n+k}S^n$ for 
  - $k \leq 64$ when $n\geq k+2$ (stable range)
  - $k \leq 19$ when $n < k+2$ (unstable range) 
  - We *only* have a complete list for $S^0$ and $S^1$, and know *no* patterns beyond this!

[Hopf Fibration Visualizer](http://philogb.github.io/page/hopf/#)
A bundle
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
S_1 \ar[r] & S^3\ar[d] \\
& S^1
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Visualization: the same way $S^2\setminus\pt \to \RR^2$ via stereographic projection, we take $S^3\setminus\pt \to \RR^3$.
Realizes $S^3$ as a family of circles parameterized by a 2-sphere, fiber above each point is a circle.


Application: $\pi_1(\SO(n, \RR)$, the lie group of rigid rotations in 3-space.
The fibration $\SO(n, \RR) \to \SO(n+1, \RR) \to S^n$ yields a LES in homotopy:
\begin{align*}
\pi_2(\SO(n, \RR)) \ar[r]
\pi_2(\SO(n, \RR)) \ar[r]
\pi_2(S^n) \ar[ddl] \\
\pi_1(\SO(n, \RR)) \ar[r]
\pi_1(\SO(n, \RR)) \ar[r]
\pi_1(S^n) \ar[ddl] \\
\end{align*}
which reduces to 
\begin{align*}
\pi_2(\SO(n, \RR)) \ar[r]
\pi_2(\SO(n+1, \RR)) \ar[r]
0 \ar[ddl] \\
\pi_1(\SO(n, \RR)) \ar[r]
\pi_1(\SO(n+1, \RR)) \ar[r]
0 \ar[ddl] \\
\end{align*}

and thus $\pi_1(\SO(3, \RR)) \cong \pi_1(\SO(4, \RR)) \cong \cdots$ and it suffices to compute $\pi_1(\SO(3, \RR))$.
Use the fact that "accidental" homeomorphism in low dimension $\SO(3, \RR) \cong_{\text{Top}} \RP^3$, and standard algebraic topology yields $\pi_1 \RP^3 \cong \ZZ/2\ZZ$.
Important consequence: $\SO(3, \RR)$ is not simply connected! See "plate trick", there is a loop of rotations that is not contractible, but squares to the identity.
Causes problems in robotics (leads to paths in configuration spaces that encounter singularities) and compute graphics (smoothly interpolating between e.g. rotated camera views).

# Review 8.2

# Section 8.3: The Space of Perturbations of H

## Goal

**Goal**: Given a fixed Hamiltonian $H\in C^\infty(W\cross S^1; \RR)$, perturb it (without modifying the periodic orbits) so that $\mcm(x, y)$ are manifolds of the expected dimension.

## Goal

Start by trying to construct a subspace $\mcc_\eps^{\infty}(H) \subset \mcc^\infty(W\cross S^1; \RR)$, the space of perturbations of $H$ depending on a certain sequence $\eps = \theset{\eps_k}$, and show it is a dense subspace.

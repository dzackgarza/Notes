# Review 8.2

# Section 8.3: The Space of Perturbations of H

## Goal

**Goal**: 

Given a fixed Hamiltonian $H\in C^\infty(W\cross S^1; \RR)$, perturb it (without modifying the periodic orbits) so that $\mcm(x, y)$ are manifolds of the expected dimension.

# Section 8.4: Linearizing the Floer Equation: The Differential of F

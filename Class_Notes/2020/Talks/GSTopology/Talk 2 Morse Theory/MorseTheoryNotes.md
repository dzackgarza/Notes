- Definition: critical values and critical points
- Definition: indices of critical points
- Statement: Poincare Conjecture and h-cobordism theorem
- Definition: Morse function and index
  - Look at coordinate-free def?
  - Standard form at critical points
  - $f\inv\bd Y) = \bd X$
- Definition: Stable and generic
- Definition: cobordism
  - Example: (pair of pants)
  - Category: Objects are manifolds, morphisms are cobordisms between them
- Theorem: Every compact manifold has a Morse function.
- Theorem: Morse functions are generic (given any smooth function $f: X\to Y$, there's an arbitrarily small perturbation of $f$ that is Morse).
- Theorem (Morse Lemma): If $p\in \RR^n$ is a critical point of $f: \RR^n \to \RR$ such that the Hessian $H_f(p)$ is a non-degenerate bilinear form, then $f$ is locally Morse (standard form).
  - Moreover, after diagonalizing $H_f$, the index is given by the difference in the numbers of positive/negatives on the diagonal.
- Theorem: If $(W; M_0, M_1) \to [0, 1]$ is Morse with no critical points then $W$ is the trivial cobordism.
  - Consequence: $M_0 \cong_{\text{Diff}} M_1$ is a diffeomorphism, useful to show two things are diffeomorphic, used in higher-dimensional Poincare.

- Definition: critical values and critical points
- Definition: indices of critical points
- Statement: Poincare Conjecture and h-cobordism theorem
- Definition: Morse function and index
  - Look at coordinate-free def?
  - Standard form at critical points
  - $f\inv\bd Y) = \bd X$
- Definition: Stable and generic
- Definition: cobordism
  - Example: (pair of pants)
- Theorem: Every compact manifold has a Morse function.

Goal #1:
Understand foliations and their relation to contact structures.

Definition:
A *hyperplane* field $\xi$ is a sub-bundle of the tangent bundle $\RR^n \to TM \to M$.

Example:
Let $M = \RR^3$ so $TM \cong \RR^3$. 
Write $TM = \RR dx_1 \oplus \RR dx_2 \oplus \RR dx_3$ and define $\xi$ by the condition $dx_3 = 0$.

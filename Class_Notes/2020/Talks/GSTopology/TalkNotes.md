Convention: 
All manifolds discussed will be smooth, real, Hausdorff, second-countable, not necessarily closed/compact.

Goal #1:
Understand foliations and their relation to contact structures.

Definition:
A *hyperplane* field $\xi$ is a codimension 1 sub-bundle $\RR^{n-1} \to \xi \to M$ of the tangent bundle $\RR^n \to TM \to M$

Example:
Let $M = \RR^3$ so $TM \cong \RR^3$. 
Write $TM = \RR dx_1 \oplus \RR dx_2 \oplus \RR dx_3$ and define $\xi$ by the condition $dx_3 = 0$.

This is a defining example

Convention: 
All manifolds discussed will be smooth, real, Hausdorff, second-countable, connected, not necessarily closed/compact, possibly with boundary.

Goal #1:
Understand foliations and their relation to contact structures.

Recall the geometric definition of the tangent bundle $TM = \disjoint_{p\in M} T_pM$. 
Note that $T_p M

Definition:
A *hyperplane* field $\xi$ is a codimension 1 sub-bundle $\RR^{n-1} \to \xi \to M$ of the tangent bundle $\RR^n \to TM \to M$

Example:
Let $M = \RR^3$ so $TM \cong \RR^3$. 
Write $TM = \spanof_\RR\theset{\partial x_1, \partial x_2, \partial x_3}$ and $T\dual M = \spanof_\RR\theset{dx_1, dx_2, dx_3}$ and define $\xi$ by the condition $dx_3 = 0$.

This is a defining example

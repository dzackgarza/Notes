# Motivation

Basic question: when does the flow of a vector field admit a *periodic orbit*?

Definition: Hamiltonian flow.

Definition: Reeb flow.

Definition: Reeb vector field.

Definition: Hypersurface of contact type

Example:
The level sets of a Hamiltonian $H  = 

> Remark: all hypersurfaces of contact type $(X, \omega)$ look locally like $X \injects \mathrm{Sp}(X)$, i.e. $X$ embedded into its symplectification.

Remark:
The orbit of a Hamiltonian flow is contained in a single level set.

## Big Theorems

**Theorem (1987):**
Every contact-type hypersurface in the symplectic manifold $(\RR^{2n}, \omega)$ contains a periodic orbit.

**Conjecture (Weinstein, 1978):**
Let $(M, \xi)$ be a closed (compact) contact manifold with a Reeb vector field $X$ and $H^1(M; \RR) = 0$. Then $X$ admits a periodic orbit.

**Theorem (Weinstein, Dimension 3, Overtwisted. 1993):**
Let $(M, \lambda, \xi)$ be a closed contact 3-manifold where $\lambda$ is overtwisted. 
Then the Reeb vector field $X$ admits a periodic orbit.

**Definition:**
$(M, \xi)$ is *overtwisted* iff there exists an embedded disc $D^n \mapsvia{i} M$ such that $T(\bd D^n)_p \subset \xi_p$ pointwise for all $p \in \bd D^n$ and $TD^n_p$ is transverse to $\xi$ for every $p\in  (D^n)^\circ$.

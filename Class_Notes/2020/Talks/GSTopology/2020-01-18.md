# Notes on Mike's Notes

Motivation: building contact and/or symplectic structures on an arbitrary manifold.
Every compact 3-manifold arises as surgery on a link and admits a contact structure. 
However, not every compact 3-manifold admits a fillable contact structure -- need framing to be realizable as a Legendrian framing.
Theorem: every compact contact 3-manifold arises as a combination of (2 different variants of) Weinstein surgeries on $S^3$.

> Variants: "Contact -1 surgery" is where Liouville vector field points outward, and +1 is where it points inward.




Weinstein surgery takes 

- $(W, \lambda)$ a $2n\dash$dimensional manifold
- That is exact and symplectic
- With contact-type boundary $\bd W$
- Where the Liouville vector field points outward along $\bd W$

and produces a distinct manifold $(W(\Lambda), \lambda')$ with the above properties which is obtained by surgery along $\Lambda$ an isotropic embedded sphere

> $\Lambda$ is isotropic iff it's an embedded $S^{k-1}$ such that $\restrictionof{\lambda}{\Lambda} = 0$.

Thus $W(\Lambda)$ is obtained from attaching a $k\dash$handle to $W$ along $\Lambda$. 


Definition:
$W$ is a symplectic manifold iff $W$ is smooth of even dimension and admits a closed, nondegenerate, skew-symmetric bilinear 2-form.


> Motivation: There is Hamiltonian $H$ in the background inducing a vector field and thus a flow associated to $\dd{H}{t}$.
I.e., it is a map

\begin{align*}
\omega: TM \tensor TM \to \RR \in \Omega^2(W) = \Gamma^{\infty}(\wedge^2 T\dual W)
\end{align*}

that is

- Bilinear
  - Really a map $f: TM \to T\dual M$ (why?) which we identify with $f\in T\dual M \tensor T\dual M$.
- Skew-symmetric, so $\omega(v, w) = -\omega(w, v)$.
  - $H$ should be constant along flow lines, i.e. $dH(V_H) = \omega(V_H, V_H) = 0$
- Closed, so $d\omega = 0$
  - The lie derivative of $\omega$ along $V_H$ is 0, i.e. $\mathcal{L}_{V_H}(\omega) = 0$. 
- Non-degenerate, so at every point $p\in W$, $\omega_p \in (T_p\dual M)^{\tensor 2}$ is a nondegenerate form on a vector space, i.e. $\omega_p(v, w) = 0$ for all $y$ implies $x=0$.
  - For every $dH$ there exists a vector field $V_H$ such that $dH = \omega(V_H, \wait)$.

Remark:
Symplectic manifolds admit almost complex structures.

Definition:
$W$ is an *exact* symplectic manifold iff there exists a 1-form $\alpha \in \Omega^1(W)$ such that $d\alpha = \omega$, i.e. $\omega$ is an exact form.

# Notes on Mike's Notes

Motivation: building contact and/or symplectic structures on an arbitrary manifold.
Weinstein surgery takes 

- $(W, \lambda)$ a $2n\dash$dimensional manifold
- That is exact and symplectic
- With contact-type boundary $\bd W$
- Where the Liouville vector field points outward along $\bd W$

and produces a distinct manifold $(W(\Lambda), \lambda')$ with the above properties which is obtained by surgery along $\Lambda$ an isotropic embedded sphere

> $\Lambda$ is isotropic iff it's an embedded $S^{k-1}$ such that $\restrictionof{\lambda}{\Lambda} = 0$.

Thus

# Notes on Mike's Notes

Motivation: building contact and/or symplectic structures on an arbitrary manifold.
Every compact 3-manifold arises as surgery on a link and admits a contact structure. 
However, not every compact 3-manifold admits a fillable contact structure -- need framing to be realizable as a Legendrian framing.
Theorem: every compact contact 3-manifold arises as a combination of (2 different variants of) Weinstein surgeries on $S^3$.

> Variants: "Contact -1 surgery" is where Liouville vector field points outward, and +1 is where it points inward.




Weinstein surgery takes 

- $(W, \lambda)$ a $2n\dash$dimensional manifold
- That is exact and symplectic
- With contact-type boundary $\bd W$
- Where the Liouville vector field points outward along $\bd W$

and produces a distinct manifold $(W(\Lambda), \lambda')$ with the above properties which is obtained by surgery along $\Lambda$ an isotropic embedded sphere

> $\Lambda$ is isotropic iff it's an embedded $S^{k-1}$ such that $\restrictionof{\lambda}{\Lambda} = 0$.

Thus $W(\Lambda)$ is obtained from attaching a $k\dash$handle to $W$ along $\Lambda$. 


Definition:
$W$ is a symplectic manifold iff $W$ is smooth of even dimension and admits a closed, nondegenerate, skew-symmetric bilinear 2-form.

I.e., it is a map

\begin{align*}
\omega: TM \tensor TM \to \RR \in \Omega^2(W) = \Gamma^{\infty}(\wedge^2 T\dual W)
\end{align*}

that is
 
- Skew-symmetric, so $\omega(v, w) = -\omega(w, v)$.
- 

Definition:
$W$ is an exact symplectic manifold iff

# Motivation

**Theorem:** 
Every compact contact 3-manifold arises as a combination of (2 different variants of) Weinstein surgeries on $S^3$.

> Compare to theorem: every compact 3-manifold arises as surgery on a link.

**Theorem:** 
Weinstein surgery on a *loose Legendrian* knot yields an overtwisted contact structure.

> Compare: Every compact manifold is surgery on a link and admits a contact structure.

> However, not every compact 3-manifold admits a *fillable* contact structure -- need framing to be realizable as a *Legendrian* framing.

**Theorem:** 
Weinstein surgery along a loose Legendrian sphere yields an overtwisted contact manifold.

> Variants: "Contact -1 surgery" is where Liouville vector field points outward, and +1 is where it points inward.


# Definitions

**Preliminary Definition:**
Weinstein surgery takes 

- $(W, \lambda)$ a $2n\dash$dimensional manifold
- That is exact and symplectic
- With contact-type boundary $\bd W$
- Where the Liouville vector field points outward along $\bd W$

and produces a distinct manifold $(W(\Lambda), \lambda')$ with the above properties which is obtained by surgery along $\Lambda$ an *isotropic* embedded sphere

> $\Lambda$ is isotropic iff it's an embedded $S^{k-1}$ such that $\restrictionof{\lambda}{\Lambda} = 0$.

Thus $W(\Lambda)$ is obtained from attaching a $k\dash$handle to $W$ along $\Lambda$. 

**Definition / Convention**:
A smooth function $H: M \to \RR$ will be referred to as an energy functional or a *Hamiltonian*.
If we have $H: M\cross I \to \RR$, we'll refer to this as a *time-dependent Hamiltonian*, i.e. the time slices $H_t: M \to \RR$ given by $H_t(p) = H(p, t)$ are Hamiltonians.

**Definition:**
Recall that for any smooth function $H: M\to N$, the *derivative* of $H$ at $p\in M$ is defined by $dH_p: T_pM \to T_p N$ which we define using the derivation definition of tangent vectors: given a derivation $v\in T_p M: C^\infty(M) \to \RR$, we send it to the derivation $w_v \in T_{q}M = C^\infty(M) \to \RR$ where $w_v$ actson on $f\in C^\infty(M)$ by precomposition, i.e. $w_v \actson f = v(f \circ H)$.

**Definition:**
The interior product $\iota$ is given by 

*Remark:*
If $(M, \omega)$ is a symplectic manifold, each $H_t: M \to I$ induces a unique vector field $X_{H_t}$ characterized by the property $\iota_{X_{H_t}}\omega = -dH_t$.

**Definition:**
Recall that $W$ is a **symplectic manifold** iff $W$ is smooth of even dimension and admits a closed, nondegenerate, skew-symmetric bilinear 2-form.


> Motivation: There is Hamiltonian $H$ in the background inducing a vector field and thus a flow associated to $\dd{H}{t}$.
I.e., it is a map

\begin{align*}
\omega: TM \tensor TM \to \RR \\
\omega \in \Omega^2(W) = \Gamma^{\infty}(\wedge^2 T\dual W)
\end{align*}

that is

- Closed, so $d\omega = 0$
  - The lie derivative of $\omega$ along $V_H$ is 0, i.e. $\mathcal{L}_{V_H}(\omega) = 0$. 
  > Note:

- Non-degenerate, so at every point $p\in W$, $\omega_p \in (T_p\dual M)^{\tensor 2}$ is a nondegenerate form on a vector space, i.e. $\omega_p(v, w) = 0$ for all $y$ implies $x=0$.
  - Implies that for every $dH$ there exists a vector field $V_H$ such that $dH = \omega(V_H, \wait)$.

- Skew-symmetric, so $\omega(v, w) = -\omega(w, v)$.
  - $H$ should be constant along flow lines, i.e. $dH(V_H) = \omega(V_H, V_H) = 0$

- Bilinear
  - Really a map $f: TM \to T\dual M$ (why?) which we identify with $f\in T\dual M \tensor T\dual M$.


Remark:
These occurs as *phases spaces* in classical mechanics.

Remark:
Symplectic manifolds admit almost complex structures.

Remark:
A symplectic structure gives a way of measuring signed areas of 2-dimensional oriented submanifolds, and flows that are area-preserving.

Definition:
$W$ is an *exact* symplectic manifold iff there exists a 1-form $\lambda \in \Omega^1(W)$ such that $d\lambda \in \Omega^2(W)$ is non-degenerate.

Remark:
If $(W, \lambda)$ is exact symplectic then $(W, d\lambda)$ is symplectic.

Remark:
If $(W, \lambda)$ is exact and $H: \RR \cross M \to \RR$ is smooth, then the *Hamiltonian flow* $\phi_H^t: M \to M$ is defined for all time and is an *exact symplectomorphism*.

> Note: exact symplectomorphisms are diffeomorphisms $\psi$ where there exists an $f:M\to \RR$ such that $\psi^*\lambda' - \lambda = df$.

Definition:
Let $(W, \lambda)$ be exact symplectic, so $(W, \omega)$ is symplectic for $\omega = d\lambda$.
The Liouville vector field on $(W, \omega)$ is the (unique) vector field $X \in \Gamma^\infty(TM)$ such that $\iota_x d\lambda = \lambda$.

Remark:
If $X$ induces a flow $\psi^{X, t}$, we have

\begin{align*}
\psi^{X, t *} d \lambda=e^{t} d \lambda \implies \\
\operatorname{Area}_{d \lambda}\left(\psi^{X, t}(S)\right):=\int_{\psi^{X, i}(S)} d \lambda=\int_{S} \psi^{X, t *} d \lambda=e^{t} \operatorname{Area}_{d \lambda}(S)
\end{align*}

for $S$ any compact 2-dimensional submanifold.
This says that the flow lines of $X$ "dilate" the areas of surfaces at an exponential rate, or that $X$ is an "infinitesimal generator" of a dilation, i.e. a scaling of $\omega$.

Example:
On $\RR^{2n}$, take 

\begin{align*}
\lambda=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{j}\left(p_{j} d q_{j}-q_{j} d p_{j}\right)
\implies 
d \lambda=\sum_{j} d p_{j} \wedge d q_{j} 
\implies 
X=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{j}\left(p_{j} \partial_{p_{j}}+q_{j} \partial_{q_{j}}\right)
.\end{align*}

This is vector field pointing radially out of the origin with magnitude at $\vector v$ equal to $\frac 1 2 \norm{\vector v}$, and induces a flow

\begin{align*}
\psi^{X, t}(\vec{p}, \vec{q})=\left(e^{t / 2} \vec{p}, e^{t / 2} \vec{q}\right)
.\end{align*}

> Note: unless otherwise stated, $X$ will denote a Liouville vector field.

Remark:
This is useful because even if $W$ isn't compact, we can obtain $W$ as the "limit" of compact submanifolds where we inflate along this flow.

Definition:
For $(W, \lambda)$ an exact symplectic manifold, a codimension 1 submanifold $Y \subset W$ is of *restricted contact-type* iff $X$ is transverse to $Y$, i.e. for every $p\in Y$, we have $X(p) \not\in T_p(Y)$.
We say $Y$ is of *contact type* iff there is a neighborhood $U \supset Y$ and a one-form $\lambda$ with $d\lambda = \restrictionof{\omega}{U}$ making $(U, \lambda)$ of restricted contact type.

Remark:
$(U, \lambda)$ is of restricted contact type iff $\restrictionof{\lambda}{U}$ is a contact form.

Definition:
$(W, \lambda)$ is a liouville domain iff $W$ is a compact exact symplectic manifold with boundary such that $X$ points outwards on $\bd W$.

Weinstein Surgery:
Let $(W, \lambda)$ be a liouville domain (although we won't need compactness).

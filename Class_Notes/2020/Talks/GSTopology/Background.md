**Definition (Derivative of a Map):**
Recall that for any smooth function $H: M\to N$, the *derivative* of $H$ at $p\in M$ is defined by $dH_p: T_pM \to T_p N$ which we define using the derivation definition of tangent vectors: given a derivation $v\in T_p M: C^\infty(M) \to \RR$, we send it to the derivation $w_v \in T_{q}M = C^\infty(M) \to \RR$ where $w_v$ actson on $f\in C^\infty(M)$ by precomposition, i.e. $w_v \actson f = v(f \circ H)$.

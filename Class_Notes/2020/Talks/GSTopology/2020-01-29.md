Definition:
Exact symplectic manifold $(M, \lambda)$, $\lambda \in \Omega^1(M)$, with $\omega = d\lambda$ for $\omega \in \Omega^2(M)$.

Definition:
Liouville vector field $X$ is the solution of $\mcl_X \omega = \omega$, which yields $i_x d\lambda = \lambda$ where $i_x \omega(y) \definedas \omega(x, y)$.

Let $\psi^{x, t}$ be the flow associated to $X$.

Example:
Standard form on $\RR^{2n}$, yields exponential dilation.
Pick a compact orient surface $S$, find $\mathrm{Area}(\psi(S)) = e^t \mathrm{Area}(S)$.

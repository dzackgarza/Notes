Let $\psi^{x, t}$ be the flow associated to $X$.

Example:
Standard form on $\RR^{2n}$, yields exponential dilation.
Pick a compact orient surface $S$, find $\mathrm{Area}(\psi(S)) = e^t \mathrm{Area}(S)$.

Restricted contact-type hypersurfaces

Weinstein Domain

Theorem:
$d \lambda = 0$ over the core.

title: Han's Talk: Flows on Symplectic Manifolds
---

Let $(M, \omega)$ be a symplectic manifold and $V = \theset{V_t \suchthat t\in \RR}$ a time-dependent vector field.

Then $V$ is symplectic iff $\iota_{V_t} \omega(u) = \omega(V_t, u)$ is closed, Hamiltonian iff exact.

For $H: I \cross M \to \RR$, $\omega$ nondegenerate implies there's a unique $X_{H+t}$ with $\iota_{X_{H_t}} \omega = -dH_t$, yielding the Hamiltonian vector field of $H$ and a corresponding flow.

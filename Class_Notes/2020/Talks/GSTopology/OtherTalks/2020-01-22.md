title: Han's Talk: Flows on Symplectic Manifolds
---

Let $(M, \omega)$ be a symplectic manifold and $V = \theset{V_t \suchthat t\in \RR}$ a time-dependent vector field.

Then $V$ is symplectic iff $\iota_{V_t} \omega(u) = \omega(V_t, u)$ is closed, Hamiltonian iff exact.

> Note: Exact implies closed.

For $H: I \cross M \to \RR$, $\omega$ nondegenerate implies there's a unique $X_{H+t}$ with $\iota_{X_{H_t}} \omega = -dH_t$, yielding the Hamiltonian vector field of $H$ and a corresponding flow.

Example: 
$\RR^{2n}$ with the standard $\omega$, can write flow in $\CC^n$ explicitly.

Example:
$T\dual S^1 \cong \RR \cross S^1$.
Take $\omega = dp \wedge dq$ and the flow $-\dd{}{p}$.

Symplectic: Preserves area


Definition:
Area enclosed by $\gamma$ for $\gamma: S^1 \to \RR^{2n}$ is $A(\gamma) = \int_{D^2} u^* \omega_0$ for any $u^*$ extending $\gamma$.
Doesn't depend on choice, use Stokes theorem.

Proposition:
For $H: \RR^{2n} \to \RR$, if $X_H$ is complete then the flow is area-preserving.

Definitions:
For $S\subset M$, define $T_pS^\omega = \theset{u\in T_pM \suchthat \omega(u?) = 0}$.

- Lagrangian iff $T_p S = T_p S^\omega$
- Isotropic iff $\subset$
- Coisotropic iff $\supset$.

Notation:
$H: M \to \RR$, $\phi_H^t, X_H$.

Proposition:
$H(\phi_H^t(x)) = H(x)$, so $H$ is constant along level sets of $H$.

If $C \subset M$ is coisotropic, and $\restrictionof{H}{C}$ is constant, then $\phi_H^t(C) \subset C$.

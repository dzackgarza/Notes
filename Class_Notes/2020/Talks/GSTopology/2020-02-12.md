Take $M$ compact, and $p\in \crit(f)$ where $f(x_1, \cdots, x_{2n-k}, y_1, \cdots, y_k) = \sum_{j=1}^{2n-k} a_j x_j^2 - \sum_{j=1}^k b_j y_j^2 + f(p)$.
Assume $f$ is bounded from below.
Why is this useful?
Easy to see the time dependency on $\theset{x\in M \suchthat f(x) \leq t}$, and $\crit(f) < \infty$.

Main tool: gradient flow $\phi_t$, given by

\begin{align*}
X(f) \definedas df(x) = \inner{\grad f, X}
.\end{align*}

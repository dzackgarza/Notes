Recall that the Riemann-Zeta function a product expansion


\begin{align*}
\zeta(s) = \sum n^{-s} = \prod_{p\in P} (1-p^{-s})\inv
\end{align*}

where the product is taken over all primes $P$.

Let $X = V(\theset{f_i})$ be the vanishing locus of a family of polynomials in $\FF_q[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ for some prime power $q$.
Then the Hasse-Weil Zeta function is defined as


\begin{align*}
\zeta_X(t) = e^{\sum_{n\geq 1} \frac 1 n N_n t^n}
\end{align*}

We immediately make a change of variables and send $t\to q^{-s}$ to obtain $\zeta_X(s) = \cdots$.

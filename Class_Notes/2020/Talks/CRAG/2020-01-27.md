Recall that the Riemann-Zeta function a product expansion


\begin{align*}
\zeta(s) = \sum n^{-s} = \prod_{p\in P} (1-p^{-s})\inv
\end{align*}

where the product is taken over all primes $P$.

Let $X = V(\theset{f_i})\definedas V(f)$ be the vanishing locus of a family of polynomials in $F = \FF_q[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ for some prime power $q$.

Let $N_m = \abs{\theset{ \vector x \in X(\FF_q) \suchthat f_i(\vector x) = 0 }} = \abs{V(f)} \subset F$, the number of $\FF_q$ points, or equivalently just the size of this variety.

Then the Hasse-Weil Zeta function is defined as


\begin{align*}
\zeta_X(t) = \exp{\displaystyle\sum_{n\geq 1} \frac 1 n N_n t^n}
\end{align*}

We immediately make a change of variables and send $t\to q^{-s}$ to obtain

\begin{align*}
\zeta_X(s) = \exp{\sum_{n\geq 1} \frac 1 n N_n q^{-sn}}
.\end{align*}

# Examples

1: $f(x) = x$ over $\FF_q$.

Define $X_q = V(f)$, then this has exactly $q  points over $\FF_q^{n}$ point for every $n$, so $N_n = 1$ and

\begin{align*}
\zeta_{X_q}(s) = \exp{\sum_{n\geq 1} \frac 1 n  (p^{-sn})} &= e^{-\log(1 - p^{-s})}= (1-p^{-s})\inv
.\end{align*}

Note that the usual $\zeta_s = \prod_{p\text{ prime}} \zeta_{X_p}(s)$, i.e. Riemann Zeta is a product of Hasse-Weil zetas over all primes.

# Notes from Daniel's Office Hours

0. Definition of Zeta functions
0. Statement of the conjectures
2. Easy examples: $\PP^n_{\kk},\Gr_{\kk}(k, n) = \GL(n, \kk) / P$ the stabilizer of an $\kk\dash$point in $\CC^n, \FF_{p^n}$.
3. Medium example: $E/\kk$ an elliptic curve.
4. Work out a harder example as in Weil

## Definition of Zeta Function

Fix $\FF_q$ a finite field, along with its unique degree $n$ extensions $\FF_{q^n}$ for all $n\in \ZZ^{\geq 2}$.

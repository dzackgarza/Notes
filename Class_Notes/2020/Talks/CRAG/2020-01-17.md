General form of a zeta function: $\zeta(x) = \exp\qty{\sum \frac{a_n x^n}{n} }$.

Here we fix a prime $p$ and a system of polynomials $S = \theset{f_i}$, take the variety $V(S)$ and let

- $a_1$ be its number of points of $\FF_p$
- $a_2$ be its number of points of $\FF_{p^2}$
- $\cdots a_n$ be its number of points of $\FF_{p^n}$

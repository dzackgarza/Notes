Here we fix a prime $p$ and a system of polynomials $S = \theset{f_i}$ of degree $n$, take the variety $V(S)$ and let

- $a_1$ be its number of points of $\FF_p$
- $a_2$ be its number of points of $\FF_{p^2}$
- $\cdots a_n$ be its number of points of $\FF_{p^n}$

Idea: assemble them into a generating function.

For unknown reasons, we put them in a zeta function instead: $\zeta(x) = \exp\qty{\sum \frac{a_n x^n}{n} }$.

Conjectures:

1. $\zeta(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ is a rational function.
2. There is an explicit formula $P(x) = \prod_{i\text{ odd}}^{2n-1} P_i(x)$ and $Q(x) = \prod{i\text{ even}}P_i(x)$ with each $P_i \in \ZZ[x]$.
  - For every root $r$ of every $P_i$, $\frac 1 r$ is algebraic
  - (Riemann Hypothesis) Every root has modulus equal to $p^{-i/2}$ (???)
3. (Functional Equation) The function $z \mapsto \frac{1}{p^n z}$ interchanges roots of $P_i$ with roots of $P_{2n-i}$.
4. (Under some conditions) $\deg P_i = \beta_i(V)$, the $i$th Betti number of $i$.


Relation to fixed points: In $\FF_{p^m}$, every point is a fixed point of the Frobenius $\Phi_{p^m}$.
So for any field $F \supset \FF_{p^m}$, the points in $\FF_{p^m}$ are precisely the fixed points of $\Phi_{p^m}: F\to F$ (because enlarging the field can not add more solutions).

Claim:
If $S\subset F^d$ is any subset defined by polynomial equations and $x = (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) \in S$ is a point, then $\Phi_{p^m}(x) = (\Phi_{p^m}(x_1), \cdots) \in S$.
Moreover, the fixed points of $\Phi_{p^m}$ restricted to $S$ are precisely $S \intersect \FF_{p^m}^d$.

Compare 2b above: Riemann says roots are along critical strip $\Re(z) = \frac 1 2$; this says roots of $P_i$ are on a circle of radius $p^{i/2}$ about the origin.
(Note: there is a (conformal?) map that takes the circle to the line, so we can send the roots of $P_i$ to the line $\Re(z) = \frac 1 2$....but not for all $i$ at once.)

Consequences:
Riemann-Zeta: error estimates in the prime number theorem agree with probabilistic models
Weil: error estimates in Ramanujan's $\tau$ is as small as hoped.

Proofs:
Grothendieck: 1,3, and 4 with etale cohomology. Notably not Weil 2.

# Actual Paper

Considers equations of the form $\sum_{i=1}^r a_i x_i^{n_i} = b$.

Examples:

- $ax^3-by^3 = 1$ in $\FF_p$. ($p = 3n+1$, Gauss, when studying "Gaussian sums"/ "cyclotomic periods")
- $ax^4 - by^4$ in $\FF_p$ ($p = 4n+1$, Gauss)

Can consider corresponding variety $V$ over $\CC$, want to relate numbers of solutions to topological properties of $V$.

Fix a finite field $k$ with $q$ elements, $a_i \in k\setminus 0$, $n_i\in \ZZ_{>0}$, and first discuss $b=0$.

Definitions:


\begin{align*}
f: k[x_0, \cdots, x_r] \to k \\
f(x_0, \cdots, x_r) &= a_0 x_0 ^{n_0} + \cdots + a_r x_r^{n_r}
.\end{align*}

> Note: only monomials appearing? 

Example:
Take $k=\ZZ_2$ and $f: k[x, y] \to k$ where $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$.

Let $N \definedas \abs{x\in k \suchthat f(x) =0}$ the number of solutions over $k$
- $d_i \definedas \gcd(n_i, q-1)$ 
- For an arbitrary $u\in k$, $N_i(u) = \abs{\theset{x\in k \suchthat x^{n_i} = u}}$, the number of solutions to $x^{n_i} = u$ in $k$.
  - This is equal to:
    - $1$ if $u = 0$,
    - $d_i$ if $u\neq 0$ is a $d_{i}$th power in $k$
    - $0$ otherwise

Now define

\begin{align*}
L: k^{r+1} &\to k \\
L(u) = L(u_0, \cdots, u_r) &= \sum_{i=0}^r a_i u_i 
.\end{align*}

This yields a decomposition

\begin{align*}
N &= \sum_{u\in k^{r+1} \suchthat L(u) = 0} N_0(u_0) \cdots N_r(u_r)
,\end{align*}

i.e. the total number of solutions of $f$ over $k$

Here we fix a prime $p$ and a system of polynomials $S = \theset{f_i}$ of degree $n$, take the variety $V(S)$ and let

- $a_1$ be its number of points of $\FF_p$
- $a_2$ be its number of points of $\FF_{p^2}$
- $\cdots a_n$ be its number of points of $\FF_{p^n}$

Idea: assemble them into a generating function.

For unknown reasons, we put them in a zeta function instead: $\zeta(x) = \exp\qty{\sum \frac{a_n x^n}{n} }$.

Conjectures:

1. $\zeta(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ is a rational function.
2. There is an explicit formula $P(x) = \prod_{i\text{ odd}}^{2n-1} P_i(x)$ and $Q(x) = \prod{i\text{ even}}P_i(x)$ with each $P_i \in \ZZ[x]$.
  - For every root $r$ of every $P_i$, $\frac 1 r$ is algebraic
  - Every root has modulus equal to $p^{-i/2}$ (???)
3. The function $z \mapsto \frac{1}{p^n z}$ interchanges roots of $P_i$ with roots of $P_{2n-i}$.
4. (Under some conditions) $\deg P_i = \beta_i(V)$, the $i$th Betti number of $i$.


Relation to fixed points: In $\FF_{p^m}$, every point is a fixed point of the Frobenius $\Phi_{p^m}$.
So for any field $F \supset \FF_{p^m}$, the points in $\FF_{p^m}$ are precisely the fixed points of $\Phi_{p^m}: F\to F$ (because enlarging the field can not add more solutions).

# Zeta Functions

## Varieties 

Fix $q$ a prime and $\FF \definedas \FF_q$ the (unique) finite field with $q$ elements, along with its (unique) degree $n$ extensions 
$$
\FF_{q^n} = \theset{x\in \bar \FF_q \suchthat x^{q^n} - x = 0} \quad \forall~ n\in \ZZ^{\geq 2}
$$ 

Definition (Zeta Function)
:  Let $J = \gens{f_1, \cdots, f_M} \normal k[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$
    be an ideal, then a *projective algebraic* variety $X\subset \PP^n_\FF$ can be described as 
    $$
    X = V(J) = \theset{\vector{x} \in \PP^n_\FF \suchthat f_1(\vector x) = \cdots = f_M(\vector x) = \vector 0}
    $$
    where $J$ is generated by *homogeneous* polynomials in $n+1$ variables, i.e. there is a fixed $d = \deg f_i \in \ZZ^{\geq 1}$ such that 

    \begin{align*}
    f(\vector x) = \sum_{\substack{\vector I = (i_1, \cdots, i_n) \\ \sum_j i_j = d}} \alpha_{\vector I} \cdot x_0^{i_1}\cdots x_n^{i_n} 
    \qtext{ and } f(\lambda \cdot \vector x) = \lambda^d f(\vector x), \lambda \in \FF\units
    .\end{align*}


## Point Counts

- For a fixed variety $X$, we can consider its $\FF\dash$points $X(\FF)$.
  - Note that $\# X(\FF) < \infty$ is an integer
- For any $L/\FF$, we can also consider $X(L)$
  - In particular, we can consider $X(\FF_{q^n})$ for any $n\geq 2$.
  - We again have $\# X(\FF_{q^n}) < \infty$ and are integers for every such $n$.
- So we can consider the sequence

\begin{align*}
[N_1, N_2, \cdots , N_n, \cdots ] \definedas [\# X(\FF), ~ \#X (\FF_{q^2}), \cdots, ~\# X(\FF_{q^n}), \cdots]
.\end{align*}

- Idea: associate some generating function (a formal power series) to this sequence, e.g. $$F(z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty N_n z^n = N_1z + N_2 z^2 + \cdots .$$

## Why Generating Functions?

Note that for such an ordinary generating functions, the coefficients are related to the real-analytic properties of $F$: we can easily recover the coefficients in the following way:
\begin{align*}
[z^n] \cdot F(z) = [z^n]\cdot T_{F, z=0}(z) = \frac{1}{n!} \qty{\dd{}{z}}^{n} F(z) \Bigg\rvert_{z = 0} = N_n
.\end{align*}

They are also related to the complex analytic properties: using the Residue theorem, 
\begin{align*}
[z^n] \cdot F(z) \definedas \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\SS^1} {F(z) \over z^{n+1}}~dz = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\SS^1} \frac{N_n}{z} ~dz = N_n
.\end{align*}

> The latter form is very amenable to computer calculation.

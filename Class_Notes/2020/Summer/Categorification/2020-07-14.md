Remarks
:   \hfill
    - The KL basis can be complicated -- you can compute them recursively, but may need to subtract off "constant coefficients" to obtain self-dual elements.
    - There are no closed formulas in general.
    - For any $P\in ! + q \ZZ^{\geq 0}[q]$ there exists an $m\in \ZZ$ such that $v^m P(v^{-2})$ occurs as a KL-polynomial.
    - The KL Positivity Conjecture: $h_{x, w} \in \ZZ^{\geq 0} [v]$, and in fact these non-negative coefficients can be realized as the graded dimension of the local intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties.


Why care?
Set $\lieg = \liesl(n, \CC) = \theset{A\in \CC^{n\times n} \suchthat \tr(A) = 0}$ with $[AB] = AB - BA$.
The case of finite-dimensional representations is well understood, since everything decomposes into simple modules.
In the infinite case, we consider the principal block of category $\OO$: $\OO_0(\lieg)$.
There is a correspondence
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\correspond{Simple modules in $\OO_0$ } & \ar[l] S_n \ar[r] & \correspond{Verma modules in $\OO_0$} \\
L(w) & \ar[l] w \ar[r] & \Delta(w)
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where $L(w)$ are weight modules.

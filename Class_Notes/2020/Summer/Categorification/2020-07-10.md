Definition
:   For $n\geq 1$ and $R$ a commutative ring with $q,z \in R\units$, define the *Iwahoni-Hecke algebra* $H_n^R(q, z)$ is the associative unital $R\dash$algebra 
    \begin{align*}
    \gens{T_i \suchthat T_i T_j = T_j T_i (\abs{i - j} \geq 2) , T_i T_{i+1} T_i = T_{i+1} T_i T_{i+1}, T_i^2 = zT_i q1}
    \end{align*}
    where $1$ is the unit of the algebra.
    The first relation is the "braid relation", the others are the "quadratic" or "skein" relations.

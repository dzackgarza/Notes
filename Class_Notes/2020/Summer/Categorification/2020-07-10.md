Definition
:   For $n\geq 1$ and $R$ a commutative ring with $q,z \in R\units$, define the *Iwahoni-Hecke algebra* $H_n^R(q, z)$ is the associative unital $R\dash$algebra 
    \begin{align*}
    \gens{T_i \suchthat T_i T_j = T_j T_i (\abs{i - j} \geq 2) , T_i T_{i+1} T_i = T_{i+1} T_i T_{i+1}, T_i^2 = zT_i q1}
    \end{align*}
    where $1$ is the unit of the algebra.
    The first relation is the "braid relation", the others are the "quadratic" or "skein" relations.

Theorem (Basis of the Hecke Algebra)
:   \hfill

    1. For all $w \in S_n$, there exists a unique $T_w\in H_n^R(q, z)$ such that whenever $w = \prod s_{i_k}$ is a minimal expression as a product of simply transpositions, then $T_w = \prod T_{i_k}$.
    2. The set $\theset {T_w \suchthat w\in S_n}$ is an $R\dash$module basis of $H_n^R(q, z)$ (the standard basis).


Remarks
:   \hfill

    1. $H_n^R(q, z)$ is a two-parameter generalization of $C(B\\G/B)$, and in fact there is an $R\dash$algebra isomorphism 
    \begin{align*}
    H_n^\CC(q, q-1) &\cong C(B\\G/B)\\
    T_w &\mapsto \delta_w
    .\end{align*}

    2. There is an $R\dash$algebra isomorphism $H_n^R(1, 0) \cong R[S_n]$, so we interpret this as a deformation of the group algebra $R[S_n]$.

    3. There is an $R\dash$algebra isomorphism $H_n^R(q, z) \cong H_n^R(q, z) \cong R[B_n] / \gens{T_i^2 - zT_i - q\cdot 1}$ as a quotient of the group algebra on the braid group.

There is also an $R\dash$algebra morphism
\begin{align*}
\iota_n: H_n^R(q, z) *\to H_{n+1}^R(q, z) \\
T_i &\mapsto T_i
.\end{align*}

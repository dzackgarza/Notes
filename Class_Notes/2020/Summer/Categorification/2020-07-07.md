Recall that we had recursive rules for computing the Kausffman bracket, and a normalization factor for the Jones polynomial that made it into an invariant.
We'd like a closed formula for these.

We do this by ordering the crossings of the unoriented link $1, \cdots, n$, then there is a correspondence
\begin{align*}
\theset{0, 1}^n \iff \text{Complete resolutions} \\
(\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n) \iff \alpha \text{resolves the $i$th crossing}
.\end{align*}

Example:

Claim:
\begin{align*}
\gens{D} = \sum_{\alpha \in \theset{0, 1}^n} (-1)^{\abs \alpha}  v^{\abs \alpha} (v+v\inv)^{c_\alpha(D)}
,\end{align*}

where $\abs \alpha$ is the number of 1-resolutions and $c_\alpha$ is the number of circles in the resolution corresponding to $\alpha$.

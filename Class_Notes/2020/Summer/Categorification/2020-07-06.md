# Motivation

We'll start with $X$ a finite CW complex.

Definition
: A CW complex is a topological space built by inductively attaching $i\dash$dimensional discs ($i\dash$cells) $\DD^i \definedas \theset{\vector x\in \RR^i \suchthat \norm{\vector x} \leq 1}$ along their boundary $\bd \DD^i = S^{i-1} \definedas \theset{\vector x\in \RR^i \suchthat \norm{\vector x} = 1}$.

Define $\chi(X) = \sum_{i\in \ZZ} (-1)^i \abs{C_i}$ where $\abs{C_i}$ is the number of $i\dash$cells.
Note that a homotopy equivalence between spaces induces an equality between Euler characteristics.

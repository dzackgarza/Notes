# Motivation

We'll start with $X$ a finite CW complex.

Definition
: A CW complex is a topological space built by inductively attaching $i\dash$dimensional discs ($i\dash$cells) $\DD^i \definedas \theset{\vector x\in \RR^i \suchthat \norm{\vector x} \leq 1}$ along their boundary $\bd \DD^i = S^{i-1} \definedas \theset{\vector x\in \RR^i \suchthat \norm{\vector x} = 1}$.

Define $\chi(X) = \sum_{i\in \ZZ} (-1)^i \abs{C_i}$ where $\abs{C_i}$ is the number of $i\dash$cells.
Note that a homotopy equivalence between spaces induces an equality between Euler characteristics.

Recall that we can define the cellular chain complex
\begin{align*}
C_*^{\text{cell}}(X, \CC)\definedas \cdots \mapsvia{\del_{i+1}} C_n^{\text{cell}} (X, \CC) \mapsvia{\del_{i}} \cdots \to C_0^{\text{cell}}(X, \CC)
\end{align*}

and $H_i(\XX, \CC) \definedas \ker \del_i / \im \del_{i+1}$.

Exercise
: $\sum (-1)^i \dim H_i(X, \CC) = \chi(X)$.

In this sense, cellular homology categorifies the Euler characteristic: we've replaced a set of objects with a category.
This is an improvement because we may not have maps between the elements of sets, *but* we do have maps between objects in a category.
We can also talk about things such as functoriality.

## Motivation

We'll start with $X$ a finite CW complex.

Definition
: A CW complex is a topological space built by inductively attaching $i\dash$dimensional discs ($i\dash$cells) $\DD^i \definedas \theset{\vector x\in \RR^i \suchthat \norm{\vector x} \leq 1}$ along their boundary $\bd \DD^i = S^{i-1} \definedas \theset{\vector x\in \RR^i \suchthat \norm{\vector x} = 1}$.

Define $\chi(X) = \sum_{i\in \ZZ} (-1)^i \abs{C_i}$ where $\abs{C_i}$ is the number of $i\dash$cells.
Note that a homotopy equivalence between spaces induces an equality between Euler characteristics.

Recall that we can define the cellular chain complex
\begin{align*}
C_*^{\text{cell}}(X, \CC)\definedas \cdots \mapsvia{\del_{i+1}} C_n^{\text{cell}} (X, \CC) \mapsvia{\del_{i}} \cdots \to C_0^{\text{cell}}(X, \CC)
\end{align*}

and $H_i(\XX, \CC) \definedas \ker \del_i / \im \del_{i+1}$.

Exercise
: $\sum (-1)^i \dim H_i(X, \CC) = \chi(X)$.

In this sense, cellular homology categorifies the Euler characteristic: we've replaced a set of objects with a category.
This is an improvement because we may not have maps between the elements of sets, *but* we do have maps between objects in a category.
We can also talk about things such as functoriality.

Example
: Note that $\chi(S^1) = 0$ but also $\chi(S^1 \disjoint S^1) = 0$, so these aren't distinguished, but $H_0(S^1) = \CC$ while $H_0(S^1\disjoint S^1) = \CC\oplus \CC$.

Our first goal will be to assign invariants to oriented links $L$, where homotopy equivalence will be replaced with isotopy.
We'll assign a Khovanov complex $C_*(L,\CC)$, a complex of $\ZZ\dash$graded $\CC\dash$vector spaces, along with the Jones polynomial $J(L) \in \ZZ[t, t\inv]$.
By taking the (graded) Euler characteristic of the chain complex, we'll recover $J(L)$.

## Setup

Definition
: A *link* $L$ is a smooth, closed 1-dimensional embedded submanifold of $\RR^3$. 
$L$ is a *knot* if it consists of one connected component.

We have planar projections:

Under this correspondence, isotopy of knots will correspond to planar isotopy of the diagrams and the following 3 Reidemeister moves:

An example of how to change knot diagrams using these moves:

We now want to take an oriented, planar link diagram $D$ and associate to it a polynomial $J(D)$.

We start by defining the Kauffman bracket: let $D_f$ be $D$ with the orientation forgotten, then $\gens{D_f} \in \ZZ[v, v\inv]$ is defined recursively by

In the last case, the first term is a "0-resolution/0-smoothing" and the second is a "1-resolution/1-smoothing".

We set $J(D) = (-1)^{n_-} v^{n^+ - 2n_-} \gens{D_f}$.

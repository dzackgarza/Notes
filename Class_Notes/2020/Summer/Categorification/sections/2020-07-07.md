Recall that we had recursive rules for computing the Kausffman bracket, and a normalization factor for the Jones polynomial that made it into an invariant.
We'd like a closed formula for these.

We do this by ordering the crossings of the unoriented link $1, \cdots, n$, then there is a correspondence
\begin{align*}
\theset{0, 1}^n \iff \text{Complete resolutions} \\
(\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n) \iff \alpha \text{resolves the $i$th crossing}
.\end{align*}

Example:

Claim:
\begin{align*}
\gens{D} = \sum_{\alpha \in \theset{0, 1}^n} (-1)^{\abs \alpha}  v^{\abs \alpha} (v+v\inv)^{c_\alpha(D)}
,\end{align*}

where $\abs \alpha$ is the number of 1-resolutions and $c_\alpha$ is the number of circles in the resolution corresponding to $\alpha$.



Proof
: Idea: look at resolving the $n$th crossing locally and apply the recursive relation.
Then rewrite the sum by appending $\alpha_n = 0$ and $\alpha_n = 1$ respectively.

Note that we can rewrite the sum as 
\begin{align*}
\sum_{r=0}^n (-1)^r \sum_{\abs \alpha = r} v^r (v+v\inv)^{c_\alpha(D)}
.\end{align*}

This amounts to summing over the "columns" in the previous diagram:

![](figures/image_2020-07-07-11-22-49.png)

Here this yields
\begin{align*}
(v+v\inv)^2 + (-1)2v(v+v\inv) + v^2 (v+v\inv)^2
.\end{align*}

Note that this formula starts to resemble an Euler characteristic!
The problem is that the coefficient $\sum v^r(v+v\inv)^{c_\alpha(D)} \in \ZZ^{\geq 0}[v, v\inv]$ is a Laurent polynomial instead of a natural number, so this can't immediately be interpreted as a dimension of a vector space.

Solution: replace finite-dimensional $\CC\dash$vector spaces by $\ZZ\dash$graded vector spaces.
The category consists of objects given by $V = \bigoplus_{i\in \ZZ} V_i$ and linear maps $f:V\to W$ such that $f(V_i) \subseteq W_i$ for all $i$.

We previously had vector spaces categorifying the natural numbers by taking the dimension, so for graded vector spaces, we take the *graded dimension* 
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{gr dim} \bigoplus_{i\in\ZZ}V_i = \sum_{i\in \ZZ}\qty{\dim V_i}v^i \in \ZZ^{\geq 0}[v, v\inv]
.\end{align*}

Goal:
We want to associate to an oriented link diagram $D$ a cochain complex of finite-dimensional graded $\CC\dash$vector spaces $C_i(D) \mapsvia{\bd} C_{i+1}(D) \to \cdots$.
Since each chain space decomposes, the differential does as well, and we get a large collection of chain complexes

\cdots \arrow[r] & {C_{i, 0}} \arrow[r, "{\bd_{i, 0}}"]   & {C_{i+1, 0}} \arrow[r]  & \cdots \\
\cdots \arrow[r] & {C_{i, -1}} \arrow[r, "{\bd_{i, -1}}"] & {C_{i+1, -1}} \arrow[r] & \cdots
\end{tikzcd}

This yields two gradings: the first is homological, the second is "internal".

We want the following:

1. If $D, D'$ are related by a finite sequence of Reidemeister moves, then $H_{i, j}(C_{\wait, \wait}(D)) = H_{i, j}(C_{\wait, \wait}(D')) = \ker \bd_{i, j} / \im \bd_{i-1, j}$ for all $i, j$.

2. $J(D) = \chi_{\gr}(C_{\wait, \wait}(D)) = \sum_{i\in \ZZ} (-1)^i \mathrm{gr dim} C_{\wait, \wait}(D)$.
  Note that you can also take the dimension of the homology instead, and at the end of the day this yields $\sum_{i\in \ZZ} (-1)^i v^j \dim(H_{i, j})$ (maybe need to sum over $j$)

For $A = \bigoplus A_i, B = \bigoplus B_i$, $a\in A$ is called *homogeneous* of degree $k$ if $a\in A_k$, i.e. it is a sum of basis elements from only the $k$th graded piece.
In this case we say $\abs a = k$.
We can union bases over all graded pieces to get a basis for the entire space.

For direct sums $A\oplus B$, a basis is given by $(\alpha_i, 0)$ and $(0, \beta_j)$.
We put $\alpha_i$ in degree $\abs{\alpha_i}$, in which case
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{gr dim}(A\oplus B) = \sum_{k\in \ZZ} \dim(\qty{A\oplus B}_k) v^k
= \sum_k \dim A_k v^k + \sum \dim B_k v^k = \mathrm{gr dim}(A) + \mathrm{gr dim}(B)
,\end{align*}
so taking direct sums commutes with taking graded dimensions.

Similarly for tensor products $A\tensor_\CC B$, we get a basis $\alpha_i \tensor \beta_j$ placed in degree $\abs{\alpha_i}  + \abs{\beta_j}$. 
Then (exercise)
\begin{align*}
\grdim(A\tensor_\CC B) = \grdim(A) \cdot \grdim(B)
.\end{align*}

We also have degree shifts by $i$ for any $i$, denote $A(i)$, where $A_j \mapsto A_{j+i}$ for every $j$.
Thus the $k$th graded piece is given by $(A(i))_k = A_{k-i}$, thus $\grdim(A(i)) = v^i \grdim(A)$.

Important example: $H^*(S^2; \CC)$ is $\CC$ in degrees 2 and 0 and zero elsewhere.
Let $A\definedas H^*(S^2; \CC)(-1)$ now has $\CC$ in degrees $\pm 1$, and $\grdim A = v + v\inv$.

Note that

- $(v+v\inv)^2$ corresponds to $A^{\tensor 2}$.
- $2v(v+v\inv)$ corresponds to $A(1)^{\oplus 2}$.
- $v^2(v+v\inv)$ corresponds to $A^{\tensor 2}(2)$.

So we can assemble these into a chain complex and take the Euler characteristic in order to recover the Kauffman bracket in the earlier example.

Theorem
:   There exists a unique isotopy invariant of oriented links in $\RR^3$ called $P(D) \in \CC(a, v)$, a rational function in two variables, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial.
    It satisfies

Example (The Hopf Link)
:   Yields
    \begin{align*}
    P(D) = -a(aia\inv) + a^2 \qty{a-a\inv \over v-v\inv}^2

# Ideas for Spaces

- Curves
  - Elliptic Curves
  - Higher genus
  - Hyperelliptic curves
  - The modular curve
- Surfaces
  - Compact Riemann surfaces
    - Bolza Surface (Genus 2)
    - Klein Quartic (Genus 3)
    - Hurwizt Surfaces
  - Kummer surfaces
  - Del Pezzo surfaces
- Compact Complex Surfaces
  - Rational ruled
  - Enriques Surfaces
  - $K3$
    - Kahler Manifolds
  - Kodaira
  - Toric
  - Hyperelliptic
  - Properly quasi-elliptic
  - General type
  - Type VII
- Fake projective planes 
- Conics
- Calabi-Yau manifolds
  - Dimension 1: All elliptic curves (up to homeomorphism)
  - Dimension 2: $K3$ surfaces
  - Dimension 3 (threefolds): 500 million +, unknown if infinitely many
  - The bananafold
- Hurwitz schemes
- Topological galois groups, e.g. $G(\bar F /F )$ for $F = \QQ, \FF_p$.
- $\spec (R)$ for $R$ a DVR (a Sierpinski space)
- Quiver Grassmannians
- Rigid analytic spaces
- Affine line with two origins
- Moduli stack of elliptic curves $\mathcal{M}_{1, 1}$.
- Abelian Surface
- Fano Varieties

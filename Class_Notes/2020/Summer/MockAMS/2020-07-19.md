  - Dimension 2: $K3$ surfaces
  - Dimension 3 (threefolds): 500 million +, unknown if infinitely many
  - The bananafold
  - Hyperkähler
- Hurwitz schemes
- Topological galois groups, e.g. $G(\bar F /F )$ for $F = \QQ, \FF_p$.
- $\spec (R)$ for $R$ a DVR (a Sierpinski space)

- Rigid analytic spaces
- Affine line with two origins
- Moduli stack of elliptic curves $\mathcal{M}_{1, 1}$.
- Abelian Surface
- Fano Varieties
 - Curves: isomorphic to $\PP^1$
 - Surfaces: Del Pezzo surfaces
- Weighted projective space
- Toric Varieties
- Grassmannian
- Flag Varieties
- Moduli Spaces

> Due to Kunihiko Kodaira's classification of complex surfaces, we know that any compact hyperkähler 4-manifold is either a K3 surface or a compact torus T^{4}. (Every Calabi–Yau manifold in 4 (real) dimensions is a hyperkähler manifold, because SU(2) is isomorphic to Sp(1).)

> As was discovered by Beauville, the Hilbert scheme of k points on a compact hyperkähler 4-manifold is a hyperkähler manifold of dimension 4k. This gives rise to two series of compact examples: Hilbert schemes of points on a K3 surface and generalized Kummer varieties.

# Intro/Motivation

> Partially inspired by Ursula Whitch

Assume the universe is a "space".
Which space is it?

# Analogies

> Notation: all dimensions are over $\RR$.

Impossible goal: pick a category, understand all of the objects and all of the maps.
Two main categories with a forgetful functor: $\mathbf{Diff} \to \mathbf{Top}$.
Question:

- What's in the "image" of this functor? (Manifolds that admit a differentiable structure.)
- What is the "fiber" above a given topological manifold? (Distinct differentiable structures)


Differentiable Manifolds: classified by geometric structure in low dimensions ($\leq 4$), algebraic data/methods in high dimensions


## Topological Category

Identify objects up to homeomorphism

- Initial object: empty set
- Dimension 0: The point (terminal object)
- 1-manifolds: $S^1, \RR$
- 2-manifolds: $\gens{\SS, \TT, \RP \suchthat \SS = 0, 3\RP = \RP + \TT }$. Classified by $\pi_1$ (orientability and "genus"). Riemann, Poincare, Klein.

## Smooth Category

- 2-manifolds: Homeomorphic $\iff$ diffeomorphic. Every surface admits a complex structure and a metric.
  - Uniformization: Conformally equivalent to a quotient of one of three spaces
    - $\CP^1$, positive curvature (spherical)   
    - $\DD^{\circ}$, zero curvature (flat)
    - $\HH$, negative curvature (hyperbolic)
- 3-manifolds: Thurston's Geometrization
  - Oriented prime 3-manifolds can be decomposed into geometric "pieces" of 8 possible types
  - Geometric structure: a diffeo $M\cong \tilde M/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a discrete Lie group acting freely/transitively on $X$
- 4-manifolds: classified in the topological category by surgery, but not in the smooth category
- $n\dash$manifolds, $n\geq 5$: classified by surgery

# Kahlers

- For complex manifold, replace Riemannian metric with a Hermitian metric (positive definite sesquilinear inner product on tangent bundle)
- If skew-symmetric part is symplectic (closed and nondegenerate) then the metric is Kahler
- Includes smooth projective varieties, but not all complex manifolds
- Specialize to Calabi-Yaus: compact and Ricci-flat, or first Chern class vanishes

# Calabi-Yaus

- As manifolds: Ricci-flat, i.e. Ricci curvature tensor vanishes (measures deviation of volumes of "geodesic balls" from Euclidean balls of the same radius).
- Applications: Physicists want to study $G_2$ manifolds (an exceptional Lie group, automorphisms of octonions), part of $M\dash$theory uniting several superstring theories, but no smooth or complex structures. 
  Indirect approach: compactify an 11-dimension space, one small $S^1$ dimension $\to$ 10 dimensions, 4 spacetime and 6 "small" Calabi-Yau.

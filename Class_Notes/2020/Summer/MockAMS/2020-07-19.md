  - Toric
  - Hyperelliptic
  - Properly quasi-elliptic
  - General type
  - Type VII
- Fake projective planes 
- Conics
- Calabi-Yau manifolds
  - Dimension 1: All elliptic curves (up to homeomorphism)
  - Dimension 2: $K3$ surfaces
  - Dimension 3 (threefolds): 500 million +, unknown if infinitely many
  - The bananafold
  - Hyperkähler
- Hurwitz schemes
- Topological galois groups, e.g. $G(\bar F /F )$ for $F = \QQ, \FF_p$.
- $\spec (R)$ for $R$ a DVR (a Sierpinski space)
- Quiver Grassmannians
- Rigid analytic spaces
- Affine line with two origins
- Moduli stack of elliptic curves $\mathcal{M}_{1, 1}$.
- Abelian Surface
- Fano Varieties
 - Curves: isomorphic to $\PP^1$
 - Surfaces: Del Pezzo surfaces
- Weighted projective space
- Toric Varieties
- Grassmannian
- Flag Varieties
- Moduli Spaces

> Due to Kunihiko Kodaira's classification of complex surfaces, we know that any compact hyperkähler 4-manifold is either a K3 surface or a compact torus T^{4}. (Every Calabi–Yau manifold in 4 (real) dimensions is a hyperkähler manifold, because SU(2) is isomorphic to Sp(1).)

> As was discovered by Beauville, the Hilbert scheme of k points on a compact hyperkähler 4-manifold is a hyperkähler manifold of dimension 4k. This gives rise to two series of compact examples: Hilbert schemes of points on a K3 surface and generalized Kummer varieties.


# Analogies

Manifolds: classified by geometric structure in low dimensions ($\leq 4$), algebraic in high dimensions

- 2-manifolds: Uniformization
  - Simply connected Riemann surfaces are conformally equivalent to one of $\HH, \DD^{\circ}, \CP^1$.
- 3-manifolds: Thurston's Geometrization
  - Oriented prime 3-manifolds can be decomposed into geometric "pieces" of 8 possible types
  - Geometric structure: a diffeo $M\cong \tilde M/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a discrete Lie group acting freely/transitively on $X$
- 4-manifolds: classified in the topological category by surgery, but not in the smooth category
- $n\dash$manifolds, $n\geq 5$: classified by surgery

title: Interesting Topological Spaces in Algebraic Geometry
---

# Ideas for Spaces

- Fake projective planes 
- Conics
- Elliptic Curves
- Kahler Manifolds
- K3 Surfaces
- Del Pezzo surfaces
- Hurwitz schemes
- Topological galois groups, e.g. $G(\bar F /F )$ for $F = \QQ, \FF_p$.
- $\spec (R)$ for $R$ a DVR (a Sierpinski space)
- Quiver Grassmannians
- Rigid analytic spaces


# Part 2

I don't quite know yet.


# Part 3

Some more stuff.

Even more stuff.

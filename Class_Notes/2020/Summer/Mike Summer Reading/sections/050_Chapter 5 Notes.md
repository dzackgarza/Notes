# Chapter 5: Submanifolds 

The most important type of manifolds: embedded submanifolds.
Most often described as the *level set* of a smooth map, but needs extra conditions.
The level sets of constant rank maps are always embedded submanifolds.


:::{.definition title="Embedded Submanifolds"}
For $S\subseteq M$ in the subspace topology, with a smooth structure such that the inclusion $S\injects M$ is smooth.
:::

:::{.definition title="Embedded Hypersurface"}
An embedded submanifold of codimension 1.
:::


:::{.proposition}
A subset $S\subseteq M$ of codimension zero is an embedded submanifold iff $S$ is an open submanifold.
:::

A way to produce submanifolds:
:::{.proposition}
If $F:N\to M$, then $F(N)$ is a submanifold of $M$ with the subspace topology and a unique smooth structure making $F$ a diffeomorphism onto its image and $F(N)\injects M$ and embedding.

# Chapter 3

Definition
: For a fixed point $p\in \RR^n$, define the *geometric tangent space* at $p$ to be the set
  \begin{align*}
  \RR^n_p \definedas p \cross \RR^n = \theset{(p, \vector v) \suchthat \vector p \in \RR^n}
  .\end{align*}

Notation: $v_a$ denotes the tangent vector at $v$, i.e. the pair $(a, v)$.
Think of this as a vector with its base at $a$.


Remark
: There is a natural isomorphism $\RR^n_a \cong \RR^n$ given by $(p, \vector v) \mapsto \vector v$.\todo{This map is not explicitly stated.}

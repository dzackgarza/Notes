# Chapter 1: Smooth Manifolds

Definition (Smooth Functions)
: A function $f:\RR^n \to \RR^m$ given by $\thevector{f_1(\vector x^n), f_2(\vector x^n), \cdots, f_m(\vector x^n)}$ (or any subsets thereof) is said to be $C^\infty$ or **smooth** iff each $f_i$ has continuous partial derivatives of all orders.

Definition (Diffeomorphism)
: A smooth bijective map with a smooth inverse is a *diffeomorphism*.

Note that a diffeomorphism is a homeomorphism.

Definition (Transition Maps)
:   If $(U, \phi), (V, \psi)$ are two charts on $M$ such that $U\intersect V \neq \emptyset$, the compositve map $\psi \circ \phi\inv: \phi(U\intersect V) \to \psi(U\intersect V)$ is a function $\RR^n\to\RR^n$ and is called the *transition map* from $\phi$ to $\psi$.

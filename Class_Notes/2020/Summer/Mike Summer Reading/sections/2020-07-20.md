# Chapter 3

Three categories of maps:

- Submersions: everywhere surjective differentials (analogy: quotient maps)
- Immersions: everywhere injective differentials,
- Embeddings: injective immersions that are homeomorphisms onto their images.


Definition (Rank)
: If $F:M \to N$ is a smooth map of manifolds and $p\in M$, then the *rank of $F$ at $p$* is the rank of the linear map $dF_p: T_p M \to T_{F(p)} N$

This is equivalently the rank of the Jacobian of $F$ in any chart, or the dimension of $\im dF_p \subseteq T_{F(p)}N$.
The rank may vary from point to point.

$\rank(F)$ is bounded above by $\min \theset{\dim M, \dim N}$; if it achieves this maximum we say $F$ has full rank.

# Chapter 3

Three categories of maps:

- Submersions: everywhere surjective differentials (analogy: quotient maps)
- Immersions: everywhere injective differentials,
- Embeddings: injective immersions that are homeomorphisms onto their images.


Definition (Rank)
: If $F:M \to N$ is a smooth map of manifolds and $p\in M$, then the *rank of $F$ at $p$* is the rank of the linear map $dF_p: T_p M \to T_{F(p)} N$

This is equivalently the rank of the Jacobian of $F$ in any chart, or the dimension of $\im dF_p \subseteq T_{F(p)}N$.
The rank may vary from point to point.

$\rank(F)$ is bounded above by $\min \theset{\dim M, \dim N}$; if it achieves this maximum we say $F$ has full rank.


Definition (Submersion)
: A smooth map $F:M\to N$ is a *submersion* iff $dF_p$ is surjective for every $p\in M$, or equivalently $F$ has constant rank $\rank(F) = \dim N$.

  > Analogy: surjective linear maps.

Definition (Immersion)
: A smooth map $F:M\to N$ is an *immersion* iff $dF_p$ is injective for every $p\in M$, or equivalently $F$ is of constant rank $\rank(F) = \dim M$.

  > Analogy: injective linear maps.



Proposition
: If $F:M\to N$ and $dF_p$ is surjective (resp. injective) at a point, then there exists a neighborhood $U \ni p$ such that $F$ restricted to $U$ is a submersion (resp. immersion).

Proof
: Go to charts.
  The set of $m\times n$ matrices of full rank is open in $\mat(m\times n, \RR)$ and the Jacobian is a continuous function of its entries.


Examples
:   \hfill

    - Coordinate projections $\pi_i: \prod_{j=1}^n M_j \to M_i$ are smooth submersions.
    - $\gamma: I \to M$ a smooth surve is a smooth immersion $\iff \gamma'(t) \neq 0$ for all $t\in I$.
    - The projection $TM\to M$ is a smooth submersion. 

Exercise
: Show that smooth submersions are closed under composition, as are smooth immersions, but not maps of constant rank.

Definition (Local Diffeomorphism)
: A map $F:M\to N$ is a *local diffeomorphism* iff every $p\in M$ has a neighborhood $U\ni p$ such that $F(U) \subseteq N$ is open and $\restrictionof{F}{U}:U\to F(U)$ is a diffeomorphism.

Theorem (Inverse Function Theorem)
: If $p\in M$ and $dF_p$ is invertible, then there are connected neighborhoods $U\ni p$ and $V\ni F(p)$ such that $\restrictionof{F}{U}:U\to V$ is a diffeomorphism.

Theorem (Inverse Function Theorem, Rudin's Version)
: If $f$ is a $C^1$ mapping of open subsets $M\subseteq \RR^m\to \RR^n\supseteq N$ and $f'(p)$ is invertible for some $p\in M$, then there exists $U\ni p$ and $V\ni f(p)$ such that $\restrictionof{f}{U}:U\to V$ is a bijection with $C^1$ inverse.

Note that this can fail if $\bd M \neq \emptyset$, but will hold when $F(M)\subseteq N^\circ$.
This *always* happens at points $p$ where $dF_p$ is invertible.

Proposition
:   \hfill

    1. $F$ is a local diffeomorphism $\iff F$ is an immersion and a submersion.
    2. If $\dim M = \dim N$ and $F$ is *either* an immersion or a submersion, then $F$ is a local diffeomorphism.

Proof
:   \hfill

    1. Find a neighborhood $U\ni p$ on which $F: U \to F(U)$ is a diffeomorphism, then $dF_p: T_p M \mapsvia{\cong} T_{F(p)}N$ is an isomorphism, so $\rank(F) = \dim M = \dim N$ and $F$ is an immersion and a submersion.

      Conversely, if $dF_p$ is an isomorphism at each point, the inverse function theorem supplies neighborhoods on which $F$ is a diffeomorphism.

    2. If $\dim M = \dim N$ then either injectivity or surjectivity of $dF_p$ implies bijectivity.

Theorem (Rank Theorem)
:   If $F:M\to N$ with $\dim(M) = m,~\dim(N) = n$ and about each $p\in M$ there exist charts for which $F$ has a coordinate representation

  \begin{align*}
  \hat F(x^1, \cdots, x^r, x^{r+1}, \cdots, x^m) = (x^1, \cdots, x^r, 0, \cdots, 0) \\
  \hat F(x^1, \cdots, x^n, x^{n+1}, \cdots, x^m) = (x^1, \cdots, x^n) \quad\text{if $F$ is a submersion} \\
  \hat F(x^1, \cdots, x^n, x^{n+1}, \cdots, x^m) = (x^1, \cdots, x^m, 0, \cdots, 0) \quad\text{if $F$ is an immersion}\\
  .\end{align*}

  I.e., submersions are projections onto the first $n = \dim N$ coordinates, and immersions are inclusions of the first $m=\dim M$ coordinates.

# Chapter 3

Three categories of maps:

- Submersions: everywhere surjective differentials (analogy: quotient maps)
- Immersions: everywhere injective differentials,
- Embeddings: injective immersions that are homeomorphisms onto their images.


Definition (Rank)
: If $F:M \to N$ is a smooth map of manifolds and $p\in M$, then the *rank of $F$ at $p$* is the rank of the linear map $dF_p: T_p M \to T_{F(p)} N$

This is equivalently the rank of the Jacobian of $F$ in any chart, or the dimension of $\im dF_p \subseteq T_{F(p)}N$.
The rank may vary from point to point.

$\rank(F)$ is bounded above by $\min \theset{\dim M, \dim N}$; if it achieves this maximum we say $F$ has full rank.


Definition (Submersion)
: A smooth map $F:M\to N$ is a *submersion* iff $dF_p$ is surjective for every $p\in M$, or equivalently $F$ has constant rank $\rank(F) = \dim N$.

  > Analogy: surjective linear maps.

Definition (Immersion)
: A smooth map $F:M\to N$ is an *immersion* iff $dF_p$ is injective for every $p\in M$, or equivalently $F$ is of constant rank $\rank(F) = \dim M$.

  > Analogy: injective linear maps.



Proposition
: If $F:M\to N$ and $dF_p$ is surjective (resp. injective) at a point, then there exists a neighborhood $U \ni p$ such that $F$ restricted to $U$ is a submersion (resp. immersion).

Proof
: Go to charts.
  The set of $m\times n$ matrices of full rank is open in $\mat(m\times n, \RR)$ and the Jacobian is a continuous function of its entries.


Examples
:   \hfill

    - Coordinate projections $\pi_i: \prod_{j=1}^n M_j \to M_i$ are smooth submersions.
    - $\gamma: I \to M$ a smooth surve is a smooth immersion $\iff \gamma'(t) \neq 0$ for all $t\in I$.
    - The projection $TM\to M$ is a smooth submersion. 

Exercise
: Show that smooth submersions are closed under composition, as are smooth immersions, but not maps of constant rank.

# Chapter 1 

Definition (Topological Manifold)
:   A topological space $M$ that satisfies

    1. $M$ is Hausdorff, i.e. points can be separated by open sets
    2. $M$ is second-countable, i.e. has a countable basis
    3. $M$ is locally Euclidean, i.e. every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset $\hat U$ of $\RR^n$ for some fixed $n$.


The last property says $p\in M \implies \exists U$ with $p\in U \subseteq M$, $\hat U\subseteq \RR^n$, and a homeomorphism $\phi: U \to \hat U$.

> Note that second countability is primarily needed for existence of partitions of unity.

Exercise
: Show that the in the last condition, $\hat U$ can equivalently be required to be an open ball or $\RR^n$ itself.


Theorem (Topological Invariance of Dimension)
: Two nonempty topological manifolds of different dimensions can not be homeomorphic.


Exercise
: Show that in a Hausdorff space, finite subsets are closed and limits of convergent sequences are unique.

Exercise
: Show that subspaces and finite products of Hausdorff (resp. second countable) spaces are again Hausdorff (resp. second countable).

Every open subset of a topological manifold with the subspace topology is again a topological manifold.

Exercise
: Give an example of a connected, locally Euclidean Hausdorff space that is not second countable.

Definition (Charts)
: A chart on $M$ is a pair $(U, \phi)$ where $U\subseteq M$ is open and $\phi: U \to \hat U$ is a homeormohpsim from $U$ to $\hat U = \phi(U) \subseteq \RR^n$.

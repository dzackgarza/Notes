Definition (Topological Manifold)
:   A topological space $M$ that satisfies

    1. $M$ is Hausdorff, i.e. points can be separated by open sets
    2. $M$ is second-countable, i.e. has a countable basis
    3. $M$ is locally Euclidean, i.e. every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset $\hat U$ of $\RR^n$ for some fixed $n$.


The last property says $p\in M \implies \exists U$ with $p\in U \subseteq M$, $\hat U\subseteq \RR^n$, and a homeomorphism $\phi: U \to \hat U$.

> Note that second countability is primarily needed for existence of partitions of unity.

Exercise
: Show that the in the last condition, $\hat U$ can equivalently be required to be an open ball or $\RR^n$ itself.


Theorem (Topological Invariance of Dimension)
: Two nonempty topological manifolds of different dimensions can not be homeomorphic.


Exercise
: Show that in a Hausdorff space, finite subsets are closed and limits of convergent sequences are unique.

Exercise
: Show that subspaces and finite products of Hausdorff (resp. second countable) spaces are again Hausdorff (resp. second countable).

Every open subset of a topological manifold with the subspace topology is again a topological manifold.

Exercise
: Give an example of a connected, locally Euclidean Hausdorff space that is not second countable.

Definition (Charts)
: A chart on $M$ is a pair $(U, \phi)$ where $U\subseteq M$ is open and $\phi: U \to \hat U$ is a homeormohpsim from $U$ to $\hat U = \phi(U) \subseteq \RR^n$.
  If $p\in M$ and $\phi(p) = 0 \in \bar U$, then the chart is said to be *centered* at $p$.
  Note that any chart about $p$ can be modified to a chart $(\phi_1, \hat U_1)$ that is centered at $p$ by defining $\phi_1(x) = x - \phi(v)$.

  $U$ is the *coordinate domain* and $\phi$ is the *coordinate map*.

  Note that we can write $\phi$ in components as $\phi(p) = \thevector{x^1(p), \cdots, x^n(p)}$ where each $x^i$ is a map $x^i: U \to \RR$.
  The component functions $x^i$ are the *local coordinates* on $U$.

Shorthand notation: $\thevector{x^i} \definedas \thevector{x^1, \cdots, x^n}$.

Example (Graphs of Continuous Functions)
:   Define 
    \begin{align*}
    \Gamma(f) = \theset{(x, y) \in \RR^{n} \cross \RR^{k} \suchthat x\in U,~ y = f(x) \in \hat U }
    .\end{align*}

    This is a topological manifold since we can take $\phi: \Gamma(f) \to U$ by restricting $\pi_1: \RR^{n}\cross \RR^k \to \RR^n$ to the subspace $\Gamma(f)$.
    Projections are continuous, restrictions of continuous functions are continuous. 
    
    This is a homeomorphism because the map $g: x \mapsto (x, f(x))$ is continuous and $g\circ \pi_1 = \id_{\RR^n}$ is continuous with $\pi_1 \circ g = \id_{\Gamma(f)}$.
    Note that $U \cong \Gamma(f)$, and thus $(U, \phi) = (\Gamma(f), \phi)$ is a single *global* coordinate chart, called the *graph coordinates* of $f$.

Note that this works elsewhere: take coordinates take the identity coordinate $x_i(x) = x$ for $1\leq i \leq n$, then replace any $k\leq n$ of these coordinates with any continuous functions of the remaining $n-k$ coordinates.

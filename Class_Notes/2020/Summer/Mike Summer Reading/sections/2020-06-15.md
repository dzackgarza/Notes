# Chapter 1 

Definition (Topological Manifold)
:   A topological space $M$ that satisfies

    1. $M$ is Hausdorff, i.e. points can be separated by open sets
    2. $M$ is second-countable, i.e. has a countable basis
    3. $M$ is locally Euclidean, i.e. every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset $V$ of $\RR^n$ for some fixed $n$.

    The last property says $p\in M \implies \exists U$ with $p\in U \subseteq M$, $V\subseteq \RR^n$, and a homeomorphism $\phi: U \to V$.


Exercise
: Show that the in the last condition, $V$ can equivalently be required to be an open ball or $\RR^n$ itself.

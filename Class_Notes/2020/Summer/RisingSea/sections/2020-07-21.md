Exercise (2.3.C)
:   Suppose $F, G$ are two sheaves of sets on $(X, \tau_x)$ and define the sheaf
    \begin{align*}
    \mathcal{Hom}i(F, G): \tau_{X}^{\text{op}} &\to \sets \\
    \hom_{\text{Sheaf}}\qty{ \restrictionof{F}{U}, \restrictionof{G}{U} }
    .\end{align*}
    where $\tau_X^{\text{op}}$ is the poset category on the open subsets of $X$ under inclusion and $\mathrm{Mor}$ is the set of morphisms.
    Show that this is a sheaf.

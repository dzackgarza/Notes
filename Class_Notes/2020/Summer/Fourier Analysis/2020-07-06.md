We define $e(n\theta) \definedas e^{2\pi i n \theta}$ where $n\in \ZZ$ and $\theta \in \RR/\ZZ$, i.e. $\theta \in [0, 1]$.
Note that $e(n(\theta + t)) = e(n\theta)$ for $t\in \ZZ$.

We'll define a Fourier series as a sum $\sum_{n\in \ZZ} f(n) e(n\theta)$, which may or may not converge.
We'll restrict our attention to coefficient functions $f$ which are supported on finite subsets $A\subset \ZZ$, in which case the sum is a bona fide function.

Note that if the phase $n$ is zero, then $\int_0^1 e(n\theta) \,d\theta = \int_0^1 \cos(2\pi n \theta) + i\sin(2\pi n \theta)$. 
But these are periodic functions, which integrates to zero unless the integrand is constant.

Thus
\begin{align*}
\int_0^1 e(n\theta) \, d\theta = \indic{n = 0}
.\end{align*}

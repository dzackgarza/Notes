Theorem:
Let $f: M \to \RR$ be morse with critical points $p_1, \cdots, p_k$.
Then $f$ can be approximated by a morse function $g$ such that 

1. $g$ has the same critical points of $f$
2. $g(p_i) \neq g(p_j)$ for all $i\neq j$.


> Idea: Change $f$ gradually near critical points without actually changing the critical points themselves.

Proof:
Suppose $f(p_1) = f(p_2)$.

Choose $\bar U \subset N$ open neighborhoods of $p_1$ such that $\bar N$ doesn't contain $p_i$ for any $i$ except for 1.
Note that this is possible because the critical points are isolated.

Choose a bump function $\lambda \equiv 1$ on $U$ and $0$ on $M\setminus N$.
Now let $f_1 = f + \varepsilon \lambda$, where we'll see how to choose $\varepsilon$ small enough soon.

Let $K \definedas \theset{ x \suchthat 0 < \lambda(x) < 1 }$, which is compact.
Note that $f$ has no critical points in $K$.

Pick a Riemannian metric on $M$, then we can talk about gradients.
Recall that $\grad f$ is the vector field that satisfies $\inner{X}{f}$ for all vector fields $X$ on $M$.
Because $f$ has no critical points in $K$, $X(f)$ is nonzero for some field $X$, so $\grad f$ is nonzero.

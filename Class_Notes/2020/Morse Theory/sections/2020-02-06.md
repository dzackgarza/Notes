Cancellation:
Let $f: W \to I$ be Morse, $\crit(f) = \theset{p, q}$ with $f(p) < f(q)$ and $\ind(p) = \lambda,~\ind(q) = \lambda+1$.
Let $\xi$ be its gradient-like vector field, then $S_R^c(p) \intersect S_L^c(q) = \pt$, so there exists a unique integral curve $T$ from $p$ to $q$.

In this situation $W$ is diffeomorphic to the product cobordism.
We will show

1. We can change $\xi$ in a compact neighborhood of $T$ to get a nonvanishing vector field $\xi'$ for which the integral curves originate at $M_0$ and end at $M_1$.

Cancellation:
Let $f: W \to I$ be Morse, $\crit(f) = \theset{p, q}$ with $f(p) < f(q)$ and $\ind(p) = \lambda,~\ind(q) = \lambda+1$.
Let $\xi$ be its gradient-like vector field, then $S_R^c(p) \intersect S_L^c(q) = \pt$, so there exists a unique integral curve $T$ from $p$ to $q$.

In this situation $W$ is diffeomorphic to the product cobordism.


We will show

**Theorem 1:**
We can change $\xi$ in a compact neighborhood of $T$ to get a nonvanishing vector field $\xi'$ for which the integral curves originate at $M_0$ and end at $M_1$.

Example:

Moreover, it takes a particularly nice standard form:

There exists a neighborhood $U_T$ and a coordinate chart $h: U_T \to \RR^n$ such that

1. $h(p) = (0, \cdots, 0)$ and $h(q) = (1, 0, \cdots, 0)$.

2. $h_* \xi = (V(x_1), -x_2, -x_3, \cdots, -x_{\lambda+1}, x_{\lambda+2}, \cdots, x_n)$.

**Theorem (Rearrangement):**
If a Morse function $f$ has 2 critical points with $f(p) < c < f(q)$ and $\ind(p) \geq \ind(q)$, then $\xi$ can be perturbed in a neighborhood of $f\inv(c)$ such that $W_p^s \intersect W_q^u = \emptyset$.

**First Cancellation:**
If $S_R \transverse S_L' = \theset{\pt}$, then the cobordism is diffeomorphic to a product.

**Second Cancellation:**
Suppose $(W, V_0, V_1)$ is a cobordism and $f: W\to \RR$ has two critical points.
If $S_R \cdot S_L' = \pm 1$, then $W^n \cong V_0 \cross [0, 1]$.

**Whitney's Trick:**
If $M, M' = M^m, M^n \subset V^{m+n}$ are closed submanifolds with $M\transverse M'$ such that $M, \nu(M')$ (the normal bundle) are oriented.
Assume $m+n \geq 5$ and $n\geq 3$, and if $m=1,2$ then assume $\pi_1(V\setmius M') \injects \pi_1(V)$.

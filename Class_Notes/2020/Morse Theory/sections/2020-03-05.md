Theorem
: Let $(W, V, V')$ be a cobordism of dimension $n\geq 6$, $f$ Morse with all critical points of indices in $[2, \cdots, n-2]$.
  Suppose $m=0$ (?) and $H_*(W, V) = 0$; then this is homotopic (?) to the product cobordism.

Proof
:   Factor $c = c_2 c_3 \cdots c_{n-2}$; then from $H_*(W, V) = 0$ we have
    \begin{align*}
    0 \to C_{n-2} \mapsvia{\del} C_{n-3} \to \cdots \to C_2 \to 0
    ,\end{align*}
    which has zero homology.

    Thus for all $\lambda$, choose $\theset{z_1^{\lambda+1}, \cdots, z_{k_{\lambda+1}}^{\lambda+1}  }$ as basis of $\ker C_{\lambda+1} \to C_\lambda$.

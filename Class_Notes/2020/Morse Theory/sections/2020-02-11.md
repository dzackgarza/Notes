## Cancellation

The setup:
$f: W \to [0, 1]$ a morse function with $\crit(f) = \theset{p, q}$ with $\ind(p) = \lambda$ and $\ind(q) = \lambda + 1$, with a gradient-like vector field $\xi$ such that there exists a *single* flow line $T$ from $p$ to $q$.

Lemma:
There exists a gradient-like vector field $\xi'$ for $f$ such that

1. $T$ is still the single flow line from $p$ to $q$.

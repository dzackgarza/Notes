## Cancellation

The setup:
$f: W \to [0, 1]$ a morse function with $\crit(f) = \theset{p, q}$ with $\ind(p) = \lambda$ and $\ind(q) = \lambda + 1$, with a gradient-like vector field $\xi$ such that there exists a *single* flow line $T$ from $p$ to $q$.

Lemma:
There exists a gradient-like vector field $\xi'$ for $f$ such that

1. $T$ is still the single flow line from $p$ to $q$.
2. $\xi'$ is *standard* in a neighborhood $U_T$ of $T$, i.e. there exists $h: U_T \to \RR^n$ such that $h(p) = (0, 0, \cdots, 0)$, $h(q) = (1, 0,\cdots, 0)$,
  $h(T)$ is contained in the $x\dash$axis, and $h_* \xi' = (V(x_1), -x_2, \cdots, -x_{\lambda+1}, x_{\lambda+2}, \cdots, x_n)$,
  where $V$ satisfies the property that near 0 and 1, $\abs{V'} = 1$:

Proof:

Let $\eta = V(x_1)$ from above.
Define the following vector field:

\begin{align*}
F(\vector x) = f(p) + 2 \int_0^{x_1} v(t) ~dt -x_2^2 - x_3^2 - \cdots x_{\lambda+1}^2 \cdots + x_n^2
.\end{align*}

Then $\eta$ is gradient-like for $F$, and we can pick $v(t)$ such that

\begin{align*}
F(1, 0, \cdots, 0) &=
f(p) + 2\int_0^1 v(t) ~dt &= f(q) \\
\implies \int_0^1 v(t) &= \frac{1}{2}\qty{ f(q) - f(p)  }
.\end{align*}

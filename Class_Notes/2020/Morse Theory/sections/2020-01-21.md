# Elementary Cobordism

Recall that an elementary cobordism is a cobordism that has a Morse function with exactly one critical point.

Definition:
An $n\dash$dimensional $\lambda\dash$handle is a copy of $D^{\lambda} \times D^{n-\lambda}$ which is attached to $\bd M^n$ via an embedding $\phi: \bd D^\lambda \cross D^{n-\lambda} \injects \bd M$.

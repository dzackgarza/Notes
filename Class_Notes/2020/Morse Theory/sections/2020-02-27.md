Setup: $M^m, N^n \subset V^{m+n}$ closed submanifolds, $M\transverse N$, $M$ oriented (i.e. an orientation of $TM)$ and $N$ co-oriented (i.e. an orientation $\nu_N = TM/TV$).

Each $p\in M\intersect N$ has a sign $\eps(p) \in \theset{-1, 1}$.
If $p, q \in M\intersect N$ with $\eps(p) = 1, \eps(1) = -1$, we would like an isotopy $(h_t)_{0 \leq t \leq 1}$ of $V$ such that $h_0 = \id$ and $h(M) \intersect N = (M\intersect N) \setminus\theset{p, q}$.

Idea: we want to push $M$ off of $N$:

From last week, assume $\dim V \geq 5$ and $\dim N \geq 3$ and $\pi_1(V\setminus N) = \pi(V) = 0$.

> Why? In the 2-dimensional model above, we want the disc in the middle to be contractible.

Then there is a smooth embedding $\phi_3: U \to V

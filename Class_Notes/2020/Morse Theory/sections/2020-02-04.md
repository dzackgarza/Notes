Recall:
$f: W \to I$ Morse, $\crit(F) = \theset{p, q}$ where $f(p) < f(q)$, and $\xi$ a gradient-like vector field for $f$.

Theorem:
If $W^*(p) \intersect W^*(q) = \emptyset$ then for any $a, b\in (0 ,1)$ we can change $f$ "nicely" to a new Morse function $g$ such that $g(p) = a$ and $g(q) = b$.

Note that these are disjoint iff $W^u(p) \intersect W^s(q) = \emptyset$ iff $S_R^c(p) \intersect S_L^c(q) = \emptyset$.
If $\in(p) \geq \in (q)$ then $\dim S_R^c(p) = \dim S_L^c(q) < n-1 = \dim f\inv(c)$.

*Lemma 1:*
For $M^m, N^n \subset V^v$ submanifolds with $m+n < v$, there exists a diffeomorphism $h: V \to V$ smoothly isotopic to $\id_V$ such that $h(M) \intersect N = \emptyset$.

> I.e. low enough dimension submanifolds can smoothly be made disjoint.

Lemma 2:
Let $f: W\to I$ be Morse with gradient-like vector field $\xi$ and regular value $x\in (0, 1)$.
Let $h: f\inv (c) \to f\inv(c)$ be smoothly isotopic to the identity, and define $M \definedas f\inv(c)$.

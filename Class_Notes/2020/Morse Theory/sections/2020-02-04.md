Recall:
$f: W \to I$ Morse, $\crit(F) = \theset{p, q}$ where $f(p) < f(q)$, and $\xi$ a gradient-like vector field for $f$.

Theorem:
If $W^*(p) \intersect W^*(q) = \emptyset$ then for any $a, b\in (0 ,1)$ we can change $f$ "nicely" to a new Morse function $g$ such that $g(p) = a$ and $g(q) = b$.

Note that these are disjoint iff $W^u(p) \intersect W^s(q) = \emptyset$ iff $S_R^c(p) \intersect S_L^c(q) = \emptyset$.

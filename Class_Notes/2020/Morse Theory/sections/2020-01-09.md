**Recall:**
For $M^n$ a closed smooth manifold, consider a smooth map $f: M^n \to \RR$.

**Definition:**
A critical point $p$ of $f$ is *non-degenerate* iff $\det( H\definedas \frac{\del^i f}{\del x_i \del x_j}(p)) \neq 0$ in some coordinate system $U$.

**Lemma (The Morse Lemma)**:
For any non-degenerate critical point $p$ there exists a coordinate system around $p$ such that

\begin{align*}
f(x_1, \cdots, x_n) = f(p) - x_1^2 - x_2^2 - \cdots - x_\lambda^2 + x_{\lambda+1}^2 + \cdots + x_n^2
.\end{align*}

$\lambda$ is called the *index of $f$ at $p$*.

**Lemma:**
$\lambda$ is equal to the number of *negative* eigenvalues of $H(p)$.

*Proof:*
A change of coordinates sends $H(p) \to A^t H(p) A$, which has the same eigenvalues.

This means that $f$ can be written as the quadratic form

\begin{align*}
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
-2 & 0 \\
-2 & 0 \\
-2 & 0 \\
-2 & 0 \\
\end{array}\right]
.\end{align*}

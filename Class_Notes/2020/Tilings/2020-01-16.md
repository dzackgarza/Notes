Recall:
Start with a translation surface with cone points with angles $2\pi n i$.
This yields a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ and a holomorphic $1\dash$form $\omega$ with zeros of order $n_i -1$.

Given a square fundamental domain, there is an automorphism given by rotating 90 degrees.
In charts, this is multiplication by $i$ and possibly a translation, which is holomorphic.

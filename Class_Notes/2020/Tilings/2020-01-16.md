Recall:
Start with a translation surface with cone points with angles $2\pi n i$.
This yields a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ and a holomorphic $1\dash$form $\omega$ with zeros of order $n_i -1$.

Given a square fundamental domain, there is an order 4 automorphism given by rotating 90 degrees.
In charts, this is multiplication by $i$ and possibly a translation, which is a holomorphic map $f: \Sigma \selfmap$.
We then have $f^*(dz) = d(f(z)) = idz$, so $dz$ is an eigenvector for $f^*$.

An elliptic curve can be specified by $y^2 = f_4(x)$ for a degree 4 polynomial, so we can obtain it as a double branched cover of $S^2$.
(i.e. glue along the slits joining pairs of roots)

Take $E : y^2 = x^4 - 1$, this is the only elliptic curve with an order 4 automorphism.
In coordinates, this is generated by $(x, y) \mapsto (-ix ,y)$.
So $\omega = c \frac{dx}{y}$, i.e. $dx/y$ up to scaling, and $f^*(dx/y) = i \frac{dx}{y}$.
What is the constant $c$?

Take closed cycles on $E$ given by $\alpha, \beta$ (see diagram), then by FTC $\int_\alpha \omega = z \mid_0^1 = 1$.
Negation is 4 fixed points on the elliptic curve, the 2-torsion points.

We can then compute

\begin{align*}
I = \int_\alpha  \frac{dx}{y} = \int_1^2 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^4 - 1}} 
.\end{align*}

and since $2c I = 1$, this uniquely determines $c$.

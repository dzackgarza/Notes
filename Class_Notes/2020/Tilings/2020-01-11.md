title: Notes on Tilings

# From Class

Motivation: Gauss' Unicursal Problem.
How many distinct curves $\alpha: I \to \RR^2$ with are there with no triple crossings?

Note that if we compactify the plane to the Riemann sphere (and possibly take the curve to be piecewise linear) then we obtain a *tiling* of the sphere.
We can also take a *dual tiling* by taking the barycenters of each polygon and connecting them by an edge iff their corresponding polygons share an edge.

Definition:
A *translation surface* is the 2-dimensional topological manifold obtained by taking any set of polygons in $\RR^2$ and gluing their edges by translations.

Example:
Any elliptic curve (topologically a torus).

We take equivalence up to cutting, pasting, and rearranging.

Lemma:
Two elliptic curves (of genus 2) are isomorphic iff the translation surfaces differ by a homothety, i.e. a rotation and scaling.

> Note: we will eventually see that the data of a translation surface is equivalently a holomorphic 1-form.

Definition:
A *half-translation surface* is a translation surface where we now additionally allow gluing by rotations of $\pi$ radians.

Example:

\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{pgfonlayer}{nodelayer}
		\node[fill=black, shape=circle]  (0) at (-3, 3) {};
		\node[fill=black, shape=circle]  (1) at (3, 3) {};
		\node[fill=black, shape=circle]  (2) at (-3, -3) {};
		\node[fill=black, shape=circle]  (3) at (3, -3) {};
		\node[fill=black, shape=circle]  (4) at (0, 3) {};
		\node[fill=black, shape=circle]  (5) at (0, -3) {};
	\end{pgfonlayer}
	\begin{pgfonlayer}{edgelayer}
		\draw (1.center) to node [auto] {$a$} (3.center);
		\draw (0.center) to node [left] {$a$} (2.center);
		\draw (0.center) to node [above] {$b$} (4.center);
		\draw (4.center) to node [above] {$b$} (1.center);
		\draw (2.center) to node [below] {$c$} (5.center);
		\draw (5.center) to node [below] {$c$} (3.center);
	\end{pgfonlayer}
\end{tikzpicture}

> Note that the gluing $b$ now requires a rotation.

This glues to a "hot pocket" surface:

\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
	\begin{pgfonlayer}{nodelayer}
		\node [style=none] (0) at (-3, 3) {};
		\node [style=none] (1) at (3, 3) {};
		\node [style=none] (2) at (-3, -4) {};
		\node [style=none] (3) at (3, -4) {};
		\node [style=none] (4) at (-3, 2) {};
		\node [style=none] (5) at (3, 2) {};
		\node [style=none] (6) at (-3, -0.5) {};
		\node [style=none] (7) at (3, -0.5) {};
		\node [style=none] (8) at (-3, -2.75) {};
		\node [style=none] (9) at (3, -2.75) {};
	\end{pgfonlayer}
	\begin{pgfonlayer}{edgelayer}
		\draw (0.center) to (2.center);
		\draw (2.center) to (3.center);
		\draw (3.center) to (1.center);
		\draw (0.center) to (1.center);
		\draw [bend right] (4.center) to (5.center);
		\draw[dotted] [bend left=15] (4.center) to (5.center);
		\draw [bend right] (6.center) to (7.center);
		\draw[dotted] [bend left=15] (6.center) to (7.center);
		\draw [bend right] (8.center) to (9.center);
		\draw[dotted] [bend left=15] (8.center) to (9.center);
	\end{pgfonlayer}
\end{tikzpicture}


**Lemma:**
Any game of *rectangular billiards* yields a half-translation surface.

Given any domain for rectangular billiards, we inflate it to a surface:

\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
	\begin{pgfonlayer}{nodelayer}
		\node [style=none] (0) at (-5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (2) at (0, 0) {};
		\node [style=none] (3) at (0, 4) {};
		\node [style=none] (4) at (3, 4) {};
		\node [style=none] (5) at (3, 2) {};
		\node [style=none] (6) at (6, 2) {};
		\node [style=none] (7) at (6, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (8) at (-5, 0) {};
		\node [style=none] (9) at (-2.5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (10) at (-2.5, 0) {};
		\node [style=none] (11) at (1.5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (12) at (1.5, 4) {};
		\node [style=none] (13) at (4.5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (14) at (4.5, 2) {};
	\end{pgfonlayer}
	\begin{pgfonlayer}{edgelayer}
		\draw (0.center) to (8.center);
		\draw (8.center) to (2.center);
		\draw (2.center) to (3.center);
		\draw (3.center) to (4.center);
		\draw (4.center) to (5.center);
		\draw (5.center) to (6.center);
		\draw (6.center) to (7.center);
		\draw (0.center) to (7.center);
		\draw [bend right] (9.center) to (10.center);
		\draw[dotted] [bend left=15] (9.center) to (10.center);
		\draw [bend right=40] (11.center) to (12.center);
		\draw[dotted] [bend left=40, looseness=0.75] (11.center) to (12.center);
		\draw [bend right, looseness=0.75] (13.center) to (14.center);
		\draw[dotted] [bend left=15] (13.center) to (14.center);
	\end{pgfonlayer}
\end{tikzpicture}

We can then cut along everything but the bottom edge to "unwrap" it into a half-translation surface:

\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
	\begin{pgfonlayer}{nodelayer}
		\node [style=none] (0) at (-5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (2) at (0, 0) {};
		\node [style=none] (3) at (0, 4) {};
		\node [style=none] (4) at (3, 4) {};
		\node [style=none] (5) at (3, 2) {};
		\node [style=none] (6) at (6, 2) {};
		\node [style=none] (7) at (6, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (8) at (-5, 0) {};
		\node [style=none] (9) at (-2.5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (10) at (-2.5, 0) {};
		\node [style=none] (11) at (1.5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (12) at (1.5, 4) {};
		\node [style=none] (13) at (4.5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (14) at (4.5, 2) {};
		\node [style=none] (17) at (-5, -6) {};
		\node [style=none] (18) at (6, -6) {};
		\node [style=none] (22) at (0, -4) {};
		\node [style=none] (23) at (3, -4) {};
		\node [style=none] (24) at (6, -2) {};
		\node [style=none] (29) at (3, -2) {};
	\end{pgfonlayer}
	\begin{pgfonlayer}{edgelayer}
		\draw (0.center) to node [auto] {$a$} (8.center);
		\draw (8.center) to (2.center);
		\draw (2.center) to node [auto] {$b$}  (3.center);
		\draw (3.center) to (4.center);
		\draw (4.center) to (5.center);
		\draw (5.center) to (6.center);
		\draw (6.center) to (7.center);
		\draw (0.center) to (7.center);
		\draw (8.center) to node [auto] {$a$} (17.center);
		\draw (17.center) to (18.center);
		\draw (2.center) to  node [auto] {$b$} (22.center);
		\draw (22.center) to (23.center);
		\draw (23.center) to (29.center);
		\draw (29.center) to (24.center);
		\draw (24.center) to (18.center);
	\end{pgfonlayer}
\end{tikzpicture}

Some questions related to rectangular billiards:

1. Given a random starting point and direction, what proportion of the total region is traversed?
  Will the trajectory entire a given region?
  How long does the billiard spend in any given region?

**Theorem:**
The percentage of time spent in a given area is equal to the proportion of its area to the total area.

> This requires some ergodic theory.

2. If you shine a laser from a given spot, is the entire region illuminated?

Theorem:
No! There is a counterexample with 18 sides.
Moreover, no positive-area region can be avoided, but certain finite sets can.

Definition:
A *flat surface* is a generalization of translation surfaces that now allows gluing by any isometry of $\RR^2$.

Example:
A cube is a flat surface, noting that there is a planar gluing diagram for it that now requires rotations of $\pi/2$ radians:

![Image](figures/2020-01-11-22:16.png)

Note that we can form higher genus surfaces using polygon gluing:
\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={fill=black,shape=circle,scale=0.5},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
	\begin{pgfonlayer}{nodelayer}
		\node[style=none] (0) at (-0.75, 2.5) {};
		\node [style=none] (1) at (0.75, 2.5) {};
		\node [style=none] (2) at (-1.75, 1.25) {};
		\node [style=none] (3) at (1.75, 1.25) {};
		\node [style=none] (4) at (-1.75, -0.25) {};
		\node [style=none] (5) at (1.75, -0.25) {};
		\node [style=none] (6) at (-0.75, -1.5) {};
		\node [style=none] (7) at (0.75, -1.5) {};
		\node [style=none] (8) at (-1.75, 1.25) {};
	\end{pgfonlayer}
	\begin{pgfonlayer}{edgelayer}
		\draw (0.center) to node [auto] {$d$}  (8.center);
		\draw (8.center) to node [auto] {$a$}  (4.center);
		\draw (4.center) to node [auto] {$b$}  (6.center);
		\draw (6.center) to node [auto] {$c$}  (7.center);
		\draw (7.center) to node [auto] {$d$}  (5.center);
		\draw (5.center) to node [auto] {$a$}  (3.center);
		\draw (3.center) to node [auto] {$b$}  (1.center);
		\draw (1.center) to node [auto] {$c$}  (0.center);
	\end{pgfonlayer}
\end{tikzpicture}

Exercise: 
Check that there is only one vertex in this polygon.

In general, the vertices may have total angle greater than $\2pi n$.
We refer to these as *cone points*, and the total angle as the *cone angle*.

Exercise:
Check that the cone angle in the above example is $6\pi$ by taking a loop around the cone point.

> Note on a weird phenomenon: it seems difficult to find $\ZZ^2$ or $\QQ^2$ points on the sloped edges of a regular polygon, based on computer drawings.

Remark:
This flat surface admits charts to $\CC$ with the following transition functions.
Let $P$ denote the single cone point.

Then there is a 3-fold cover give by the following space, thought of as a singular helical

\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={fill=black,shape=circle,scale=0.5},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
	\draw (0, 0) circle (3cm);
	\node [style=none, label=P] (0) at (0, 0) {};
	\node [style=none] (1) at (3, 0) {};
	\draw (0.center) to node [above] {$C$} node [below] {$A$} (1.center);

	\draw (0, -7) circle (3cm);
	\node [style=none, label=P] (0) at (0, -7) {};
	\node [style=none] (1) at (3, -7) {};
	\draw (0.center) to node [above] {$A$} node [below] {$B$} (1.center);

	\draw (0, -14) circle (3cm);
	\node [style=none, label=P] (0) at (0, -14) {};
	\node [style=none] (1) at (3, -14) {};
	\draw (0.center) to node [above] {$B$} node [below] {$C$} (1.center);

\end{tikzpicture}

which maps onto the unit disc in $\CC$:

\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={fill=black,shape=circle,scale=0.5},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
	\draw (0, 0) circle (3cm);

	\node [style=none, label=P] (P) at (0, 0) {};
	\node [style=none] (u1) at  ({1*360/3}: 3cm){};
	\node [style=none] (u2) at  ({2*360/3}: 3cm){};
	\node [style=none] (u3) at  ({3*360/3}: 3cm){};

	\draw (P) to (u1);
	\draw (P) to (u2);
	\draw (P) to (u3);

	\node [label=1] (u1) at  ({1*360/6}: 1.5cm){};	
	\node [label=2] (u1) at  ({3*360/6}: 1.5cm){};
	\node [label=3] (u1) at  ({5*360/6}: 1.5cm){};

\end{tikzpicture}

The covering map from the former to the latter is given by $z\mapsto z^{\frac 1 3}$, which coincides with the fact that the cone angle at $P$ is $3(2\pi)$.

One can also imagine this space in $\RR^3$ with a projection onto the plane:
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.16,width=10cm,height=14cm}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[trig format plots=rad,
		view={-40}{6*pi},
		colormap={adopted}{
			rgb255(0cm)=(219,0,70);
	    rgb255(1cm)=(55,70,170);
			rgb255(2cm)=(219,0,70)
		},
		z buffer=sort,
		zmin=0]
\addplot3 [surf,domain=0.001:4,domain y=-pi/2:6*pi-pi/2,samples=25,samples y=40]
({x*cos(y)},{x*sin(y)},{ln(x)+y});
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

In general, near the vertex $P$, the map $z\mapsto z^{\frac 1 n}$ will be a local chart for any $z$ in a neighborhood of $P$.

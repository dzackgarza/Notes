# From Class

Motivation: Gauss' Unicursal Problem.
How many distinct curves $\alpha: I \to \RR^2$ with are there with no triple crossings?

Note that if we compactify the plane to the Riemann sphere (and possibly take the curve to be piecewise linear) then we obtain a *tiling* of the sphere.
We can also take a *dual tiling* by taking the barycenters of each polygon and connecting them by an edge iff their corresponding polygons share an edge.

Definition:
A *translation surface* is the 2-dimensional topological manifold obtained by taking any set of polygons in $\RR^2$ and gluing their edges by translations.

Example:
Any elliptic curve (topologically a torus).

We take equivalence up to cutting, pasting, and rearranging.

Lemma:
Two elliptic curves (of genus 2) are isomorphic iff the translation surfaces differ by a homothety, i.e. a rotation and scaling.

> Note: we will eventually see that the data of a translation surface is equivalently a holomorphic 1-form.

Definition:
A *half-translation surface* is a translation surface where we now additionally allow gluing by rotations of $\pi$ radians.

Lemma:
Any game of *rectangular billiards* yields a translation surface.

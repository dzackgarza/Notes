title: Notes on Tilings

# From Class

Motivation: Gauss' Unicursal Problem.
How many distinct curves $\alpha: I \to \RR^2$ with are there with no triple crossings?

Note that if we compactify the plane to the Riemann sphere (and possibly take the curve to be piecewise linear) then we obtain a *tiling* of the sphere.
We can also take a *dual tiling* by taking the barycenters of each polygon and connecting them by an edge iff their corresponding polygons share an edge.

Square tiled surfaces in $\mch(k)$ with $d$ squares correspond to degree $d$ branched covers of the identification square, branched over the origin, with profile (?).

To count square-tiled surfaces: label squares, look at inverse images of $\ast$ by $\theset{1 ,\cdots, d}$.
Consider the monodromy representation $\rho: \pi_1( \TT \setminus \theset{0}, \ast ) \to S_d$ where $\sigma = \rho(\alpha) = (1)(23)$ and $\tau = \rho(\beta) = (12)(3)$.
We compute ramification orders by considering the commutators $[\alpha, \beta]$.
Then $\rho([\alpha, \beta] )$ has cycle type $(1, 1, \cdots 1, 1+k, \cdots, 1+ k_n)$.
Note that $[(23), (12)]$ is a 3 cycle.

**Conclusion:**
The number of square-tiled surfaces in $\mch(k)$ with $d$ squares is exactly $\frac{1}{d!} \abs{\sigma, \tau \in S_d \suchthat [\sigma, \tau] \in C_{1, \cdots, 1, 1+k, \cdots, 1+ k_n}}$.

Note that the division is due to the artificial labeling of squares.

Main theorem:
The generating function $f_\kappa(q)\definedas \sum_{d\geq 1} \#\theset{\text{Square tiled, $d$ squares in $\mch(k)$}} q^d$ is a modular form.
Follows from taking $q = e^{2\pi i \tau}$ which is holomorphic on $\HH$ the upper half-plane, satisfying a transformation rule with respect to $\tau \mapsto -1/\tau$, which is a finite-dimensional space.

> Actual: quasimodular mixed form.

Concretely, $f_\kappa \in \QQ[E_2, E_4, E_8]$.

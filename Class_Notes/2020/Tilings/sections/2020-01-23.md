Square tiled surfaces in $\mch(k)$ with $d$ squares correspond to degree $d$ branched covers of the identification square, branched over the origin, with profile (?).

To count square-tiled surfaces: label squares, look at inverse images of $\ast$ by $\theset{1 ,\cdots, d}$.
Consider the monodromy representation $\rho: \pi_1( \TT \setminus \theset{0}, \ast ) \to S_d$ where $\sigma = \rho(\alpha) = (1)(23)$ and $\tau = \rho(\beta) = (12)(3)$.
We compute ramification orders by considering the commutators $[\alpha, \beta]$.

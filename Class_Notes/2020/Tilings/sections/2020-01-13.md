**Holomorphic Forms:**
A holomorphic $p\dash$form on $X$ is a section of $\Lambda^p T\dual X$, the $p$th exterior power of the holomorphic cotangent bundle of $X$.

For $n = \dim_\CC X$, the $n\dash$forms are an important special case.
Any such form $w$ is given in local coordinates $(z_1, \cdots, z_n)$ by 

\begin{align*}
w = w(z_1, \cdots, z_n) dz_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dz_n
\end{align*}

for some holomorphic function $w: \CC^n \to ?$.

**Canonical Bundle:**
Given a complex manifold $M$, we can define the tangent bundle $\CC^n \to TM \to M$ and the cotangent bundle $C^n \to T\dual M \to M$, which we'll just denote $T\dual M$.
Then the canonical bundle is the bundle $\CC\to \Lambda^n T\dual M \to M?$, denoted by $\omega$, obtained by taking the $n$th exterior power.
It is a theorem that the fibers are in fact lines.
For vector bundles, this is referred to as the *determinant bundle*.
If $M$ is a smooth manifold, then $\omega$ has a global section.

> Note: a holomorphic $n\dash$form is exactly the same as a section of the canonical bundle.

Interesting aside: a Calabi-Yau is a manifold with a nowhere vanishing holomorphic $n\dash$form, which implies that the canonical bundle admits a map to a trivial line bundle that is an isomorphism, i.e. the canonical bundle is trivial.

Exercise:
For $\Sigma_g$ a compact Riemann surface of genus $g$, the space of holomorphic sections of the canonical is a vector space (over $\CC$?) of dimension $g$.

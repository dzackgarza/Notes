Today: projective spaces.
We defined $\PP^n_{/k} \da k^{n+1}\smz /\sim$ where $x\sim \lambda x$ for all $x\in k\units$, which we identified with lines through the origin in $k^{n+1}$.
We have homogeneous coordinates $p = [x_0: \cdots : x_n]$.

We say an ideal is *homogeneous* iff for all $f\in I$, the homogeneous part $f_d\in I$ for all $d$.

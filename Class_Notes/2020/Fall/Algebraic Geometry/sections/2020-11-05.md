Today: projective spaces.
We defined $\PP^n_{/k} \da k^{n+1}\smz /\sim$ where $x\sim \lambda x$ for all $x\in k\units$, which we identified with lines through the origin in $k^{n+1}$.
We have homogeneous coordinates $p = [x_0: \cdots : x_n]$.

We say an ideal is *homogeneous* iff for all $f\in I$, the homogeneous part $f_d\in I$ for all $d$.
In this case $V_p(I) \subset \PP^{n}_{/k}$ defined as the vanishing locus of all homogeneous elements of $I$ is well-defined.
Think of this as the "projective version" of a vanishing locus.

Similarly we defined $I_p(S)$ defined as the ideal generated by all homogeneous $f\in \kx{n}$ such that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x\in S$.

:::{.remark}
Observe that $V_a(I)$ defined as the cone over $V_p(I)$ is the set of points in $\AA^{n+1}\smz \union \ts{0}$ whch map to $V_p(I)$.

Today: projective spaces.
We defined $\PP^n_{/k} \da k^{n+1}\smz /\sim$ where $x\sim \lambda x$ for all $x\in k\units$, which we identified with lines through the origin in $k^{n+1}$.
We have homogeneous coordinates $p = [x_0: \cdots : x_n]$.

We say an ideal is *homogeneous* iff for all $f\in I$, the homogeneous part $f_d\in I$ for all $d$.
In this case $V_p(I) \subset \PP^{n}_{/k}$ defined as the vanishing locus of all homogeneous elements of $I$ is well-defined.
Think of this as the "projective version" of a vanishing locus.

Similarly we defined $I_p(S)$ defined as the ideal generated by all homogeneous $f\in \kx{n}$ such that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x\in S$.

:::{.remark}
Observe that $V_a(I)$ defined as the cone over $V_p(I)$ is the set of points in $\AA^{n+1}\smz \union \ts{0}$ which map to $V_p(I)$.

We have an alternative definition of a cone in $\AA^{n+1}$, characterized as a closed subset $C$ which is closed under scaling, so $kC\subseteq C$.

:::{.proposition}
\envlist

- If $S\subset \kx{n}$ is a set of homogeneous polynomials, then $V_a(S)$ is a cone since it is closed and closed under scaling.
  This follows from the fact that $f(x) = 0 \iff f(\lambda x) = 0$ for $\lambda \in k\units$ when $f$ is homogeneous.

- If $C$ is a cone, then its affine ideal $I_a(C)$ is homogeneous.

:::{.proof title="?"}
Let $f\in I_a(C)$, then $f(x) = 0$ for all $x\in C$.
Since $C$ is closed under scaling, $f(\lambda x) = 0$ for all $x\in C$ and $\lambda \in k\units$.

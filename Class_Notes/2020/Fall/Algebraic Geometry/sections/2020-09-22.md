Review: Regular functions.
Given an affine variety $X$ and $U\subseteq X$ open, a *regular function* $\phi: U\to k$ is one locally (wrt the zariski topology) a fraction.
We write the set of regular functions as $\OO_X$.

:::{.example}
$X = V(x_1 x_4 - x_2 x_3)$ on $U = V(x_2, x_4)^c$, the following function is regular:
\[  
\phi: U &\to k \\
x &\mapsto 
\begin{cases}
{x_1\over x_2} & x_2 \neq 0 \\
{x_3 \over x_4} & x_4 \neq 0
\end{cases}
.\]
Note that this is not globally a fraction.

:::{.definition title="Distinguished Open Sets"}
A *distinguished open set* $D(f) \subseteq X$ for some $f\in A(X)$ is $V(f)^c \da \ts{x\in X \st f(x) \neq 0}$.
:::

These are useful because the $D(f)$ form a base for the zariski topology.

:::{.proposition title="?"}
For $X$ an affine variety, $f\in A(X)$, we have
\[ 
\OO_X(D(f)) = \ts{ {g\over f^n} \st g\in A(X), n\in \NN}
.\]
:::

:::{.proof}
The first reduction we made was that $\phi \in \OO_X(D(f))$ is expressible as $g_a\over f_a$ on distinguished opens $D(f_a)$ covering $D(f)$.
We also noted that ${g_a \over f_a} = {g_b \over f_b}$ on $D(f_a) \intersect D(f_b)$, so $f_b g_a = f_a g_b$ in $A(X)$.

The second step was writing $D(f) = \union D(f_a_)$, and so $V(f) = \intersect_a V(f_a)$ implies that $f\in I(V(\ts{f_a \st a\in U}))$.
By the Nullstellensatz, $f\in \sqrt{\gens{f_a \st a\in U}}$, so $f^N = \sum k_a f_a$ for some $N$.

So construct $g = \sum k_a g_a$, then compute
\[  
gf_b = \sum_a k_a g_a f_b = \sum_a k_
.\]

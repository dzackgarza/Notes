## Useful Facts

:::{.proposition}
A polynomial ring $\kx{n}$ on finitely many generators is Noetherian.
In particular, every ideal $I\normal \kx{n}$ has a finite set of generators and can be written as $I = \gens{f_1, \cdots, f_m}$.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
By Hilbert's basis theorem, every polynomial ring over a Noetherian ring is again Noetherian.
A field $k$ is both Artinian and Noetherian, since it has only two ideals and thus any chain of ideals necessarily terminates.

Recall that the Zariski topology is defined on an affine variety $X = V(J)$ with $J \normal k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ by describing the closed sets.

:::{.proposition title="?"}
$X$ is irreducible if its coordinate ring $A(X)$ is a domain.
:::


:::{.proposition title="?"}
There is a 1-to-1 correspondence
\[  
\correspond{\text{Irreducible subvarieties} \\ \text{of }X}
\correspond{\text{Prime ideals} \\ \text{in }A(X)}
.\]
:::

:::{.proof}
Suppose $Y\subset X$ is an affine subvariety.
Then 
\[  
A(X) / I_X(Y) = A(Y)
.\]

By NSS, there is a bijection between subvarieties of $X$ and radical ideals of $A(X)$ where $Y\mapsto I_X(Y)$.
A quotient is a domain iff quotienting by a prime ideal, so $A(Y)$ is a domain iff $I_X(Y)$ is prime.
:::

Recall that $\mfp \normal R$ is prime when $fg\in \mfp \iff f\in \mfp$ or $g\in \mfp$.
Thus $\bar f \bar g = 0$ in $R/\mfp$ implies $\bar f = 0$ or $\bar g = 0$ in $R/\mfp$, i.e. $R/\mfp$ is a domain.

Finally note that prime ideals are radical (easy proof).

:::{.example}
Consider $\AA^2/\CC$ and some subvarieties $C_i$:

Then irreducible subvarieties correspond to prime ideals in $\CC[x, y]$.
Here $C_1, C_3$ correspond to $V(f), V(g)$ for $f,g$ irreducible polynomials, whereas $C_2$ corresponds to a maximal ideal, i.e. $V(x_1 - a_1, x_2 - a_2)$.

Note that $I(C_1 \union C_2 \union C_3)$ is not a prime ideal, since the variety is reducible as the union of 3 closed subsets.
:::

:::{.example}
A finite set is irreducible iff it contains only one point.
:::

:::{.example}
Any irreducible topological space is connected, since irreducible requires a union but connectedness requires a *disjoint* union.
:::

:::{.example}
$A^n/k$ is irreducible: by prop 2.8, its irreducible iff the coordinate ring is a domain.
However $A(\AA^n)  = k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$, which is a domain.
:::

:::{.example}
$V(x_1 x_2)$ is not irreducible, since it's equal to $V(x_1) \union V(x_2)$.
:::

:::{.definition title="Noetherian Space"}
A *Noetherian* topological space $X$ is a space with no infinite strictly decreasing sequence of closed subsets.
:::

:::{.proposition title="?"}
An affine variety $X$ with the zariski topology is a noetherian space.
:::

:::{.proof}
Let $X_0 \supseteqneq X_1 \supsetneq \cdots$ be a decreasing sequence of closed subspaces.
Then $I(X_0) \subsetneq I(X_1) \subsetneq$.
Note that these containments are strict, otherwise we could use $V(I(X_1)) = X_1$ to get an equality in the original chain.

Recall that a ring $R$ is Noetherian iff every ascending chain of ideals terminates.
Thus it suffices to show that $A(X)$ is Noetherian.

We have $A(X) = \kx{n} / I(X)$, and if this had an infinite chain $I_1 \subsetneq I_2 \subsetneq \cdots$ lifts to a chain in $\kx{n}$,

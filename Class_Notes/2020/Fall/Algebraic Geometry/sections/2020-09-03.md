Recall that the Zariski topology is defined on an affine variety $X = V(J)$ with $J \normal k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ by describing the closed sets.

:::{.proposition title="?"}
$X$ is irreducible if its coordinate ring $A(X)$ is a domain.

:::{.proposition title="?"}
There is a 1-to-1 correspondence
\[  
\correspond{\text{Irreducible subvarieties} \\ \text{of }X}
\correspond{\text{Prime ideals} \\ \text{in }A(X)}
.\]
:::

:::{.proof}
Suppose $Y\subset X$ is an affine subvariety.
Then 
\[  
A(X) / I_X(Y) = A(Y)
.\]

By NSS, there is a bijection between subvarieties of $X$ and radical ideals of $A(X)$ where $Y\mapsto I_X(Y)$.
A quotient is a domain iff quotienting by a prime ideal, so $A(Y)$ is a domain iff $I_X(Y)$ is prime.

Recall that $\mfp \normal R$ is prime when $fg\in \mfp \iff f\in \mfp$ or $g\in \mfp$.
Thus $\bar f \bar g = 0$ in $R/\mfp$ implies $\bar f = 0$ or $\bar g = 0$ in $R/\mfp$, i.e. $R/\mfp$ is a domain.

Recall Hilbert's Nullstellensatz:

a. For any affine variety, $V(I(X)) = X$.

b. For any ideal $J\normal k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$, $I(V(J)) = \sqrt{J}$.

So there's an order-reversing bijection
\[  
\correspond{\text{Radical ideals } k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]} \mapstofrom{V(\wait)}{I(\wait)}
\correspond{\text{Affine varieties in } \AA^n}
.\]


In proving $I(V(J)) \subseteq \sqrt{J}$, we had an important lemma (Noether Normalization): the maximal ideals of $\kx$ are of the form $\gens{x-a_1, \cdots, x-a_n}$.

:::{.corollary title="?"}
If $V(I)$ is empty, then $I = \gens{1}$.

> Slogan: the only ideals that vanish nowhere are trivial.
> No common vanishing locus $\implies$ trivial ideal, so there's a linear combination that equals 1.

:::{.proof}
By contrapositive, suppose $I\neq \gens{1}$.
By Zorn's Lemma, these exists a maximal ideals $\mfm$ such that $I \subset \mfm$.
By the order-reversing property of $V(\wait)$, $V(\mfm) \sub V(I)$.
By the classification of maximal ideals, $\mfm = \gens{x-a_1, x-a_2}$

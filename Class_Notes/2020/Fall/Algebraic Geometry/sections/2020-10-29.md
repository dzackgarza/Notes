## Projective Space

:::{.definition title="Projective Space"}
Let $n\in \NN$, and define **projective $n\dash$space** over $k$ by \
\[  
\PP^n/k = \ts{\text{lines through the origin in } k^{n+1}}
.\]
:::

:::{.remark}
For notation, given $L\in \PP^n/k$, it is spanned by any nonzero points $\tv{x_0, \cdots, x_n} \in L$, and $L$ is uniquely determined by this point up to scaling by elements in $k\units$. 
In this case, we write $L = \tv{x_0: \cdots : x_n}$.

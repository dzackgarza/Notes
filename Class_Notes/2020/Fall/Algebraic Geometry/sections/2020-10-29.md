## Projective Space

:::{.definition title="Projective Space"}
Let $n\in \NN$, and define **projective $n\dash$space** over $k$ by \
\[  
\PP^n/k = \ts{\text{lines through the origin in } k^{n+1}}
.\]
:::

:::{.remark}
For notation, given $L\in \PP^n/k$, it is spanned by any nonzero points $\tv{x_0, \cdots, x_n} \in L$, and $L$ is uniquely determined by this point up to scaling by elements in $k\units$. 
In this case, we write $L = \tv{x_0: \cdots : x_n} = \tv{\lambda x_0: \cdots : \lambda x_n]$.
We can then define $\PP^n/k = k^{n+1}\smz / \sim$ where we mod out by scalar multiplication.
We call $[x_1 : \cdots : x_n]$ the *homogeneous coordinates* on $\PP^n/k$.

:::{.remark}
Consider the map
\[  
\AA^n \to \PP^n \\
\tv{x_1, \cdots, x_n} &\mapsto \tv{1: x_1 : \cdots : x_n}
.\]
This is injective.
Conversely, consider
\[  
"D(x_0)" \subset \PP^n \da \ts{\tv{x_0 : \cdots : x_n} \st x_0\neq 0}
.\]
This is a well-defined subset of $\PP^n$, since it only depends on the equivalence class of a point.
In this case, there is a unique $\lambda(x_0, \cdots, x_n)$, namely $\lambda = 1/x_0$, such that each point in this set is of the form $\tv{1: {x_1\over x_0} : \cdots : {x_n \over x_0}}$, yielding a copy of $\AA^n\subset \PP^n$ given by points $\tv{{x_1\over x_0}, \cdots, {x_n\over x_0}}$.
What is its complement?

It's given by $\ts{\tv{0: x_1: \cdots : x_n}} \subset \PP^n$, which is equal (as a set) to a copy of $\PP^{n-1}$ defined by the set of lines in $k^n$ defined by $x_0 = 0$.
:::

:::{.example title="?"}
Note that $\PP^1$ contains a copy of $\AA^1$ where $x_0 \neq 0$ and a second copy where $x_1 \neq 0$, admitting maps
\[  
f_1: \AA^1 &\to \PP^1 \\
\tv{x_0: x_1} &\mapsto \tv{{x_0 \over x_1}}
.\]

and

\[  
f_2: \AA^1 &\to \PP^1 \\
\tv{x_0: x_1} &\mapsto \tv{{x_1 \over x_0}}
,\]
since every line in $\PP^1$ has either $x_0\neq 0$ or $x_1 \neq 0$.
These two copies cover $\PP^1$, and the "transition map" is inversion.
:::

:::{.remark}
More generally, there are $n+1$ inclusions $\AA^n \injects \PP^n$ given by dividing by the $j$th coordinate, and their union is the entire space.

Recall that the dimension of a ring $R$ is the length of the longest chain of prime ideals.
Similarly, for an affine variety $X$, we defined $\dim X$ to be the length of the longest chain of irreducible closed subsets.

These notions of dimension of the same when taking $R = A(X)$, i.e. $\dim \AA^n/k = n$.

:::{.proposition title="Dimensions"}
Let $k = \bar k$.

a. The dimension of $k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ is $n$.
b. All maximal chains of prime ideals have length $n$.

:::{.proof}
The case for $n=0$ is trivial, just take $P_0 = \gens{0}$.
For $n=1$, easy to see since the only prime ideals in $k[x]$ are $\gens{0}$ and $\gens{x-a}$, since any polynomial factors into linear factors.

Let $P_0 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq P_m$ be a maximal chain of prime ideals in $\kx{n}$; we then want to show that $m=n$.
Assume $P_0 = \gens{0}$

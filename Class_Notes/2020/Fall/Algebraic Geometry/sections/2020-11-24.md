## The Veronese Embedding

:::{.definition title="Veronese Embedding"}
Let $n, d > 0$ and let $f_0, \cdots, f_n$ be the monomials of degree $d$ in $\kx{n}$.
There is a morphism
\[  
\PP^n \sm V(f_0,\ codts, f_n) &\to \PP^N \\
\vector x &\mapsto [f_0(\vector x), \cdots, f_N(\vector x)]

,\]
where $N+1$ is the number of monomials, and is equal to ${n+d \choose d}$.

:::{.remark}
It is true that $V(f_0, \cdots, f_N) \neq \emptyset$, since $V(x_0^d, x_1^d, \cdots, x_n^d) = V(x_0, \cdots, x_n)$.
This will be the Veronese embedding, although we need to prove it is an embedding.
On an open set $D(x_0) \subset \PP^2$ one can define an inverse.
Suppose we hyave a coordinate $z_j = x_i^{d-1} x_j$ and $z_i = x_i^d$ on $\PP^N$.
Then we can take the point
\[  
\tv{ {z_1 \over z_i}, \cdots, {z_i \over z_i}, \cdots, {z_n \over z_i} }
.\]
This defines an inverse on $D(z_i)$.
Since the open sets $D(x_i)$ cover $\PP^N$, we have an inverse on the entire image.

:::{.remark}
This embedding converts hypersurfaces of degree $d$ into hyperplanes.
The Veronese is an isomorphism onto its image.
Consider $V(\sum_{j=1}^N a_j f_j) \subset\PP^n$, where $a_j\in k$

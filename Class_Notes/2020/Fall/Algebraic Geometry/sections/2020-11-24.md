## The Veronese Embedding

Let $n, d > 0$ and let $f_0, \cdots, f_n$ be the monomials of degree $d$ in $\kx{n}$.
Recall that we have a morphism
\[  
\PP^n \sm V(f_0,\ codts, f_n) &\to \PP^N \\
\vector x &\mapsto [f_0(\vector x), \cdots, f_N(\vector x)]

,\]
where $N+1$ is the number of monomials, and is equal to ${n+d \choose d}$.
It is true that $V(f_0, \cdots, f_N) \neq \emptyset$, since $V(x_0^d, x_1^d, \cdots, x_n^d) = V(x_0, \cdots, x_n)$.
This will be the Veronese embedding, although we need to prove it is an embedding.
On an open set $D(x_0) \subset \PP^2$ one can define an inverse:

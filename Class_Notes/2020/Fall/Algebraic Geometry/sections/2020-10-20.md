Recall that a *prevariety* is a ringed space that is locally isomorphic to an affine variety, where we recall that $(X, \OO_X)$ is *locally isomorphic* to an affine variety iff there exists an open cover $U_i \covers X$ such that $(U_i, \OO_{U_i})$.

We found one way of producing these: the gluing construction. 
Given two ringed spaces $(X_1, \OO_{X_1})$ and $(X_2, \OO_{X_2})$ and open sets $U_{12} \in X_1$ and $U_{21} \in X_2$.

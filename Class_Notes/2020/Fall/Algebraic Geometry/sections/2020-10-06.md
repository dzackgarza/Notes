Note: the sheaf of locally constant functions valued in a set $S$ is written $\underline{\mathbf S}$.

## Gathmann Chapter 4

:::{.definition title="Ringed Spaces"}
A **ringed space** is a topological space $X$ together with a sheaf $\OO_X$ of rings.
:::

:::{.example}
\hfill

1. $X$ an affine variety and $\OO_X$ its ring of regular functions.

2. $X$ a manifold over $\RR^n$ with $\OO_X$ a ring of smooth or continuous functions on $X$.

3. $X = \ts{p, q}$ with the discrete topology and $\OO_X$ given by $p\mapsto R, q\mapsto S$.

4. Let $U\subset X$ an open subset of $X$ an affine variety.
  Then declare $\OO_U$ to be $\ro{OO_X}{U}$.
:::

Recall that the restriction of a sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ to an open subset $U\subset X$ is defined by $\ro{\mathcal{F}}{U}(V) = \mathcal{F}(V)$.

:::{.example}
Let $X$ be a topological space and $p\in X$ a point.
The *skyscraper sheaf at $p$* is defined by
\[  
K_p(U) \da 
\begin{cases}
K & p\in U \\
0 & p\not\in U
\end{cases}
.\]

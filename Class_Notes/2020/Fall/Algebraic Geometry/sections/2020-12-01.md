Last time: we started discussing smoothness.

:::{.definition title="Tangent Space"}
The **tangent space** $T_p X$ of a variety $X$ at a point $p\in X$ is defined as 
\[
V\qty{\ts{f_1 \st f\in I(U_i),\, U_i \ni p = 0 \text{ affine } }}
\]
where $f_1$ denotes the degree 1 part.

:::{.remark}
We've really only defined it for affine varieties and $p=0$, but this is a local definition.
Note that this is also not a canonical definition, since it depends on the affine chart $U_i$.
:::

:::{.example title="?"}
Consider $T_0 V(xy) = V(f_1 \st f\in \gens{xy}) = V(0) = \AA^2$, since every polynomial in this ideal has degree at least 2.
Letting $X = V(xy)$, note that we could embed $X\injects \AA^3$ as $X\cong V(xy, z)$.
In this case we have $T_0 X = V(f_1 \st f\in \gens{xy, z}) = V(z) \cong \AA^2$.
So we get a vector space of a different dimension from this different affine embedding, but $\dim T_0 X$ is the same.

:::{.example title="?"}
Let $X = V_p(xy-z^2) \subset \PP^2$, which is a projective curve.
What is $T_p X$ for $p = [0:1:0]$?
Take an affine chart $\ts{y\neq 0} \intersect X$, noting that $\ts{y\neq 0} \cong \AA^2$.
We could dehomogenize the ideal $\ro{\gens{xy-z^2}}{y=1} = \gens{x-z^2}$.
Thus $X \intersect D(y) = V(x-z^2) \subset \AA^2$ and the point $[0:1:0] \in X$ gives $(0, 0)$ in this affine chart.
Then $T_p X = V(f_1 \st f\in \gens{x-z^2}) = V(x)$.
Then $f = (x-z^2)g$ implies that $f_1 = (xg)_1 = g_0 x$, the constant term of $g$ multiplied by $x$, since $z^2$ kills any degree 1 part of $g$.
So $T_p X$ is a line.

:::{.example title="?"}
Take $X$ to be the union of the coordinate axes in $\AA^3$.

Then $I(X) = \gens{xy, yz, xz}$ and $T_0 X = V(f_1 \st f\in I(X)) = V(0) = \AA^3$, since the minimal degree of any such polynomial is 2.
Note that $\dim X = 1$ but $\dim T_0 X = 3$
:::

:::{.example title="?"}
Take $Y = V(xy(x-y)) \subset \AA^2$.
Then $T_0 X = V(0) = \AA^2$:

:::{.remark}
Note that $X$ and $Y$ both consists of 3 copies of $\AA^1$ intersecting at a single point.

![Image](figures/image_2020-12-01-10-01-58.png){width=350px}

Note that $\dim T_0 X = 3$ but $\dim T_0 Y = 3$, and interestingly $X\not\cong Y$ as affine varieties.
There is a bijective morphism that is not invertible.
:::

:::{.remark}
We will prove that $\dim T_p X$ is invariant under choice of affine embedding.

:::{.example title="?"}
How to compute $T_{(1,0,0)} V(xy, yz, xz)$: first move $(1,0,0)$ to the origin, yielding $T_{(0,0,0)} V((x+1)y, yz, (x+1) z)$.
This is a different choice of affine embedding into $\AA^3$ which sends $(1,0,0) \mapsto (0,0,0)$.
Taking the vanishing locus of linear parts, it suffices to take the linear parts of the generators, which yields the $x\dash$axis $V(y, z)$, making the dimension of the tangent space 1.
:::

:::{.lemma title="?"}
Let $X \subset\AA^n$ be an affine variety and let $0 = p\in X$.
Then
\[
T_0(X)\dual \da \hom_k(T_0X, k) \cong I_X(p) / I_X(p)^2
\]
:::

:::{.remark}
Note that the hom involves an affine embedding, but the quotient of ideals does not.
We know that the category of affine varieties is equivalent to the category of reduced $k\dash$algebras, since the points of $X$ biject with the maximal ideals of the coordinate ring $A(X)$. 
$I_X(p)$ is the maximal ideal in $A(X)$ of regular functions vanishing at $p$.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
Consider the map
\[  
\phi: I_X(p) &\to T_0(X)\dual \\
\bar f &\mapsto \ro{f_1}{T_0(X)}
.\]
E.g. given $\bar x_1 - \bar x_2^2 \in A(X)$, we first lift to $x_1 - x_2^2 \in A(\AA^n)$, restrict to the linear part $x_1$, then restrict to $T_0(X)$.
Note that $I_X(p) = \gens{\bar x_1, \cdots, \bar x_n} \in k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]/I(X)$, and we need to check that this well-defined since there is ambiguity in choosing the above lift.

:::{.claim}
$\phi$ is well-defined.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
Consider two lifts $f, f'$ of $\bar f\in A(X) = k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]/I(X)$.
Then $f - f'\in I(X)$, so taking linear parts yields $f_1 - f_1'$.

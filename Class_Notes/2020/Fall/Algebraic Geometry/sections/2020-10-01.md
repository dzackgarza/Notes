Recall that a sheaf of rings on a topological space $X$ is a ring $\mathcal{F}(U)$ for all open sets $U\subset X$ satisfying four properties:

1. The empty set is mapped to zeor.

2. The morphism $\mathcal{F}(U)\to \mathcal{F}(U)$ is the identity.

3. Given $W\subset V\subset U$ we have
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\mathcal{F}(U) \ar[r] & & \mathcal{F}(V) \\
& \mathcal{F}(W) &
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

4. Gluing: given sections $s_i \in\mathcal{F}(U_i)$ which agree on overlaps (restrict to the same function on $U_i\intersect U_j$), there is a unique $s\in \mathcal{F}(\union U_i)$.

:::{.example}
If $X$ is an affine variety with the zariski topology, $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a sheaf of regular functions, where we recall $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ are the functions $\phi: U\to k$ that are locally a fraction.
:::

Recall that the *stalk* of a sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ at a point $p\in X$, is defined as 
\[  
\mathcal{F}_p \da \ts{(U, \phi) \st p\in U \text{ open },\, \phi \in \mathcal{F}(U)}/\sim
.\]
where $(U, \phi) \sim (U', \phi')$ if there exists a $p\in W \subset U\intersect U'$ such $\phi, \phi'$ restricted to $W$ are equal.

Recall that a *local ring* is a ring with a unique maximal ideal $\mfm$.
Given a prime ideal $\mfp \in R$, so $ab\in \mfp \implies a,b\in \mfp$, the complement $R\setminus P$ is closed under multiplication.
So we can localize to obtain $R_\mfp = \ts{a/s \st s\in R\setminus P, a\in R}/\sim$ where $a'/s' \sim a/s$ iff there exists a $t\in R\sm P$ such that $t(a's - as') = 0$.

:::{.warning}
Note that $R_f$ is localizing at the powers of $f$, whereas $R_\mfp$ is localizing at the *complement* of $\mfp$.
:::

Since maximal ideals are prime, we can localize any ring $R$ at a maximal ideal $R_\mfm$, and this will be a local ring.
Why?
The ideals in $R_\mfm$ biject with ideals in $R$ contained in $\mfm$.
Thus all ideals in $R_\mfm$ are contained in the maximal ideal generated by $\mfm$, i.e. $\mfm R_\mfm$.

:::{.lemma title="?"}
Let $X$ be an affine variety.
The stalk of the sheaf of regular functions $\OO_{X, p} \da (\OO_X)_p$ is isomorphic to the localization $A(X)_{\mfm_p}$ where $\mfm_p \da I(\ts{p})$.
:::

:::{.proof}
We can write
\[  
A(X)_{\mfm_p} \da \ts{{g\over f} \st g\in A(X),\, f\in A(X)\sm \mfm_p} / \sim
.\]
where the $f$ are regular functions on $X$ such that $f(p) = 0$.
We then have
\[  
g_1/f_1 \sim g_2/f_2 \iff \exists h(p) \neq 0 \text{ where }0 = h(f_2 g_1 - f_1 g_2)$.
.\]

We can also write
\[  
\OO_{X, p} \da \ts{(U, \phi) \st p\in U,\, \phi \in \OO_X(U) } /\sim \text{ where } (U, \phi) \sim (U', \phi') \iff \exists p\in W \subset U\intersect U' \text{ s.t. } \ro{\phi}{W} = \ro{\phi'}{W}
.\]

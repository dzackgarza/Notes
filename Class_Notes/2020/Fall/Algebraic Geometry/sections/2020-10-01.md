Recall that a sheaf of rings on a topological space $X$ is a ring $\mathcal{F}(U)$ for all open sets $U\subset X$ satisfying four properties:

1. The empty set is mapped to zeor.

2. The morphism $\mathcal{F}(U)\to \mathcal{F}(U)$ is the identity.

3. Given $W\subset V\subset U$ we have
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\mathcal{F}(U) \ar[r] & & \mathcal{F}(V) \\
& \mathcal{F}(W) &
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

4. Gluing: given sections $s_i \in\mathcal{F}(U_i)$ which agree on overlaps (restrict to the same function on $U_i\intersect U_j$), there is a unique $s\in \mathcal{F}(\union U_i)$.

:::{.example}
If $X$ is an affine variety with the zariski topology, $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a sheaf of regular functions, where we recall $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ are the functions $\phi: U\to k$ that are locally a fraction.

Recall that the *stalk* of a sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ at a point $p\in X$, is defined as 
\[  
\mathcal{F}_p \da \ts{(U, \phi) \st p\in U \text{ open },\, \phi \in \mathcal{F}(U)}/\sim
.\]
where $(U, \phi) \sim (U', \phi')$ if there exists a $p\in W \subset U\intersect U'$ such $\phi, \phi'$ restricted to $W$ are equal.

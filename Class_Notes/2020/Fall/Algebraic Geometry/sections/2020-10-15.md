## End of Chapter 4

Recall the proposition: morphisms between affine varieties are in bijection with $k\dash$algebra morphisms between their coordinate rings.
As a result, we'll redefine an affine variety to be a ringed space isomorphic to an affine variety.

This allows you to say that affine varieties embedded in different ways are the same.

:::{.example}
$\AA^2$ vs $V(x) \subset  \AA^n$.
In fact, the map
\[  
f: \AA^2 &\to \AA^3
(y,z) &\mapsto (0, y, z)
.\]
This is continuous and the pullback of regular functions are again regular.
:::

:::{.remark}
With the new definition, there is a bijection between affine varieties up to isomorphisms and finitely generated $k\dash$algebras up to algebra isomorphism.
:::

:::{.proposition title="?"}
Let $D(f) \subset X$ be a distinguished open, then $D(f)$ is a ringed space since $(X, \OO_X)$ is and we can restrict the structure sheaf.
:::

:::{.proof}
Set
\[  
Y \da \ts{(x, t) \in X\cross \AA^1 \st tf(x) = 1} \subset X\cross \AA^1
.\]
This is an affine variety, since $Y = V(I + \gens{ft-1})$.
This is isomorphic to $D(f)$ by the map
\[  
Y &\to D(f)
(x, t) &\mapsto x
.\]
with inverse $x \mapsto (x, {1\over f(x)})$.

Note that $\pi: X\cross \AA^1 \to X$ is regular, using prop 3.8: if the coordinates of a map are regular functions, then the entire map is a morphism of ringed spaces.
We can then note that $1\over f(x)$ is regular on $D(f)$, since $f\neq 0$ there.
:::

:::{.example}
$\AA^2 \smz$ is not an affine variety.
Note that this is also not a distinguished open.

We showed on a HW problem that the regular functions on $\AA^2\smz$ are $k[x, y]$, which are also the regular functions on $\AA^2$.
So there is a map inducing a pullback
\[  
\iota: \AA^2\smz &\to \AA^2 \\
\iota^* k[x, y] \mapsvia{\sim} k[x, y]
.\]
Note that $\iota^*$ is an isomorphism on the space of regular functions, but $\iota$ itself is not an isomorphism of topological spaces.
Why? $i^{-1}$ is not defined at zero.

## Chapter 5

:::{.definition title="Prevariety"}
A *prevariety* is a ringed spaced $X$ with a finite open cover by affine varieties.
This is a topological space $X$ with an open cover $\ts{U_i}_{i=1}^n \covers X$ such that $(U_i, \ro{\OO_X}{U_i} )$ is isomorphic to an affine variety.
We'll call $\OO_X$ the sheaf of *regular functions* and $U_i\subset X$ *affine open sets*.
:::

One way to construct prevarieties from affine varieties is by *gluing*:
let $X_1, X_2$ be prevarieties which are themselves actual varieties.
Let $U_{12} \subset X_1, U_{21} \subset X_2

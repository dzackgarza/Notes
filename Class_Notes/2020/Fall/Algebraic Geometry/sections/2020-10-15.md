Recall the proposition: morphisms between affine varieties are in bijection with $k\dash$algebra morphisms between their coordinate rings.
As a result, we'll redefine an affine variety to be a ringed space isomorphic to an affine variety.

This allows you to say that affine varieties embedded in different ways are the same.

:::{.example}
$\AA^2$ vs $V(x) \subset  \AA^n$.
In fact, the map
\[  
f: \AA^2 &\to \AA^3
(y,z) &\mapsto (0, y, z)
.\]
This is continuous and the pullback of regular functions are again regular.

:::{.remark}
With the new definition, there is a bijection between affine varieties up to isomorphisms and finitely generated $k\dash$algebras up to algebra isomorphism.

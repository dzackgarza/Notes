Recall the proposition: morphisms between affine varieties are in bijection with $k\dash$algebra morphisms between their coordinate rings.
As a result, we'll redefine an affine variety to be a ringed space isomorphic to an affine variety.

This allows you to say that affine varieties embedded in different ways are the same.

:::{.example}
$\AA^2$ vs $V(x) \subset  \AA^n$.

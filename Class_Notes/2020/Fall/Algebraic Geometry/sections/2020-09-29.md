Recall the definition of a presheaf: a sheaf of rings on a space is a contravariant functor from its category of open sets to ring, such that

1. $F(\emptyset) = 0$
2. The restriction from $U$ to itself is the identity,
3. Restrictions compose.

Examples:

- Smooth functions on $\RR^n$
- Holomorphic functions on $\CC$

Recall the definition of sheaf: a presheaf satisfying *unique* gluing: given $f_i \in \mathcal{F}(U_i)$, such that $\restrictionof{f_i}{U_i \intersect U_j} = \restrictionof{f_j}{U_i\intersect U_j}$ implies that there exists a unique $f\in \mathcal{F}(\union U_i)$ such that $\restrictionof{f}{U_i} = f_i$.

Question:
Are the constant functions on $\RR$ a presheaf and/or a sheaf?

Answer:
This is a presheaf but not a sheaf.
Set $\mathcal{F}(U) = \ts{f: U\to \RR \st f(x) = c} \cong \RR$ with $\mathcal{F}(\emptyset) = 0$.
Can check that restrictions of constant functions are constant, the composition of restrictions is the overall restriction, and restriction from $U$ to itself gives the function back.

Given constant functions $f_i \in \mathcal{F}(U_i)$, does there exist a unique constant function $\mathcal{F}(\union U_i)$ restricting to them?
No: take $f_1 = 1$ on $(0, 1)$ and $f_2 = 2$ on $(2, 3)$.
Can check that they both restrict to the zero function on the intersection, since these sets are disjoint.

How can we make this into a sheaf?
One way: weaken the topology.
Another way: define another presheaf $\mathcal{G}$ on $\RR$ given by *locally* constant function, i.e. $\ts{f: U\to \RR \st \forall p\in U, \exists U_p\ni p,\, \ro{f}{U_p} \text{ is constant}}$.
Reminiscent of definition of regular functions in terms of local properties.

Recall the definition of a presheaf: a sheaf of rings on a space is a contravariant functor from its category of open sets to ring, such that

1. $F(\emptyset) = 0$
2. The restriction from $U$ to itself is the identity,
3. Restrictions compose

Examples:

- Smooth functions on $\RR^n$
- Holomorphic functions on $\CC$

Recall the definition of sheaf: a presheaf satisfying *unique* gluing: given $f_i \in \mathcal{F}(U_i)$, such that $\restrictionof{f_i}{U_i \intersect U_j} = \restrictionof{f_j}{U_i\intersect U_j}$ implies that there exists a unique $f\in \mathcal{F}(\union U_i)$ such that $\restrictionof{f}{U_i} = f_i$.

Let $\ch(k)  p > 0$ and let $G$ be an algebraic group scheme.
We have a frobenius map  $F:G\to G$ given by $F((x_{ij})) = (x_{ij}^p)$, which we can iterate to get $F^r$ for $r\in \NN$.
Setting $G_r = \ker F^r$ the $r$th frobenius kernel, we get a normal series
\[  
G_1 \normal G_2 \normal \cdots \normal G
.\]

There is an associated chain of hopf algebras
\[  
\Dist(G_1) \leq \Dist(G_2) \leq \cdots \leq \Dist(G)
.\]

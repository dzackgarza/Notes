## Regular Functions

> See chapter 3 in the notes.

Some examples:

- $X$ a manifold or an open set in $\RR^n$ has a ring of $C^\infty$ functions.
- $X \subset \CC$ has a ring of holomorphic functions.
- $X\subset \RR$ has a ring of real analytic functions


These all share a common feature: it suffices to check if a function is a member on an arbitrary open set about a point, i.e. they are *local*.

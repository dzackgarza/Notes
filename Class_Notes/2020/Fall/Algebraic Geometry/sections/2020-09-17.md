## Regular Functions

> See chapter 3 in the notes.

Some examples:

- $X$ a manifold or an open set in $\RR^n$ has a ring of $C^\infty$ functions.
- $X \subset \CC$ has a ring of holomorphic functions.
- $X\subset \RR$ has a ring of real analytic functions


These all share a common feature: it suffices to check if a function is a member on an arbitrary open set about a point, i.e. they are *local*.

:::{.definition title="?"}
Let $X$ be an affine variety and $U\subseteq X$ open.
A **regular function** on $U$ is a function $\phi: U\to k$ such that $\phi$ is "locally a fraction", i.e. a ratio of polynomial functions.

More formally, for all $p\in U$ there exists a $U_p$ with $p\in U_p \subseteq U$ such that $\phi(x) = g(x)/ f(x)$ for all $x\in U_p$ with $f, g\in A(X)$.

:::{.example}
For $X$ an affine variety and $f\in A(X)$, consider the open set $U\da V(f)^c$.
Then ${1\over f}$ is a regular function on $U$, so for $p\in U$ we can take $U_p$ to be all of $U$.
:::

:::{.example}
For $X = \AA^1$, take $f=x-1$.
Then ${x\over x-1}$ is a regular function on $\AA^1 \sm\ts{1}$.
:::

:::{.example}
Let $X + V(x_1 x_4 - x_2 x_3)$ and $U \da X\sm V(x_2, x_4) = \ts{\thevector{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4} \st x_1 x_4 = x_2 x_3, x_2\neq 0 \text{ or } x_4\neq 0 }$.
Define
\[  
\phi: U &\to K \\
\thevector{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4} &\mapsto
\begin{cases}
{x_1\over x_2} & \text{if } x_2 \neq 0
{x_3\over x_4} & \text{if } x_4 \neq 0
\end{cases}
.\]

This is well-defined on $\ts{x_2\neq 0} \intersect \ts{x_4 \neq 0}$, since ${x_1\over x_2} = {x_3 \over x_4}$.
Note that this doesn't define an element of $k$ at $\thevector{0,0,0,1}\in U$.
So this is not globally a fraction.

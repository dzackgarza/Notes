Review: we discussed irreducible components.
Recall that the *Zariski topology* on an affine variety $X$ has affine subvarieties as closed sets, and a *noetherian* space has no infinitely decreasing chains of closed subspaces.

We showed that any noetherian space has a decomposition into irreducible components $X = \union X_i$ with $X_i$ closed, irreducible, and unique such that no two are subsets of each other.
Applying this to affine varieties, a descending chain of subspaces $X_0 \supsetneq X_1 \cdots$ in $X$ corresponds to an increasing chain of ideals $I(X_0) \subsetneq I(X_1) \cdots$ in $A(X)$.
Since $\kx{n}$ is a noetherian ring, this chain terminates, so affine varieties are noetherian.

## Dimension

:::{.definition title="Dimenions"}
Let $X$ be a topological space.

1. The *dimension* $\dim X \in \NN\union\ts{\infty}$ is either $\infty$ or the length $n$ of the longest chain of **irreducible** closed subsets $\emptyset \neq Y_0 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq Y_n \subset X$ where $Y_n$ need not be equal to $X$.

2. The *codimension* of $Y$ in $X$, $\codim_Y(X)$

Review: we discussed irreducible components.
Recall that the *Zariski topology* on an affine variety $X$ has affine subvarieties as closed sets, and a *noetherian* space has no infinitely decreasing chains of closed subspaces.

We showed that any noetherian space has a decomposition into irreducible components $X = \union X_i$ with $X_i$ closed, irreducible, and unique such that no two are subsets of each other.
Applying this to affine varieties, a descending chain of subspaces $X_0 \supsetneq X_1 \cdots$ in $X$ corresponds to an increasing chain of ideals $I(X_0) \subsetneq I(X_1) \cdots$ in $A(X)$.
Since $\kx{n}$ is a noetherian ring, this chain terminates, so affine varieties are noetherian.

## Dimension

:::{.definition title="Dimensions"}
Let $X$ be a topological space.

1. The *dimension* $\dim X \in \NN\union\ts{\infty}$ is either $\infty$ or the length $n$ of the longest chain of **irreducible** closed subsets $\emptyset \neq Y_0 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq Y_n \subset X$ where $Y_n$ need not be equal to $X$.

2. The *codimension* of $Y$ in $X$, $\codim_X(Y)$, for an irreducible subset $Y\subseteq X$ is the length of the longest chain $Y\subset Y_0 \subsetneq Y_1 \cdots \subset X$.

:::{.example}
Consider $\AA^1/k$, what are the closed subsets?
The finite sets, the empty set, and the entire space.

What are the irreducible closed subsets? 
Every point is a closed subset, so sets with more than one point are reducible.
So the only irreducible closed subsets are $\ts{a}, \AA^1/k$, since an affine variety is irreducible iff its coordinate ring is a domain and $A(\AA^1/k) = k[x]$.
We can check
\[  
\emptyset \subseteq Y_0 = \ts{a} \subseteq Y_1 = \AA^1/k
,\]

which is of length $1$, so $\dim(\AA^1/k) = 1$.

> Note that we count the number of nontrivial strict subset containments in this chain.

Consider $V(x_1 x_2) \subset \AA^2/k$, the union of the $x_i$ axes.
Then the closed subsets are $V(x_1), V(x_2)$, along with finite sets and their unions.
What is the longest chain of irreducible closed subsets?

Note that $k[x_1, x_2] / \gens{x_1} \cong k[x_2]$ is a domain, so $V(x_i)$ are irreducible.
So we can have a chain
\[  
\emptyset \subsetneq \ts{a} \subsetneq V(x_1) \subset X
,\]
where $a$ is any point on the $x_2\dash$axis, so $\dim(X) = 1$.

The only closed sets containing $V(x_1)$ are $V(x_1)\union S$ for $S$ some finite set, which can not be irreducible.

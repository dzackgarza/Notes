Last time: projective varieties $V(f_i) \subset \PP^n_{/k}$ with $f_i$ homogeneous.
We proved the projective nullstellensatz: for any projective variety $X$, we have $V_p(I_p(X))$ and for any homogeneous ideal $I$ with $\sqrt{I} \neq I_0$ the irrelevant ideal, $I_p(V_p(I)) = \sqrt{I}$.
Recall that $I_0 = \gens{x_0, \cdots, x_n}$.
We had a notion of a projective coordinate ring, $S(X) \da \kx{n} / I_p(X)$, which is a graded ring since $I_p(X)$ is a homogeneous ideal.

Note that $S(X)$ is not a ring of functions on $X$: e.g. for $X= \PP^n$, $S(X) = \kx{n}$ but $x_0$ is not a function on $\PP^n$.
This is because $f\qty{\tv{x_0: \cdots : x_n}} = f\qty{\tv{\lambda x_0: \cdots : \lambda x_n}}$ but $x_0\neq \lambda x_0$.
It still makes sense to ask if $f$ is zero, so $V_p(f)$ is a well-defined object.

:::{.definition title="Dehomogenization"}
Let $f\in \kx{n}$ be a homogeneous polynomial, then we define its dehomogenization as
\[  
f^i \da f(1, x_1, \cdots, x_n) \in k[x_1,\cdots, x_n]
.\]

For a homogeneous ideal, we define
\[  
J^i \da \ts{f^i \st f\in J}
.\]

:::{.example}
This is usually not homogeneous. 
Take
\[  
f &= x_0^3 + x_0 x_1^2 + x_0 x_1 x_2 + x_0^2 + x_1 \\
\implies f' &= 1  +x_1^2 + x_1 x_2 + x_1
,\]
where has terms of mixed degrees.

:::{.remark}
\envlist

- $(fg)^i = f^i g^i$,
- $(f+g)^i = f^i + g^i$

In other words, evaluating at $x_0 = 1$ is a ring morphism.

:::{.definition title="Homogenization"}
Let $f\in \kx{n}$, then the **homogenization** of $f$ is defined by
\[  
f^h \da x_0^d f({x_1 \over x_0}, \cdots, {x_n \over x_0} )
\]
where $d\da \deg(f)$.

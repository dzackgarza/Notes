Last time: projective varieties $V(f_i) \subset \PP^n_{/k}$ with $f_i$ homogeneous.
We proved the projective nullstellensatz: for any projective variety $X$, we have $V_p(I_p(X))$ and for any homogeneous ideal $I$ with $\sqrt{I} \neq I_0$ the irrelevant ideal, $I_p(V_p(I)) = \sqrt{I}$.
Recall that $I_0 = \gens{x_0, \cdots, x_n}$.
We had a notion of a projective coordinate ring, $S(X) \da \kx{n} / I_p(X)$, which is a graded ring since $I_p(X)$ is a homogeneous ideal.


Note that $S(X)$ is not a ring of functions on $X$: e.g. for $X= \PP^n$, $S(X) = \kx{n}$ but $x_0$ is not a function on $\PP^n$.
This is because $\tv{x_0: }

:::{.exercise title="1.19"}
Prove that every affine variety $X\subset \AA^n/k$ consisting of only finitely many points can be written as the zero locus of $n$ polynomials.

> Hint: Use interpolation. 
  It is useful to assume at first that all points in $X$ have different $x_1\dash$coordinates.

Determine $\sqrt{I}$ for 
\[  
I\da \gens{x_1^3 - x_2^6,\, x_1 x_2 - x_2^3} \normal \CC[x_1, x_2]
.\]

:::{.solution}
For notational purposes, let $\mathcal{I}, \mathcal{V}$ denote the maps in Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, we then have 
$$(\mathcal{I} \circ \mathcal{V})(I) = \sqrt{I}.$$

So we consider $\mathcal{V}(I)$

Let $X\subset \AA^3/k$ be the union of the three coordinate axes.
Compute generators for the ideal $I(X)$ and show that it can not be generated by fewer than 3 elements.

:::{.exercise title="1.23: Relative Nullstellensatz"}
Let $Y\subset \AA^n/k$ be an affine variety and define $A(Y)$ by the quotient 
\[  
\pi: k[x_1,\cdots, x_n] \to A(Y) \da k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]/I(Y)
.\]

a. Show that $V_Y(J) = V(\pi^{-1}(J)$ for every $J\normal A(Y)$.

b. Show that $\pi^{-1} (I_Y(X)) = I(X)$ for every affine subvariety $X\subseteq Y$.

c. Using the fact that $I(V(J)) \subset \sqrt{J}$ for every $J\normal k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$, deduce that $I_Y(V_Y(J)) \subset \sqrt{J}$ for every $J\normal A(Y)$.

  Conclude that there is an inclusion-reversing bijection
  \[  
  \correspond{\text{Affine subvarieties}\\ \text{of } Y} \iff \correspond{\text{Radical ideals} \\ \text{in } A(Y)}
  .\]

:::{.exercise title="Extra"}
Let $J \normal k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ be an ideal, and find a counterexample to $I(V(J)) =\sqrt{J}$ when $k$ is not algebraically closed.

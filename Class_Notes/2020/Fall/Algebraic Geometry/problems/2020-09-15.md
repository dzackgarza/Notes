:::{.exercise title="Gathmann 2.17"}
Find the irreducible components of 
\[  
X = V(x - yz, xz - y^2) \subset \AA^3/\CC
.\]
:::

:::{.solution}
Since $x=yz$ for all points in $X$, we have
\[  
X &= V(x-yz, yz^2 - y^2) \\
&= V\qty{x-yz, y(z^2 - y) } \\
&= V(x-yz, y) \union V(x-yz, z^2-y) \\
&\da X_1 \union X_2
.\]

:::{.claim}
These two subvarieties are irreducible.
:::

It suffices to show that the $A(X_i)$ are integral domains.
We have
\[  
A(X_1) \da \CC[x,y,z] / \gens{x-yz, y} \cong \CC[y,z]/\gens{y} \cong \CC[z]
,\]
which is an integral domain since $\CC$ is a field and thus an integral domain, and
\[  
A(X_2) \da \CC[x,y,z]/\gens{x-yz, z^2 - y} \cong \CC[y,z]/\gens{z^2-y} \cong \CC[y]
,\]
which is an integral domain for the same reason.

:::{.exercise title="Gathmann 2.18"}
Let $X\subset \AA^n$ be an arbitrary subset and show that 
\[  
V(I(X)) = \bar{X}
.\]

:::

:::{.solution}
\hfill

$\bar X \subseteq V(I(X))$:
\
We have $X\subseteq V(I(X))$ and since $V(J)$ is closed in the Zariski topology for any ideal $J \normal \kx{n}$ by definition, $V(I(X))$ is closed.
Thus 
\[  
X\subseteq V(I(X)) \text{ and } V(I(X))\text{ closed } \implies \bar X \subseteq V(I(X))
,\]
since $\bar X$ is the intersection of all closed sets containing $X$.
\

$V(I(X)) \subseteq \bar X$:
\
Noting that $V(\wait), I(\wait)$ are individually order-reversing, we find that $V(I(\wait))$ is order-*preserving* and thus
\[  
X\subseteq \bar X \implies V(I(X)) \subseteq V(I(\bar X)) = \bar X
,\]
where in the last equality we've used part (i) of the Nullstellensatz: if $X$ is an affine variety, then $V(I(X)) = X$.
This applies here because $\bar X$ is always closed, and the closed sets in the Zariski topology are precisely the affine varieties.

:::{.exercise title="Gathmann 2.21"}
Let $\ts{U_i}_{i\in I} \covers X$ be an open cover of a topological space with $U_i \intersect U_j \neq \emptyset$ for every $i, j$.

a. Show that if $U_i$ is connected for every $i$ then $X$ is connected.

b. Show that if $U_i$ is irreducible for every $i$ then $X$ is irreducible.
:::

:::{.solution title="a"}
Suppose toward a contradiction that $X = X_1 \disjoint X_2$ with $X_i$ proper, disjoint, open, and nonempty.
Since $\ts{U_i} \covers X$, for each $j\in I$ this would force one of $U_j \subseteq X_1$ or $U_j \subseteq X_2$, since otherwise $U_j \intersect X_1 \intersect X_2$ would be nonempty.
\
So without loss of generality (relabeling if necessary), assume $U_j \in X_1$ for some fixed $j$.
But then for every $i\neq j$, we have $U_i \intersect U_j$ nonempty by assumption, and so in fact $U_i \subseteq X_1$ for every $i\in I$.
But then $\union_{i\in I}U_i \subseteq X_1$

:::{.solution title="b"}
:::{.claim}
$X$ is irreducible iff any two open subsets intersect.
:::
This follows because otherwise, if $U, V \subset X$ are open and disjoint then $X\sm U,\, X\sm V$ are proper and closed.
But then we can write $X = \qty{X\sm U} \disjoint \qty{X\sm V}$ as a union of proper closed subsets, forcing $X$ to not be irreducible.
\

So it suffices to show that if $U, V\subset X$ then $U\intersect V$ is nonempty.
Since $\ts{U_i} \covers X$, we can find a pair $i, j$ such that there is at least one point in $U\intersect U_i$ and one point in $V \intersect U_j$.
\

But by assumption $U_i\intersect U_j$ is nonempty, so both $U\intersect U_i$ and $U_j \intersect U_i$ are open nonempty subsets of $U_i$.
Since $U_i$ was assumed irreducible, they must intersect, so there exists a point
\[  
x_0 \in \qty{U\intersect U_i} \intersect \qty{U_j \intersect U_i} = U\intersect \qty{U_i \intersect U_j} \da \tilde U
.\]

We can now similarly note that $\tilde U \intersect V$ and $U_j \intersect V$ are nonempty open subsets of $V$, and thus intersect.
So there is a point
\[  
\tilde x_0 \in \qty{\tilde U \intersect V} \intersect \qty{U_j \intersect V} = \tilde U\intersect V = U\intersect V \intersect \qty{U_i \intersect U_j}
,\]
and in particular $\tilde x_0 \in U\intersect V$ as desired.

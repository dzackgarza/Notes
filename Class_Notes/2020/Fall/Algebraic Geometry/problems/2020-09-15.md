:::{.exercise title="Gathmann 2.17"}
Find the irreducible components of 
\[  
X = V(x - yz, xz - y^2) \subset \AA^3/\CC
.\]
:::

:::{.solution}
Since $x=yz$ for all points in $X$, we have
\[  
X &= V(x-yz, yz^2 - y^2) \\
&= V\qty{x-yz, y(z^2 - y) } \\
&= V(x-yz, y) \union V(x-yz, z^2-y) \\
&\da X_1 \union X_2
.\]

:::{.claim}
These two subvarieties are irreducible.
:::

It suffices to show that the $A(X_i)$ are integral domains.
We have
\[  
A(X_1) \da \CC[x,y,z] / \gens{x-yz, y} \cong \CC[y,z]/\gens{y} \cong \CC[z]
,\]
which is an integral domain since $\CC$ is a field and thus an integral domain, and
\[  
A(X_2) \da \CC[x,y,z]/\gens{x-yz, z^2 - y} \cong \CC[y,z]/\gens{z^2-y} \cong \CC[y]
,\]
which is an integral domain for the same reason.

:::{.exercise title="Gathmann 2.18"}
Let $X\subset \AA^n$ be an arbitrary subset and show that 
\[  
V(I(X)) = \bar{X}
.\]

:::

:::{.solution}
\hfill

$\bar X \subseteq V(I(X))$:
\
We have $X\subseteq V(I(X))$ and since $V(J)$ is closed in the Zariski topology for any ideal $J \normal \kx{n}$ by definition, $V(I(X))$ is closed.
Thus 
\[  
X\subseteq V(I(X)) \text{ and } V(I(X))\text{ closed } \implies \bar X \subseteq V(I(X))
,\]
since $\bar X$ is the intersection of all closed sets containing $X$.
\

$V(I(X)) \subseteq \bar X$:
\
Noting that $V(\wait), I(\wait)$ are individually order-reversing, we find that $V(I(\wait))$ is order-*preserving* and thus
\[  
X\subseteq \bar X \implies V(I(X)) \subseteq V(I(\bar X)) = \bar X
,\]
where in the last equality we've used part (i) of the Nullstellensatz: if $X$ is an affine variety, then $V(I(X)) = X$.
This applies here because $\bar X$ is always closed, and the closed sets in the Zariski topology are precisely the affine varieties.

Last time: $V(I) = \ts{x\in \AA^n \st f(x) = 0 \, \forall x\in I}$ and $I(X) = \ts{f\in k[x_1, \cdots, x_n] \st f(x) = 0\, \forall x\in X}$.
We proved the Hilbert Nullstellensatz $I(V(J)) = \sqrt{J}$, defined the coordinate ring of an affine variety $X$ as $A(X) \da k[x_1, \cdots, x_n] / I(X)$, the ring of "regular" (polynomial) functions on $X$.

Recall that a *topology* on $X$ can be defined as a collection of "closed" subsets of $X$ that are closed under arbitrary intersections and finite unions.

Let $X$ be the set of all $2\times 3$ matrices over $k$ that have rank at most 1, considered as a subset of $\AA^6 = \Mat(2\times 3, k)$.
Show that $X$ is an irreducible variety, and find its dimension.

Let $X$ be a topological space, and show

a. If $\ts{U_i} \covers X$, then $\dim X = \sup_{i\in I} \dim U_i$.

b. If $X$ is an irreducible affine variety and $U\subset X$ is a nonempty subset, then $\dim X = \dim U$.

Consider a set $U$ in the complement of $(0, 0) \in \AA^2$.
Prove that any regular function on $U$ extends to a regular function on all of $\AA^2$.

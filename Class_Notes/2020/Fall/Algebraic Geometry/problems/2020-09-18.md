Let $X$ be the set of all $2\times 3$ matrices over $k$ that have rank at most 1, considered as a subset of $\AA^6 = \Mat(2\times 3, k)$.
Show that $X$ is an irreducible variety, and find its dimension.

:::{.exercise title="Gathmann 2.34"}
Let $X$ be a topological space, and show

a. If $\ts{U_i} \covers X$, then $\dim X = \sup_{i\in I} \dim U_i$.

b. If $X$ is an irreducible affine variety and $U\subset X$ is a nonempty subset, then $\dim X = \dim U$.
  Does this hold for any irreducible topological space?

Prove the following:

a. Every noetherian topological space is compact.
  In particular, every open subset of an affine variety is compact in the Zariski topology.

b. A complex affine variety of dimension at least 1 is never compact in the classical topology.

Define
\[  
X \da \ts{M \in \mat(2\times 3, k) \st \rk M \leq 1} \subseteq \AA^6/k
.\]

Show that $X$ is an irreducible variety, and find its dimension.

:::{.exercise title="Gathmann 2.34"}
Let $X$ be a topological space, and show

a. If $\ts{U_i} \covers X$, then $\dim X = \sup_{i\in I} \dim U_i$.

b. If $X$ is an irreducible affine variety and $U\subset X$ is a nonempty subset, then $\dim X = \dim U$.
  Does this hold for any irreducible topological space?

:::{.exercise title="Gathmann 2.36"}
Prove the following:

a. Every noetherian topological space is compact.
  In particular, every open subset of an affine variety is compact in the Zariski topology.

b. A complex affine variety of dimension at least 1 is never compact in the classical topology.

:::{.exercise title="Gathmann 2.40"}
Let
\[  
R = k[x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4] / \gens{x_1 x_4 - x_2 x_3} 
\]
and show the following:

a. $R$ is an integral domain of dimension 3.

b. $x_1, \cdots, x_4$ are irreducible but not prime in $R$, and thus $R$ is not a UFD.

c. $x_1 x_4$ and $x_2 x_3$ are two decompositions of the same element in $R$ which are nonassociate.

d. $\gens{x_1, x_2}$ is a prime ideal of codimension 1 in $R$ that is not principal.

:::{.exercise title="Problem 5"}
Consider a set $U$ in the complement of $(0, 0) \in \AA^2$.
Prove that any regular function on $U$ extends to a regular function on all of $\AA^2$.

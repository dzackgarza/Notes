Chapter 10: From Floer to Morse

Goal:
Let $H$ be a nondegenerate autonomous Hamiltonian (so not time-dependent) which is sufficiently small in the $C^2$ topology.
We want to show that $CF_* \cong CM_*$

- To be precise with notation, define
  - $CM_*(H, J)$ will be the morse complex associated with a Morse function $H$, its vector field $\nabla H$
  - $CF_*(H, J)$

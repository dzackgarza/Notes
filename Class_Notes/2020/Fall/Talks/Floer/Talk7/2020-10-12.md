Chapter 10: From Floer to Morse

- To be precise with notation, define
  - $CM_*(H, J)$ will be the morse complex associated with a Morse function $H$, its vector field $\nabla H$ the gradient for the metric defined by $J, \omega$.
  - $CF_*(H, J)$

:::{.theorem title="Main Goal"}
There exists a nondegenerate Hamiltonian that is sufficiently small in the $C^2$ topology for which both the Floer and Morse complexes are well-defined, and 
\[  
CF_*(H, J) \cong CM_{*+n}(H, J) = CM(H, J)[n]
.\]
:::

- Can start with an $H_0$ and rescale to define $H \da H_0/k$

\todo[inline]{Why?}

- When sufficiently small, periodic trajectories are constant
  - Thus $\crit(\mathcal{A}_H) = \crit(H)$
  - Implies that $H$ is a Morse function
  - Implies the for the Hessian $\spec(\nabla^2 H) \intersect 2\pi \ZZ = \emptyset$
  - Allows comparing Morse index of critical point to Maslov index of corresponding constant trajectory using
  \[  
  \ind_H(x) = \mu(x) + n
  .\]

- Gives an isomorphism of vector spaces, up to a dimension shift.

- Next need to show both differentials $\bd_M, \bd_F$ can be defined, and they coincide

- Defining $\bd_M$:
  - Need a vector field $X \in \Gamma(T*M)$ adapted to $H$
  - $X$ needs to satisfy Smale condition

\\todo[inline]{What is the Smale condition?}

- Then relate trajectories of $X$ to solutions of Floer equation, i.e. relate 
\[  
\corresond{
\text{Solutions to } \\
\dd{u}{s} + X(u) = 0 
}
\iff
\corresond{
\text{Solutions to } \\
\dd{u}{s} + J(u) \dd{u}{t} + \nabla H(u) = 0
}
.\]
  In other words: want $X = \nabla H$ for the metric induced by $J, \omega$.

:::{.theorem title="Theorem to Prove"}
Let $H$ be Morse on $(W, \omega)$.
Then there exists a dense subset $\mathcal{J}_{\text{reg}}(H)$ of almost complex structures $J$ calibrated by $\omega$ such that $(H, -JX_H)$ is Morse-Smale.

> Note: transversality result analogous to ones in 8.5

\todo[inline]{What is Morse-Smale?}

- Big idea: running ideas backwards, getting theorems for Morse functions similar to what we did when linearizing the Floer operator

- Proof in two steps:

  - Step 1: Morse Side, arbitrary morse functions
    - Linearize the Morse equation $\dd{u}{s} + X(u) = 0$ of the flow of $-X$ along one of its solutions $L_u Y = 0$.
    - Show that whenever $H$ is Morse and $u$ is a trajectory connecting critical points, $L_u$ is Fredholm and $\ind(L_u) = \ind_H(y) - \ind_H(x)$.
    - Show that for $H$ a nondegenerate Hamiltonian and $u$ a trajectory of $JX_H$, the operators $(d\mathcal{F})_u$ and $L_u$ are Fredholm of equal index.
    - Show that $X$ is Smale $\iff$ $L_u$ is surjective.
  - Step 2: Floer Side, specific case of Hamiltonian
    - Prove the actual result.

- Now fix an almost complex structure to obtain a Smale vector field $X$
- Compare solutions to Floer equation and trajectories of $X$
  - Solutions to Floer equation that *do not* depend on $t$ are precisely trajectories of $X = - \nabla H$.

- Next show that elements in $\ker (d\mathcal{F}_u)$ do not depend on $t$.
- Corollary: $\d\mathcal{F}_u$ is surjective along every trajectory of $\nabla H$.
- Then show that replacing $H_k \da H/k$ for $k\gg 0$ preserves all critical points and all indices
- Punch line: all the solutions of the Floer equation that we need are time-independent.
  - Statement: For $k\gg 0$, solutions to the Floer equation for $H_k$ connecting $x\to y$ with $\ind(x) - \ind(y) \leq 2$ are independent of $t$.

## Summary

\todo[inline]{What is $X_H$}

- Take $H_k$ for $k\gg 0$ and $J\in \mathcal{J}_{\text{reg}}$ (dense)
- Then when $\ind(x) - \ind(y) \leq 2$, trajectories of Floer equation for $(H, J)$ connecting critical points $x, y$ are trajectories of the Smale vector field $X = - JX_H$.
  - $x, y$ will be critical points for both $H$ and $\mathcal{A}_H$
- Regularity? The linearized Floer operator is surjective along these trajectories
- Implies that $\mathcal{M}^{(H, J)}(x, y)$ is a manifold, so $CF_*$ can be defined.
- Claim: this shows the differentials coincide, and we're done.



## Linearizing the Morse Equation

- Let $f$ be morse on $V \injects \RR^m$ ($m\gg 0$) with adapted pseudo-gradient field $X$, then
\[  
\correspond{
\text{Trajectories} \\
\text{of } X
}
\iff
\correspond{
\text{Solutions of} \\
\dd{u}{s} + X(u(s)) = 0
}
.\]

- Fix a metric $g$ on $V$ such that $X = \nabla_g f$.
- Define the space of solutions of finite energy:
\[  
E(u) \da 
\int_\RR \norm{\dd{u}{s}}^2 \,ds \\
\mathcal{M} \da \ts{
u \in C^\infty(\RR, V) \mid \dd{u}{s} + \nabla f = 0, \qquad E(u) < \infty
}
.\]

- Then $\mathcal{M}$ is compact and equal to $\union_{x, y} \mathcal{M}(x, y)$, using the fact that if $V$ is compact, *all* trajectories are of finite energy

- Now go to coordinates and linearize the equation of the flow along the solution $u$ to get a linear differential equation

- Yields an equation
\[  
L_u: W^{1, 2}(\RR, \RR^{n}) &\to L^2(\RR, \RR^{n}) \\
Y &\mapsto \dd{Y}{s} + A(s) Y \da L_u Y
,\]
  where $A$ is a matrix limiting to $\nabla_y^2 f$ and $\nabla_x^2 f$ at $s= \pm \infty$

  - Limiting to Hessians of nondegenerate critical points will yield symmetric invertible matrices

  - We then consider $\ker L_u \subseteq \ker(d\mathcal{F}_u)$. 
    Note: we have exponential decay.

- Note: the space of solutions to equation linearized at $u$ is $T_u \mathcal{M}(x, y)$.

### Showing $L_u$ is Fredholm

- Bootstrapping: $Y\in \ker \L_u$ in $W^{1, 2}$ is continuous, thus $C^1$, this $C^\infty$ and form a finite-dimensional vector space.

- Behavior at infinity: reduces to $L_uY = 0 \iff \dd{Y}{s} = -AY$ where $A$ is a constant diagonal matrix
  - This is a linear system, so solutions are $Y(s) = e^{-As}Y(0)$, i.e. $y_i(s) = y_i e^{- \lambda_i s}$.

- Will prove that if $u$ is a trajectory of $\nabla f$ connecting $x\to y$ then $L_u$ is Fredholm

  - Proof: involves bounding $W^{1, 2}$ norm of $Y$ by $L^2$ norms of $Y, L_u Y$.

  - Lots of integral estimates: Fourier transform, Plancherel, Cauchy-Schwarz

- Integral bound yields: $\dim \ker L_u < \infty$ and $\im L_u$ is closed.

- Lemma: $\dim \cok < \infty$.

  - Proof: computer kernel of adjoint $L_u^* = -\dd{}{s} + A^*$ where the matrix is transposed.

  - Use the fact that $Z\in \coker(L_u) \iff Z\in \ker(L_u^*)$, i.e. $L_u^* Z = 0$ in the sense of distributions

### Computing $\ind L_u$

- Unsurprisingly, will show $\ind(L_u) = \ind_f(x) - \ind_f(y)$.

- Ideas in proof:

  - Will choose two real numbers $\sigma, s$ to plug into $u$, and consider *resolvent*: map between tangent spaces to $V$ at $u(\sigma), u(s)$.
  - Look at the tangent spaces at $u(\sigma)$ of the stable and unstable manifolds
  \[  
  E^\text{u}(\sigma) \da T_{u(\sigma)} W^\text{u}(x) \\
  E^\text{s}(\sigma) \da T_{u(\sigma)} W^\text{s}(x) \\
  .\]
  - Then $\ker L_u$ is isomorphic to the intersection for all $\sigma$.

### Smale Condition

- Recall $X= \nabla_g f$ for $g$ a metric.

- Statement: the vector field $X$ satisfies the Smale condition $\iff$ all $L_u$ are surjective.

:::{.proof}
\hfill

- $L_u$ is surjective $\iff \cok(L_u) = 0 \iff \ker(L_u^*)$ is injective
- This is equivalent to 
\[  
T_{u(\sigma)} W^\text{u}(x) +
T_{u(\sigma)} W^\text{s}(x) = T_{u(\sigma)} V
.\]
- This is exactly the transversality condition for the stable and unstable manifolds
  - We want this for all critical points
:::

## 10.4: Morse and Floer Trajectories Coincide

- Note $\ker(L_u) \subset \ker(d\mathcal{F}_u)$ since
\[  
\qty{ \dd{}{s} + S(s) }Y = 0 \implies
\qty{ \dd{}{s} J\dd{}{t} + S(s) }Y = 0
,\]
  so just need to show reverse inclusion.


- Use a lemma: for $f: [0, 1] \to \RR$,
\[  
\norm{f}_{L^p([0, 1])}
\norm{\dd{f}{t}}_{L^p([0, 1])}
,\]
  then apply this to $f(t) \da Y(s, t)$ and $p = 2$.

- Yields an equation
\[  
\norm{\del_s Y}_{L^2}^2 + \norm{\del_t Y}_{L^2}^2 \leq \sup_s \norm{S(s)}_{\text{op}}^2 \norm{Y}_{L^2}^2 
\implies
\norm{Y}^2_{L^2} \leq \sup_s \norm{S(s)}_{\text{op}} 
\norm{}
.\]

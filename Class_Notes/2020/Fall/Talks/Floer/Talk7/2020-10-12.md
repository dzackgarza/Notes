Chapter 10: From Floer to Morse

- To be precise with notation, define
  - $CM_*(H, J)$ will be the morse complex associated with a Morse function $H$, its vector field $\nabla H$ the gradient for the metric defined by $J, \omega$.
  - $CF_*(H, J)$

:::{.theorem title="Main Goal"}
There exists a nondegenerate Hamiltonian that is sufficiently small in the $C^2$ topology for which both the Floer and Morse complexes are well-defined, and 
\[  
CF_*(H, J) \cong CM_{*+n}(H, J) = CM(H, J)[n]
.\]
:::

- Can start with an $H_0$ and rescale to define $H \da H_0/k$

\todo[inline]{Why?}

- When sufficiently small, periodic trajectories are constant
  - Thus $\crit(\mathcal{A}_H) = \crit(H)$
  - Implies that $H$ is a Morse function
  - Implies the for the Hessian $\spec(\nabla^2 H) \intersect 2\pi \ZZ = \emptyset$
  - Allows comparing Morse index of critical point to Maslov index of corresponding constant trajectory using
  \[  
  \ind_H(x) = \mu(x) + n
  .\]

- Gives an isomorphism of vector spaces, up to a dimension shift.

- Next need to show both differentials $\bd_M, \bd_F$ can be defined, and they coincide

- Defining $\bd_M$:
  - Need a vector field $X \in \Gamma(T*M)$ adapted to $H$
  - $X$ needs to satisfy Smale condition

\\todo[inline]{What is the Smale condition?}

- Then relate trajectories of $X$ to solutions of Floer equation, i.e. relate 
\[  
\corresond{
\text{Solutions to } \\
\dd{u}{s} + X(u) = 0 
}
\iff
\corresond{
\text{Solutions to } \\
\dd{u}{s} + J(u) \dd{u}{t} + \nabla H(u) = 0
}
.\]
  In other words: want $X = \nabla H$ for the metric induced by $J, \omega$.

:::{.theorem title="Theorem to Prove"}
Let $H$ be Morse on $(W, \omega)$.
Then there exists a dense subset $\mathcal{J}_{\text{reg}}(H)$ of almost complex structures $J$ calibrated by $\omega$ such that $(H, -JX_H)$ is Morse-Smale.

\\todo[inline]{What is Morse-Smale?}

- Proof in two steps:

  - Step 1:
    - Linearize the Morse equation $\dd{u}{s} + X(u) = 0$ of the flow of $-X$ along one of its solutions $L_u Y = 0$.
    - Show that whenever $H$ is Morse and $u$ is a trajectory connecting critical points, $L_u$ is Fredholm and $\ind(L_u) = \ind_H(y) - \ind_H(x)$.
    - Show that for $H$ a nondegenerate Hamiltonian and $u$ a trajectory of $JX_H$, the operators $(d\mathcal{F})_u$ and $L_u$ are Fredholm of equal index.
    - Show that $X$ is Smale $\iff$ $L_u$ is surjective.
  - Step 2:

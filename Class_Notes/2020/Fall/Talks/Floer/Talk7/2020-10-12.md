Chapter 10: From Floer to Morse

- To be precise with notation, define
  - $CM_*(H, J)$ will be the morse complex associated with a Morse function $H$, its vector field $\grad H$ the gradient for the metric defined by $J, \omega$.
  - $CF_*(H, J)$

:::{.theorem title="Main Goal"}
There exists a nondegenerate Hamiltonian that is sufficiently small in the $C^2$ topology for which both the Floer and Morse complexes are well-defined, and 
\[  
CF_*(H, J) \cong CM_{*+n}(H, J) = CM(H, J)[n]
.\]
:::

- Can start with an $H_0$ and rescale to define $H \da H_0/k$ (why?)

- When sufficiently small, periodic trajectories are constant
  - Thus $\crit(\mathcal{A}_H) = \crit(H)$
  - Implies that $H$ is a Morse function
  - Implies

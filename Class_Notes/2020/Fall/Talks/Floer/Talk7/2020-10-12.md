Chapter 10: From Floer to Morse

Goal:
Let $H$ be a nondegenerate autonomous Hamiltonian (so not time-dependent) which is sufficiently small in the $C^2$ topology.
We want to show that $CF_* \cong CM_*$



- To be precise with notation, define
  - $CM_*(H, J)$ will be the morse complex associated with a Morse function $H$, its vector field $\grad H$ the gradient for the metric defined by $J, \omega$.
  - $CF_*(H, J)$

Restated goal:
:::{.theorem title="Main Theorem"}
There exists a nondegenerate Hamiltonian that is sufficiently small in the $C^2$ topology for which both the Floer and Morse complexes are well-defined, and 
\[  
CF_*(H, J) \cong CM_{*+n}(H, J) = CM(H, J)[n]
.\]

- For $X, Y$ topological spaces, consider 
  \[  
  Y^X = C(X, Y) = \hom_\Top(X, Y) \da \ts{f: X\to Y \st f\,\,\text{is continuous}}
  .\]
  - Topologize with the *compact-open* topology: $U \in \hom_T(X, X)$ open iff for every $f\in U$, $f(K)$ is open for every compact $K\subseteq X$.
    - If $Y = (Y, d)$ is a metric space, this is the topology of "uniform convergence on compact sets": for $f_n \to f$ in this topology iff 
  \[  
  \norm{f_n - f}_{\infty, K} \da \sup \ts{d(f_n(x), f(x)) \st x\in K}\converges{n\to\infty}\to 0 \quad \forall K\subseteq X \,\,\text{compact}
  .\]
  In words: $f_n\to f$ uniformly on every compact set.

  - If $X$ itself is compact and $Y$ is a metric space, $C(X, Y)$ can be promoted to a metric space with $d(f, g) = \sup_{x\in X}(f(x), g(x))$.

- So define $\Map(X, Y) = \hom_{\Top}(X, Y)$ equipped with the compact-open topology.
  - Can immediately consider a lot of interesting spaces by considering $\Map(\wait, Y)$:
  \[  
  X= I \da [0, 1] & \leadsto\quad \mathcal{P}Y  \da \ts{f: I\to Y} = Y^I  \\
  X= S^1 &\leadsto\quad \mathcal{L}Y  \da \ts{f: S^1\to Y } = Y^{S^1} 
  .\]

  > Note: take basepoints to obtain the base path space $PY$, the based loop space $\Omega Y$.

  - Importance in homotopy theory: the path space fibration $\Omega(Y) \injects P(Y) \mapsvia{\gamma \mapsto \gamma(1)} Y$ (plays a role in "homotopy replacement", allows you to assume everything is a fibration and use homotopy long exact sequences).
  - Adjoint property: there is a homeomorphism
  \[  
  \Map(X\cross Z, Y) &\leftrightarrow_{\cong} \Map(Z, \Map(X, Y)) \\
  H:X\cross Z \to Y &\iff \tilde H: Z\to \Map(X, Y)\\
  (x, z) \mapsto H(x,z) &\iff z \mapsto H(\wait, z)
  .\]
  Categorically, $\hom(X, \wait) \leftrightarrow (X\cross \wait)$ form an adjoint pair in $\Top$.
  - Fun fact: with some mild point-set conditions (Locally compact and Hausdorff),
  \[  
  \pi_0 \Map(X, Y) = \ts{[f],\, \text{homotopy classes of maps }f: X\to Y}
  ,\]
  i.e. two maps $f, g$ are homotopic $\iff$ they are connected by a path in $\Map(X, Y)$.
    - Proof:
  \[  
    \mathcal{P}\Map(X, Y) = \Map(I, \Map(X, Y)) \cong \Map(Y\cross I, X)
  ,\]
    and just check that $\gamma(0) = f \iff H(x, 0) = f$ and $\gamma(1) = g \iff H(x, 1) = g$.

    - Note that we can interpret the RHS as the space of paths

  - Now we can bootstrap up to play fun recursive games by applying the pathspace *endofunctor* $\Map(I, \wait)$: define
  \[  
  \Map^1_I(X, Y) \da \Map(I, \Map(X, Y)) = \mathcal{P}\Map(X, Y)
  \]
  and then
  \[  
  \Map^2_I(X, Y) &\da \Map(I, \Map^1_I(X, Y)) \\
  &\cong \Map(I, \Map(I, \Map(X, Y))) \quad = \mathcal{P}\qty{\mathcal{P}(X, Y)}\\
  &\cong \Map(I, \Map(Y\cross I, X)) \\
  &\da \mathcal{P} \Map(Y\cross I, X)
  .\]
  Interpretation: we can consider paths in the *space* of paths, and paths between homotopies, and homotopies between homotopies, ad infinitum!

  - Since these are homeomorphisms, everything is invertible, so equip with function composition to form a group.

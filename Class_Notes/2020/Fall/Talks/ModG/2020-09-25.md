- For $X, Y$ topological spaces, consider 
  \[  
  \hom_\Top(X, Y) \da \ts{f: X\to Y \st f\,\,\text{is continuous}}
  .\]
  - Topologize with the *compact-open* topology: $U \in \hom_T(X, X)$ open iff for every $f\in U$, $f(K)$ is open for every compact $K\subseteq X$.
    - If $Y = (Y, d)$ is a metric space, this is the topology of "uniform convergence on compact sets": for $f_n \to f$ in this topology iff 
  \[  
  \norm{f_n - f}_{\infty, K} \da \sup \ts{d(f_n(x), f(x)) \st x\in K}\converges{n\to\infty}\to 0 \quad \forall K\subseteq X \,\,\text{compact}
  .\]
  In words: $f_n\to f$ uniformly on every compact set.
  - Some special cases:
    - $X = I$:
    \[  
    \mathcal{L}(X, x_0) \da \ts{f: S^1\to X \}
    .\]
  - Since these are homeomorphisms, everything is invertible, so equip with function composition to form a group.

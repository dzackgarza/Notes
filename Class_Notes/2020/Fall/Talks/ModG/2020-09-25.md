## Compact-Open Topology

## Isotopy

- Define a homotopy between $f, g: X\to Y$ as a map $F:S\cross I \to S$ restricting to $f, g$ on the ends.
  - Equivalently: a *path* in $\Map(X, Y)$.
- Isotopy: require the partially-applied function $F_t:S\to S$ to be homeomorphisms for every $t$.
  - Equivalently: a path in $\Map(X, Y)$



## Self-Homeomorphisms


- In any category, the automorphisms form a group. 

  - In a general category $\mathcal{C}$, we can always define the group $\Aut_{\mathcal{C}}(X)$.
    - If the group has a topology, we can consider $\pi_0 \Aut_{\mathcal{C}}(X)$, the set of path components.
    - Since groups have identities, we can consider $\Aut^0_{\mathcal{C}}(X)$, the path component containing the identity.

  - So we make a general definition, the *extended mapping class group*:
  \[  
  \MCG^\pm_{\mathcal{C}}(X) \da \Aut_{\mathcal{C}}(X) / \Aut_{\mathcal{C}}^0(X)
  .\]

  - Here the $\pm$ indicates that we take both orientation preserving and non-preserving automorphisms.

  - Has an index 2 subgroup of orientation-preserving automorphisms, $\MCG^+(X)$.

- Now restrict attention to
\[  
\Homeo(X) \da \Aut_{\Top}(X) = \ts{f\in \Map(X, X) \st f \text{ is an isomorphism}} \\
\qquad\text{equipped with }\OO_{\text{CO}}
.\]
  - Taking $\MCG^\pm_\Top(X)$ yields ??

- Similarly, we can do all of this in the smooth category:
\[  
\Diffeo(X) \da \Aut_{C^\infty}(X)
.\]
  - Taking $\MCG_{C^\infty}(X)$ yields ??

- Similarly, we can do this for the homotopy category of spaces:
\[  
\text{ho}(X) \da \ts{[f] }
.\]
  - Taking $\MCG(X)$ here yields *homotopy classes of self-homotopy equivalences*.

- For topological manifolds: Isotopy classes of homeomorphisms
  - In the compact-open topology, two maps are isotopic iff they are in the same component of $\pi \Aut(X)$.

- For surfaces:
  $\MCG(S)$ on the Teichmuller space $T(S)$, yielding a SES
  \[  
  0 \to \MCG(S) \to T(S) \to \widetilde{\mathcal{M}}_g(S) \to 0 
  \]
  where the last term is the moduli space of Riemann surfaces homeomorphic to $X$.

  - $T(S)$ is the moduli space of complex structures on $S$, up to the action of homeomorphisms that are isotopic to the identity:

    - Points are isomorphism classes of marked Riemann surfaces

  - Used in the Neilsen-Thurston Classification (for a compact orientable surface, a self-homeomorphism is isotopic to one which is any of: periodic: reducible (preserves some simple closed curves), or pseudo-Anosov (has directions of expansion/contraction))

- Generated by Dehn twists: a self homeomorphism

- Any finite group is $\MCG(X)$ for some compact hyperbolic 3-manifold $X$.

## Dehn Twists

:::{.claim}
Let $A \da \ts{z\in \CC \st 1\leq \abs z \leq 2}$, then $\MCG(A) \cong \ZZ$, generated by the map
\[  
\tau_0: \CC &\to \CC \\
z & \mapsto \exp{2\pi i \abs z}\, z
.\]

## Compact-Open Topology

- For $X, Y$ topological spaces, consider 
  \[  
  Y^X = C(X, Y) = \hom_\Top(X, Y) \da \ts{f: X\to Y \st f\,\,\text{is continuous}}
  .\]
  - General idea: it's nice to *cartesian closed* categories, which require *exponential objects* or *internal homs*: i.e. for every hom set, there is some object in the category that represents it (i.e. here we'd like the homs to again be spaces).
  - Can make this work if we assume WHCG: weakly Hausdorff and compactly generated.
    - Weakly Hausdorff: every continuous image of a compact Hausdorff space into it is closed.
    - Compactly generated: sets are closed iff their intersection with every compact subspace is closed.
  - Topologize with the *compact-open* topology $\OO_{\text{CO}}$: 
\[  
U \in \OO_{\text{CO}} \iff 
\forall f\in U, \quad f(K) \subset Y \text{ is open for every compact } K\subseteq X
.\]
  
    - If $Y = (Y, d)$ is a metric space, this is the topology of "uniform convergence on compact sets": for $f_n \to f$ in this topology iff 
  \[  
  \norm{f_n - f}_{\infty, K} \da \sup \ts{d(f_n(x), f(x)) \st x\in K}\converges{n\to\infty}\to 0 \quad \forall K\subseteq X \,\,\text{compact}
  .\]
  In words: $f_n\to f$ uniformly on every compact set.

  - If $X$ itself is compact and $Y$ is a metric space, $C(X, Y)$ can be promoted to a metric space with $d(f, g) = \sup_{x\in X}(f(x), g(x))$.

  - Useful in analysis: when is a family of functions $\mathcal{F} = \ts{f_\alpha} \subset \hom_\Top(X, Y)$ compact? Essentially answered by Arzela-Ascoli

  :::{.theorem title="Ascoli"}
 If $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff and $(Y, d)$ is a metric space, a family $\mathcal{F} \subset \hom_\Top(X, Y)$ has compact closure $\iff$ $\mathcal{F}$ is equicontinuous and $F_x \da \ts{f(x) \st f\in \mathcal{F}}\subset Y$ has compact closure.
  :::

  :::{.corollary title="Arzela"}
 If $\ts{f_n}\subset \hom_\Top(X, Y)$ is an equicontinuous sequence and $F_x \da \ts{f_n(x)}$ is bounded for every $X$, it contains a uniformly convergent subsequence.
  :::

  - Useful in Number Theory / Rep Theory / Fourier Series: can take $G$ to be a locally compact abelian topological group and define its Pontryagin dual $\hat G \da \hom_{\Top\Grp}(G, S^1)$ where we consider $S^1\subset \CC$.
    - Can integrate with respect to the Haar measure $\mu$, define $L^p$ spaces, and for $f\in L^p(G)$ define a Fourier transform $\hat f\in L^p(\hat G)$.
    \[  
    \hat f(\chi) \da \int_G f(x) \bar{\chi(x)} d\mu(x)
    .\]

- So define 
\[  
\Map(X, Y) \da (\hom_\Top(X, Y), \OO_{\text{CO}}) \qquad\text{where }\OO_{\text{CO}}\text{ is the compact-open topology}
.\]
$\Map(X, Y) = \hom_{\Top}(X, Y)$ equipped with the compact-open topology.
  - Can immediately consider some interesting spaces via the functor $\Map(\wait, Y)$:
  \[  
  X = \pt &\leadsto \quad \Map(\pt, Y) \cong Y \\
  X= I &\leadsto\quad \mathcal{P}Y  \da \ts{f: I\to Y} = Y^I  \\
  X= S^1 &\leadsto\quad \mathcal{L}Y  \da \ts{f: S^1\to Y } = Y^{S^1} 
  .\]

  > Note: take basepoints to obtain the base path space $PY$, the based loop space $\Omega Y$.

  - Importance in homotopy theory: the path space fibration $\Omega(Y) \injects P(Y) \mapsvia{\gamma \mapsto \gamma(1)} Y$ (plays a role in "homotopy replacement", allows you to assume everything is a fibration and use homotopy long exact sequences).
  - Adjoint property: there is a homeomorphism
  \[  
  \Map(X\cross Z, Y) &\leftrightarrow_{\cong} \Map(Z, \Map(X, Y)) \\
  H:X\cross Z \to Y &\iff \tilde H: Z\to \Map(X, Y)\\
  (x, z) \mapsto H(x,z) &\iff z \mapsto H(\wait, z)
  .\]
  Categorically, $\hom(X, \wait) \leftrightarrow (X\cross \wait)$ form an adjoint pair in $\Top$.
  
  > A form of this adjunction holds in any cartesian closed category.

  - Fun fact: with some mild point-set conditions (Locally compact and Hausdorff),
  \[  
  \pi_0 \Map(X, Y) = \ts{[f],\, \text{homotopy classes of maps }f: X\to Y}
  ,\]
  i.e. two maps $f, g$ are homotopic $\iff$ they are connected by a path in $\Map(X, Y)$.
    - Proof:
  \[  
    \mathcal{P}\Map(X, Y) = \Map(I, \Map(X, Y)) \cong \Map(Y\cross I, X)
  ,\]
    and just check that $\gamma(0) = f \iff H(x, 0) = f$ and $\gamma(1) = g \iff H(x, 1) = g$.

    - Note that we can interpret the RHS as the space of paths

  - Now we can bootstrap up to play fun recursive games by applying the pathspace *endofunctor* $\Map(I, \wait)$: define
  \[  
  \Map^1_I(X, Y) \da \Map(I, \Map(X, Y)) = \mathcal{P}\Map(X, Y)
  \]
  and then
  \[  
  \Map^2_I(X, Y) &\da \Map(I, \Map^1_I(X, Y)) \\
  &\cong \Map(I, \Map(I, \Map(X, Y))) \quad = \mathcal{P}\qty{\mathcal{P}(X, Y)}\\
  &\cong \Map(I, \Map(Y\cross I, X)) \\
  &\da \mathcal{P} \Map(Y\cross I, X)
  .\]
  Interpretation: we can consider paths in the *space* of paths, and paths between homotopies, and homotopies between homotopies, ad infinitum!

  > This in fact defines a *monad* on spaces: an endofunctor that behaves like a monoid.

## Isotopy

???

## Self-Homeomorphisms


- In any category, the automorphisms form a group. 

  - In a general category $\mathcal{C}$, we can always define the group $\Aut_{\mathcal{C}}(X)$.
    - If the group has a topology, we can consider $\pi_0 \Aut_{\mathcal{C}}(X)$, the set of path components.
    - Since groups have identities, we can consider $\Aut^0_{\mathcal{C}}(X)$, the path component containing the identity.

  - So we make a general definition:
  \[  
  \MCG_{\mathcal{C}}(X) \da \Aut_{\mathcal{C}}(X) / \Aut_{\mathcal{C}}^0(X)
  .\]

- Now restrict attention to
\[  
\Homeo(X) \da \Aut_{\Top}(X) = \ts{f\in \Map(X, X) \st f \text{ is an isomorphism}} \\
\qquad\text{equipped with }\OO_{\text{CO}}
.\]
  - Taking $\MCG_\Top(X)$ yields ??

- Similarly, we can do all of this in the smooth category:
\[  
\Diffeo(X) \da \Aut_{C^\infty}(X)
.\]
  - Taking $\MCG_{C^\infty}(X)$ yields ??

- Similarly, we can do this for the homotopy category of spaces:
\[  
\text{ho}(X) \da \ts{[f] }
.\]
  - Taking $\MCG(X)$ here yields *homotopy classes of self-homotopy equivalences*.

- For topological manifolds: Isotopy classes of homeomorphisms
  - In the compact-open topology, two maps are isotopic iff they are in the same component of $\pi \Aut(X)$.

- For surfaces:
  $\MCG(S)$ on the Teichmuller space $T(S)$, yielding a SES
  \[  
  0 \to \MCG(S) \to T(S) \to \widetilde{\mathcal{M}}_g(S) \to 0 
  \]
  where the last term is the moduli space of Riemann surfaces homeomorphic to $X$.

  - $T(S)$ is the moduli space of complex structures on $S$, up to the action of homeomorphisms that are isotopic to the identity.

    - Points are isomorphism classes of marked Riemann surfaces

  - Used in the Neilsen-Thurston Classification (for a compact orientable surface, a self-homeomorphism is isotopic to one which is any of: periodic: reducible (preserves some simple closed curves), or pseudo-Anosov (has directions of expansion/contraction))

- For $X, Y$ topological spaces, consider $\hom_\top(X, Y)$.
  - Topologize with the *compact-open* topology: $U \in \hom_T(X, X)$ open iff for every $f\in U$, $f(K)$ is open for every compact $K\subseteq X$.
    - If $Y = (Y, d)$ is a metric space, this is the topology of "uniform convergence on compact sets": for $f_n \to f$ in this topology iff 
  \[  
  \norm{f_n - f}_{\infty, K} \da \sup \ts{d(f_n(x), f(x)) \st x\in K}\converges{n\to\infty}\to 0 \quad \forall K\subseteq X \,\,\text{compact}
  .\]
  - Since these are homeomorphisms, everything is invertible, so equip with function composition to form a group.

- Always have a homology representation
\[  
\rho: \MCG(\Sigma_g) \to \Aut_\Grp H^1(\Sigma_g; \ZZ)
.\]
- For a surface of finite genus $g\geq 1$, elements in $\im \rho$ preserve the *algebraic intersection form*, which is a symplectic pairing.

- Thus there is a surjective representation
\[  
\rho: \MCG(\Sigma_g) \surjects \S
.\]

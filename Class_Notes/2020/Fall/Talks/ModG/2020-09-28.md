# Monday, September 28

- Surface: oriented, connected, 2nd countable, Hausdorff, 2 real-dimensional manifold with boundary (assumed empty)
- Curve: simple, closed, oriented

- Always have a homology representation
\[  
\rho: \MCG(\Sigma_g) \to \Aut_\Grp H^1(\Sigma_g; \ZZ)
.\]

- Kernel is the *Torelli group*.

- For a surface of finite genus $g\geq 1$, elements in $\im \rho$ preserve the *algebraic intersection form*, which is a symplectic pairing.

- Thus there is a surjective representation
\[  
\rho: \MCG(\Sigma_g) \surjects \Sp(2g; \ZZ)
.\]


- Every homology class in $H_1$ can be represented by a (possibly non-simple) loop.
- Algebraic intersection: a bilinear antisymmetric form $\hat \iota$ on $H_1(\Sigma_g; \ZZ)$
  - $x$ is isotropic iff $\iota(x, \wait) = 0$.

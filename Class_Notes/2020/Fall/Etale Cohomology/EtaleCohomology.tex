\hypertarget{what-is-etale-cohomology}{%
\subsection{What is Etale Cohomology?}\label{what-is-etale-cohomology}}

Suppose \(X/\CC\) is a quasiprojective variety: a finite type separated
integral \(\CC\dash\)scheme.

If you take the complex points, it naturally has the structure of a
complex analytic space \(X(\CC)^{\text{an}}\): you can give it the
Euclidean topology, which is much finer than the Zariski topology.

For a nice topological space, we can associate the singular cohomology
\(H^i(X(\CC)^{\text{an}}, \ZZ)\), which satisfies several nice
properties:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Finitely generated \(\ZZ\dash\)modules
\item
  Extra Hodge structure when tensored up to \(\CC\) (same as \(\CC\)
  coefficients)
\item
  Cycle classes (i.e.~associate to a subvariety a class in cohomology)
\end{itemize}

Goal of etale cohomology: do something similar for much more general
``nice'' schemes. Note that some of these properties are special to
complex varieties

E.g. finitely generated: not true for a random topological space

We'll associate \(X\) a ``nice scheme''
\(\rightsquigarrow H^i(X_{\text{et}}, \ZZ/\ell^n\ZZ)\). Take the inverse
limit over all \(n\) to obtain the \(\ell\dash\)adic cohomology
\(H^i(X_{\text{et}}, \ZZ_\ell)\). You can tensor with \(\QQ\) to get
something with \(\QQ_\ell\) coefficients. And as in singular cohomology,
you can a ``twisted coefficient system''.

What are nice schemes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(X = \spec \OO_k\), the ring of integers over a number field.
\item
  \(X\) a variety over an algebraically closed field

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Typical, most analogous to taking a variety over \(\CC\).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(X\) a variety over a non-algebraically closed field
\end{itemize}

Some comparisons between the last two cases:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For \(\CC\dash\) variety, \(H^i_{\text{sing}}\) will vanish above
  \(i=2d\).
\item
  Over a finite field, \(H^i\) will vanish for \(i>2d+1\) but generally
  not vanish for \(i=2d+1\).
\end{itemize}

In good situations, these are finitely generated
\(\ZZ/\ell^n\ZZ\dash\)modules, have Mayer-Vietoris and excision
sequences, spectral sequences, etc.

Related invariants: for a scheme with a geometric point
\((X, \bar x) \rightsquigarrow \pi_1^{\text{étale}}(X, \bar x)\), which
is a profinite topological group, which is a profinite topological
group.

\begin{quote}
Note: a geometric point is a map from \(\spec X\) to an algebraically
closed field.
\end{quote}

More invariants beyond the scope of this course:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Higher homotopy groups
\item
  Homotopy type (equivalence class of spaces)
\end{itemize}

So we want homotopy-theoretic invariants for varieties.

\begin{remark}

This cohomology theory is necessarily weird!

\begin{theorem}[Serre]

There does not exists a cohomology theory for schemes over
\(\bar{\FF}_q\) with the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Functorial
\item
  Satisfies the Kunneth formula
\item
  For \(E\) an elliptic curve, \(H^1(E) = \QQ^2\).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
Slogan: No cohomology theory with \(\QQ\) coefficients.
\end{quote}

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

Take \(E\) to be a supersingular elliptic curve. Then
\(\endo(E) \tensor \QQ\) is a quaternion algebra.

Fact: There are no algebra morphisms \(R\to \mat_{2\times 2}(\QQ)\)

\begin{exercise}

Functoriality and Kunneth implies that \(\endo(E)\actson E\) yields an
action on \(H^1(E)\), which is precisely an algebra morphism
\(\endo(E) \to \mat_{2\by 2}(\QQ)\), a contradiction.

\begin{quote}
The content: the sum of two endomorphisms act via their sum on \(H^1\).
\end{quote}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

Prove the same thing for \(\QQ_p\) coefficients, where \(p\) divides the
characteristic of the ground field.

\begin{quote}
Proof the same, just need to know what quaternion algebras show up.
\end{quote}

\end{exercise}

\end{proof}

\end{remark}

This forces using some funky type of coefficients.

\hypertarget{what-are-the-weil-conjectures}{%
\subsection{What are the Weil
Conjectures?}\label{what-are-the-weil-conjectures}}

Suppose \(X/\FF_q\) is a variety, then
\begin{align*}  
\zeta_X(t) = \exp{\sum_{n>0} { {\abs{X(\FF_{q^n})} \over n} t^n } }
.\end{align*}

Some comments:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\dd{}{t} \log \zeta_X(t)\) is an ordinary generating function for
  the number of rational points.
\item
  Slogan: locations of zeros and poles of a meromorphic function control
  the growth rate of the coefficients of the Taylor series of the
  logarithmic derivative.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exercise}

Make this slogan precise for rational functions, i.e.~ratios of two
polynomials.

\end{exercise}

The conjectures:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \(\zeta_x(t)\) is a rational function.
\item
  (Functional equation) For \(X\) smooth and proper
  \begin{align*}  
  \zeta_X(q^{-n} t\inv) = \pm q^{nE \over 2} t^E \zeta_X(t)
  .\end{align*}
\item
  (RH) All roots and poles of \(\zeta_X(t)\) have absolute value
  \(q^{i\over 2}\) with \(i\in \ZZ\), and these are equal to the \(i\)th
  Betti numbers if \(X\) lifts to characteristic zero.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
Note: we'll generalize betti numbers so this makes sense in general.
\end{quote}

All theorems! Proofs:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Dwork, using \(p\dash\)adic methods. Proof here will follow from the
  fact that \(H^i_{\text{étale} }\) are finite-dimensional. Related to
  Lefschetz Trace Formula (how Grothendieck thought about it).
\item
  Grothendieck, follows from some version of Poincaré duality.
\item
  (and 4) Deligne.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{euler-product}{%
\subsubsection{Euler Product}\label{euler-product}}

Let \(\abs X\) denote the closed points of \(X\), then there is an Euler
product:
\begin{align*}  
\zeta_X(q^{-n} t\inv) = \pm q^{nE \over 2} t^E \zeta_X(t)
&= \prod_{x\in \abs{X}} \exp{t^{\deg (x)} + {t^{2\deg (x)} \over 2} + \cdots} \\
&= \prod_{x\in \abs X} \exp{-\log(1-t^{\deg(x)})} \\
&= \prod_{x\in \abs X} {1 \over 1 - t^{\deg(x)}}
.\end{align*}

\begin{exercise}

Check the first equality. If you have a point of \(\deg(x) = n\), how
many \(\FF_{q^n}\) points does this contribute? I.e., how many maps are
there \(\spec(\FF_{q^n}) \to \spec(\FF_{q^n})\) over \(\FF_q\)?

There are exactly \(n\): it's \(\gal(\FF_{q^n} / \FF_q)\). But then
division by \(n\) drops this contribution to one.

\end{exercise}

We can keep going by expanding and multiplying out the product:
\begin{align*}  
\prod_{x\in \abs X} {1 \over 1 - t^{\deg(x)}}
&= \prod_{x\in \abs X} (1 + t^{\deg(x)} + t^{2 \deg(x)}) \\
&= \sum_{n\geq 0} \qty{\text{\# of Galois-stable subset of $X(\bar \FF_{q^n})$ of size $n$}}t^n
.\end{align*}

Why? If you have a degree \(x\) point, it contributes a stable subset of
size \(x\): namely the \(\FF_{q^n}\) points of \(\FF_{q^n}\). Taking
Galois orbits like that correspond to multiplying this product.

But these are the points of some algebraic variety:
\begin{align*}  
\cdots 
= \sum_{n\geq 0} \abs{\sym^n(X)(\FF_q)} t^n
,\end{align*} where \(\sym^n(X) \da X^n/\Sigma_n\), the action of the
symmetric group. Why is that? A \(\bar \FF_q\) point of \(\sym^n(X)\) is
an unordered \(n\dash\)tuple of \(\bar \FF_q\) points without an
ordering, and asking them to be Galois stable is the same as saying that
they are an \(\FF_q\) point.

\begin{theorem}[First Weil Conjecture for Curves]

For \(X\) a smooth proper curve over \(\FF_q\), \(\zeta_X(t)\) is
rational.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

Claim: there is a set map
\begin{align*}  
\sym^n X &\to \pic^n X \\
D &\mapsto \OO(D)
.\end{align*}

\begin{quote}
Here the divisor is an \(n\dash\)tuple of points.
\end{quote}

What are the fibers over a line bundle \(\OO(D)\)? A linear system,
i.e.~the projectivization of global sections \(\PP \Gamma(X, \OO(D))\).
What is the expected dimension? To compute the dimension of the space of
line bundles on a curve, use Riemann-Roch:
\begin{align*}  
\dim \PP\Gamma(X, \OO(D)) = \deg(D) + 1 - g + \dim H^1(X, \OO(D)) - 1
.\end{align*} where the last \(-1\) comes from the fact that this is a
projective space.

Claim: if \(\deg(D) = 2g-2\), then \(H^1(X, \OO(D)) = 0\).

This is because it's dual to \(H^0(X, \OO(K-D))\dual\), but this has
negative degree and a line bundle of negative degree can never have
sections.

\begin{quote}
Note: should check to make sure you know why this is true!
\end{quote}

Thus the fibers are isomorphic to \(\PP^{n-g}\) for \(n>2g-2\). Now make
a reduction (exercise: justify why):

Wlog assume \(X(\FF_q) \neq \emptyset\). In this case,
\(\pic^n(X) \cong \pic^{n+1}(X)\) for all \(n\), since you can take
\(\OO(P)\) for \(P\) a point, a degree 1 line bundle, and tensor with
it. It's an isomorphism because you can tensor with the dual bundle to
go back.

Thus for all \(n>2g-2\),
\begin{align*}  
\abs{\sym^n(X)(\FF_q)} 
= \abs{\PP^{n-g}(\FF_q)} \cdot \abs{\pic^n(X)(\FF_q)}
= \abs{\PP^{n-g}(\FF_q)} \cdot \abs{\pic^0(X)(\FF_q)}
.\end{align*}

Thus \(\zeta_X(t)\) is a polynomial plus
\(\sum_{n>2g-2} \abs{\pic^n(X)(\FF_q)}\qty{1+q+q^2+\cdots+q^{n-g}}t^n\).

\begin{exercise}

Show that this is a rational function using the formula for a geometric
series.

\end{exercise}

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Functional Equation]

The functional equation in the case of curves:
\begin{align*}  
\zeta_X(q^{-1} t^{-1} ) = \pm q^{2-2g \over 2} t^{2-2g} \zeta_X(t)
.\end{align*}

\end{theorem}

\begin{exercise}[Important]

Where it comes from in terms of \(\sym^n\): Serre duality.

\end{exercise}

We'll show the RH later.

\begin{theorem}[Dwork]

Suppose \(X/\FF_q\) is any variety, then \(\zeta_X(t)\) is rational
function.

\end{theorem}

\begin{quote}
Roughly known to Weil, hinted at in original paper
\end{quote}

\begin{proof}[Grothendieck]

Idea: take Frobenius (intentionally vague, arithmetic vs geometric vs
\ldots) \(F:X\to X\), then \(X(\FF_q)\) are the fixed points of \(F\)
acting on \(X_{\bar \FF_q}\), and the \(\FF_{q^n}\) points are the fixed
points of \(F^n\).

Uses the Lefschetz fixed point formula, which will say for
\(\ell\neq \ch(\FF_q)\),
\begin{align*}  
\abs{X(\FF_{q^n})} = \sum_{i=0}^{2\dim(X)} (-1)^i \tr(F^n) H^i_c(X_{\FF_q}, \QQ_\ell)
.\end{align*}

\begin{quote}
Here \(H^i_c\) is compactly supported cohomology, we'll define this
later in the course.
\end{quote}

\begin{lemma}

\begin{align*}  
\exp{\sum {\tr(F^n) \over n}t^n  }\quad\text{is rational}
.\end{align*}

\end{lemma}

This lemma implies the result, because if you plug the trace formula
into the zeta function, you'll get an alternating product
\(f \cdots {1\over g} \cdot h \cdot {1\over j} \cdots\) of functions of
the form in the lemma, which is still rational.

\begin{proof}[Of Lemma]

It suffices to treat the case \(\dim(V) = 1\), because otherwise you can
just write this as a sum of powers of eigenvalues.

Then you have a scalar matrix, so you obtain
\begin{align*}  
\exp{ \sum {\alpha^n \over n} t^n} = \exp{ -\log(1 - \alpha t)} = {1 \over 1-\alpha t}
,\end{align*} which is rational.

\end{proof}

\end{proof}

This proves rationality, contingent on

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The Lefschetz fixed point formula
\item
  The finite dimensionality of etale cohomology
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}

Try to figure out how Poincaré duality should give the functional
equation.

\begin{quote}
Hint: try the lemma on a vector space where \(F\) scales a bilinear
form.
\end{quote}

\end{exercise}

\begin{theorem}[Serre, Kahler Analog]

Suppose \(X/\CC\) is a smooth projective variety and
\([H] \in H^2(X(\CC), \CC)\) is a hyperplane class (corresponds to
intersection of generic hyperplane or the first Chern class of an ample
line bundle).

Suppose \(F:X\to X\) is an endomorphism such that \(f^*[H] = q[H]\) for
some \(q\in \ZZ_{\geq 1}\).

Define
\begin{align*}  
L(F^n) \definedas 
\sum_{i=0}^{2\dim(X)} (-1)^i \tr\qty{ F^n \st H^i(X_{\FF_q}, \QQ_\ell)}
.\end{align*} and
\begin{align*}  
\zeta_{X, F}(t) \da
\exp{\sum_{n=1}^\infty {L(F^n) \over n}t^n }
.\end{align*}

Then \(\zeta_{X, F}(t)\) satisfies the RH: the zeros and poles are of
absolute value \(q^{i\over 2}\). Equivalently, the eigenvalues
\(\lambda\) of \(F^n\) actings on \(H^i(X, \CC)\) all satisfy
\(\abs{\lambda} = q^{i\over 2}\).

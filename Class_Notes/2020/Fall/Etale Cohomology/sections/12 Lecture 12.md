## Brauer Groups

Goal: for $C$ a curve over $k=\bar k$, we've computed
\[ 
H^i(C, \GG_m) 
= 
\begin{cases}
\OO_C\units(C) & i=0\\
\Pic(C) & i=1 \\
0 & i > 1
\end{cases}
.\]
Currently $i>1$ is a mystery, so today we'll look at $i=2$.
Recall that we've reduced this to the Galois cohomology of the function field $H^i(k(C), \GG_m)$ and of the strict Henselization
[^strict_hensel]
$H^i(K_{\bar x}, \GG_m)$, 

[^strict_hensel]: 
The stalk of the structure sheaf, $\OO_{C,x}$.

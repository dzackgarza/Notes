Last time: we started fppf descent, and wanted to show the quasicoherent sheaves and representable functors give sheaves on $X_{\et}$ and $X_{\fppf}$.
Given a quasicoherent sheaf, we take the associated presheaf on the étale site given by taking the values of its pullback to any object on the étale site.
This yields a sheaf on the étale site, and we'll also conclude that representable functors yield such sheaves as well.

# Lecture 08: Computing Étale Cohomology

Recall the definition of $\check{C}(U/X, \mathcal{F})$ and $\check{C}(X_\et, \mathcal{F})$ (\cref{}).


:::{.warnings}
$\Hc{X_\et, \mathcal{F}} \not\cong H(X_\et, \mathcal{F})$ in general, but by a theorem of Milne this is true if $X$ is quasicompact any finite subset is contained in an affine open.
This is true if $X$ is quasiprojective.

:::{.remark}
There is a version for which this does always work where Čech covers are replaced with **hpyercovers**.

## Čech to Derived Spectral Sequence

Since we have enough injectives, take an injective resolution $\mathcal{F}\to \mathcal{I}^0 \to \cdots$ which is exact and each $\mathcal{I}^j$ is injective.
We can apply the Čech complex functor to obtain a double complex 
\[
\Cc^\wait(U/X, \mathcal{I}^0) \to \Cc^\wait(U/X, \mathcal{I}^1) \to \cdots
.\]

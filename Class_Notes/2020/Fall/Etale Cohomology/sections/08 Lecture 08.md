# Lecture 08: Computing Ã‰tale Cohomology

Recall the definition of $\check{C}(U/X, \mathcal{F})$ and $\check{C}(X_\et, \mathcal{F})$ (\cref{}).


:::{.warnings}
$\Hc{X_\et, \mathcal{F}} \not\cong H(X_\et, \mathcal{F})$ in general, but by a theorem of Milne this is true if $X$ is quasicompact any finite subset is contained in an affine open.
This is true if $X$ is quasiprojective.

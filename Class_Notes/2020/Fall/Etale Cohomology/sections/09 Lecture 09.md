Last time:

- The Čech-to-derived spectral sequence,
- The Mayer Vietoris LES,
  - Computes the étale cohomology of a scheme using a Zariski open cover.
- Étale cohomology of quasicoherent sheaves,
  - Agrees with Zariski cohomology, first legitimate computation!
  - Use this to compute:
- Étale cohomology of $\ul{\FF_p}$ in characteristic $p$.

Last time we had a scheme $X_{/\FF_p}$ and the *Artin-Schreier* exact sequence of sheaves of $X_\et$:
\[  
0\to \ul{\FF_p} \to \OO_X^\et \mapsvia{t\mapsto t^p - t} \OO_X^\et \to 0
.\]

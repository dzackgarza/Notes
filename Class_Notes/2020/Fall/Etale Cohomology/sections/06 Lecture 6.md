:::{.remark title="A technical point"}
Last time a theorem was stated that pullback induced an equivalence of categories $\Qcoh(X_{\zar}) \mapsvia{\sim} \QCoh(X_{\et}) \mapsvia{\sim} \QCoh(X)(X_{\fppf})$; note that these are the little sites.
What about the big sites?
There are similar equivalences between the three corresponding big sites, but in general, $\Qcoh(X_{\Zar}) \neq \QCoh(X_{\zar})$.

For example, a quasicoherent sheaf on the big Zariski site is a quasicoherent sheaf on every $X\dash$scheme and morphisms between various pullbacks.
This isn't as affected by what sheaf you have on $X$ itself.

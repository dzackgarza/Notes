Last time: stalks, sheafification, and $\Sh(X_{\et})$ is abelian.

:::{.remark}
Related to a question asked by a viewer: there is not in fact a morphism from $X_{\fppf} \to X_{\et}$, since locally finitely-presented need not be finitely presented (part of the condition for fppf).
There is instead a morphism $X_{\fppf}\to X_{\et, \text{fp}}$ to a corresponding finitely presented site. 
There is also a map $X_{\et} \to X_{\et, \text{fp}}$ inducing an equivalence on the category of sheaves via pushforward.

What is Etale Cohomology?
Suppose $X/\CC$ is a quasiprojective variety: a finite type separated integral $\CC\dash$scheme.

If you take the complex points, it naturally has the structure of a complex analytic space $X(\CC)^{\text{an}}$: you can give it the Euclidean topology, which is much finer than the Zariski topology.

For a nice topological space, we can associate the singular cohomology $H^i(X(\CC)^{\text{an}}, \ZZ)$, which satisfies several nice properties:

- Finitely generated $\ZZ\dash$modules
- Extra Hodge structure when tensored up to $\CC$ (same as $\CC$ coefficients)
- Cycle classes (i.e. associate to a subvariety a class in cohomology)

Goal of etale cohomology: do something similar for much more general "nice" schemes.
Note that some of these properties are special to complex varieties

E.g. finitely generated: not true for a random topological space

We'll associate $X$ a "nice scheme" $\rightsquigarrow H^i(X_{\text{et}}, \ZZ/\ell^n\ZZ)$.
Take the inverse limit over all $n$ to obtain the $\ell\dash$adic cohomology $H^i(X_{\text{et}}, \ZZ_\ell)$.
You can tensor with $\QQ$ to get something with $\QQ_\ell$ coefficients.
And as in singular cohomology, you can a "twisted coefficient system".

What are nice schemes:

- $X = \spec \OO_k$, the ring of integers over a number field.
- $X$ a variety over an algebraically closed field
  - Typical, most analogous to taking a variety over $\CC$.
- $X$ a variety over a non-algebraically closed field
  
Some comparisons between the last two cases:

- For $\CC\dash$ variety, $H^i_{\text{sing}}$ will vanish above $i=2d$.
- Over a finite field, $H^i$ will vanish for $i>2d+1$ but generally not vanish for $i=2d+1$. 

In good situations, these are finitely generated $\ZZ/\ell^n\ZZ\dash$modules, have Mayer-Vietoris and excision sequences, spectral sequences, etc.

Related invariants: for a scheme with a geometric point $(X, \bar x) \rightsquigarrow \pi_1^{\text{étale}}(X, \bar x)$, which is a profinite topological group, which is a profinite topological group.

> Note: a geometric point is a map from $\spec X$ to an algebraically closed field.

More invariants beyond the scope of this course:

- Higher homotopy groups
- Homotopy type (equivalence class of spaces)

So we want homotopy-theoretic invariants for varieties.

:::{.remark}
This cohomology theory is necessarily weird!

:::{.theorem title="Serre"}
There does not exists a cohomology theory for schemes over $\bar{\FF}_q$ with the following properties:

1. Functorial
2. Satisfies the Kunneth formula
3. For $E$ an elliptic curve, $H^1(E) = \QQ^2$.

> Slogan: No cohomology theory with $\QQ$ coefficients. 

:::
:::{.proof}
Take $E$ to be a supersingular elliptic curve.
Then $\endo(E) \tensor \QQ$ is a quaternion algebra.

Fact: There are no algebra morphisms $R\to \mat_{2\times 2}(\QQ)$

:::{.exercise}
Functoriality and Kunneth implies that $\endo(E)\actson E$ yields an action on $H^1(E)$, which is precisely an algebra morphism $\endo(E) \to \mat_{2\by 2}(\QQ)$, a contradiction.

> The content: the sum of two endomorphisms act via their sum on $H^1$.
:::

:::{.exercise}
Prove the same thing for $\QQ_p$ coefficients, where $p$ divides the characteristic of the ground field.

> Proof the same, just need to know what quaternion algebras show up.

This forces using some funky type of coefficients.


What are the Weil Conjectures?

Suppose $X/\FF_q$ is a variety, then 
\[  
\zeta_X(t) = \exp{\sum_{n>0} { {\abs{X(\FF_{q^n})} \over n} t^n } }
.\]

Some comments:

- $\dd{}{t} \log \zeta_X(t)$ is an ordinary generating function for the number of rational points.
- Slogan: locations of zeros and poles of a meromorphic function control the growth rate of the coefficients of the Taylor series of the logarithmic derivative.

:::{.exercise}
Make this slogan precise for rational functions, i.e. ratios of two polynomials.
:::

The conjectures:

1. $\zeta_x(t)$ is a rational function.

2. (Functional equation) For $X$ smooth and proper
\[  
\zeta_X(q^{-n} t\inv) = \pm q^{nE \over 2} t^E \zeta_X(t)
.\]

3. (RH) All roots and poles of $\zeta_X(t)$ have absolute value $q^{i\over 2}$ with $i\in \ZZ$, and these are equal to the $i$th Betti numbers if $X$ lifts to characteristic zero.

  > Note: we'll generalize betti numbers so this makes sense in general.

All theorems! Proofs:

1. Dwork, using $p\dash$adic methods. 
  Proof here will follow from the fact that $H^i_{\text{étale} }$ are finite-dimensional.
  Related to Lefschetz Trace Formula (how Grothendieck thought about it).

2. Grothendieck, follows from some version of Poincaré duality.

3. (and 4) Deligne.

Euler Product:

Let $\abs X$ denote the closed points of $X$, then there is an Euler product:

\[  
\zeta_X(q^{-n} t\inv) = \pm q^{nE \over 2} t^E \zeta_X(t)
&= \prod_{x\in \abs{X}} \exp{t^{\deg (x)} + {t^{2\deg (x)} \over 2} + \cdots} \\
&= \prod_{x\in \abs X} \exp{-\log(1-t^{\deg(x)})} \\
&= \prod_{x\in \abs X} {1 \over 1 - t^{\deg(x)}}
.\]

:::{.exercise}
Check the first equality.
If you have a point of $\deg(x) = n$, how many $\FF_{q^n}$ points does this contribute?
I.e., how many maps are there $\spec(\FF_{q^n}) \to \spec(\FF_{1^n})$ over $\FF_q$?

There are exactly $n$: it's $\gal(\FF_{q^n} / \FF_q)$.
But then division by $n$ drops this contribution to one.
:::

We can keep going by expanding and multiplying out the product:
\[  
\prod_{x\in \abs X} {1 \over 1 - t^{\deg(x)}}
&= \prod_{x\in \abs X} (1 + t^{\deg(x)} + t^{2 \deg(x)}) \\
&= \sum_{n\geq 0} \qty{\text{\# of Galois-stable subset of $X(\bar \FF_{q^n})$ of size $n$}}t^n
.\]

Why? 
If you have a degree $x$ point, it contributes a stable subset of size $x$: namely the $\FF_{q^n}$ points of $\FF_{q^n}$. 
Taking Galois orbits like that correspond to multiplying this product.

But these are the points of some algebraic variety:
\[  
\cdots 
= \sum_{n\geq 0} \abs{\sym^n(X)(\FF_q)} t^n
,\]
where $\sym^n(X) \da X^n/\Sigma_n$, the action of the symmetric group.
Why is that?
A $\bar \FF_q$ point of $\sym^n(X)$ is an unordered $n\dash$tuple of $\bar \FF_q$ points without an ordering, and asking them to be Galois stable is the same as saying that they are an $\FF_q$ point.


:::{.theorem title="First Weil Conjecture for Curves"}
For $X$ a smooth proper curve over $\FF_q$, $\zeta_X(t)$ is rational.
:::

:::{.proof}
Claim: there is a set map 
\[  
\sym^n X &\to \pic^n X \\
D &\mapsto \OO(D)
.\]

> Here the divisor is an $n\dash$tuple of points.

What are the fibers over a line bundle $\OO(D)$?
A linear system, i.e. the projectivization of global sections $\PP \Gamma(X, \OO(D))$.
What is the expected dimension? 
To compute the dimension of the space of line bundles on a curve, use Riemann-Roch:
\[  
\dim \PP\Gamma(X, \OO(D)) = \deg(D) + 1 - g + \dim H^1(X, \OO(D)) - 1
.\]
where the last $-1$ comes from the fact that this is a projective space.

Claim: if $\deg(D) = 2g-2$, then $H^1(X, \OO(D)) = 0$.

This is because it's dual to $H^0(X, \OO(K-D))\dual$, but this has negative degree and a line bundle of negative degree can never have sections.

> Note: should check to make sure you know why this is true!

Thus the fibers are isomorphic to $\PP^{n-g}$ for $n>2g-2$.
Now make a reduction (exercise: justify why):


Wlog assume $X(\FF_q) \neq \emptyset$.
In this case, $\pic^n(X) \cong \pic^{n+1}(X)$ for all $n$, since you can take $\OO(P)$ for $P$ a point, a degree 1 line bundle, and tensor with it.
It's an isomorphism because you can tensor with the dual bundle to go back.

Thus for all $n>2g-2$,
\[  
\abs{\sym^n(X)(\FF_q)} 
= \abs{\PP^{n-g}(\FF_q)} \cdot \abs{\pic^n(X)(\FF_q)}
= \abs{\PP^{n-g}(\FF_q)} \cdot \abs{\pic^0(X)(\FF_q)}
.\]

Thus $\zeta_X(t)$ is a polynomial plus $\sum_{n>2g-2} \abs{\pic^n(X)(\FF_q)}\qty{1+q+q^2+\cdots+q^{n-g}}t^n$.

:::{.exercise}
Show that this is a rational function using the formula for a geometric series.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Functional Equation"}
The functional equation in the case of curves:
\[  
\zeta_X(q^{-1} t^{-1} ) = \pm q^{2-2g \over 2} t^{2-2g} \zeta_X(t)
.\]
:::

:::{.exercise title="Important"}
Where it comes from in terms of $\sym^n$: Serre duality.
:::

We'll show the RH later.

:::{.theorem title="Dwork"}
Suppose $X/\FF_q$ is any variety, then $\zeta_X(t)$ is rational function.
:::

> Roughly known to Weil, hinted at in original paper

:::{.proof title="Grothendieck"}
Idea: take Frobenius (intentionally vague, arithmetic vs geometric vs ...) $F:X\to X$, then $X(\FF_q)$ are the fixed points of $F$ acting on $X_{\bar \FF_q}$, and the $\FF_{q^n}$ points are the fixed points of $F^n$.

Uses the Lefschetz fixed point formula, which will say for $\ell\neq \ch(\FF_q)$,
\[  
\abs{X(\FF_{q^n})} = \sum_{i=0}^{2\dim(X)} (-1)^i \tr(F^n) H^i_c(X_{\FF_q}, \QQ_\ell)
.\]

> Here $H^i_c$ is compactly supported cohomology, we'll define this later in the course.

\[  
\exp{\sum {\tr(F^n) \over n}t^n  }\qquad\text{is rational}

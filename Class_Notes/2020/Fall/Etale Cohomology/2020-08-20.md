Prerequisites:

- Homological Algebra
  - Abelian Categories
  - Derived Functors
  - Spectral Sequences (just exposure!)
- Sheaf theory and sheaf cohomology
- Schemes (Hartshorne II and III)

Outline/Goals:

- Basics of etale cohomology
  - Etale morphism
  - Grothendieck topologies
  - The etale topology
  - Etale cohomology and the basis theorems
  - Etale cohomology of curves
  - Comparison theorems to singular cohomology

- Prove the Weil Conjectures (more than one proof)
  - Proving the Riemann Hypothesis for varieties over finite fields

  > One of the greatest pieces of 20th century mathematics!

- Topics
  - Weil 2 (Strengthening of RH, used in practice)
  - Formality of algebraic varieties (topological features unique to varieties)
  - Other things (monodromy, refer to Kass' AWS notes)


What is Etale Cohomology?
Suppose $X/\CC$ is a quasiprojective variety: a finite type separated integral $\CC\dash$scheme.

If you take the complex points, it naturally has the structure of a complex analytic space $X(\CC)^{\text{an}}$

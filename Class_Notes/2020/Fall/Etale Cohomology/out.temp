\begin{question}
```
Suppose $\mathfrak{F}\in \qcoh(X)$. When does it come from a
quasicoherent sheaf on $X$? I.e., when is there a quasicoherent sheaf
$\mathcal{F}'$ on $X$ and an isomorphism between its pullback to $U$ and
$\mathcal{F}$? What extra structure do you need to "descend" to
$\qcoh(X)$, i.e.Â to pick such an isomorphism?

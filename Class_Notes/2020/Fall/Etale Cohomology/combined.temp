$\mathcal{F}^{\et}$

:::{.definition title="Some text $\mathcal{F}^{\et}$ and some more"}
The sheaf associated to the above functor on $X_{\et}$ will be denoted $\mathcal{F}^\text{Ã©tale}$.

:::{.proof title="of 2"}
Suppose we have an fppf cover of $X$
\begin{tikzcd}
U = \disjoint U_i \ar[d] \\
X
\end{tikzcd}
:::

:::{.question}
Suppose $\mathfrak{F}\in \qcoh(X)$.
When does it come from a quasicoherent sheaf on $X$?
I.e., when is there a quasicoherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}'$ on $X$ and an isomorphism between its pullback to $U$ and $\mathcal{F}$?
What extra structure do you need to "descend" to $\qcoh(X)$, i.e. to pick such an isomorphism?

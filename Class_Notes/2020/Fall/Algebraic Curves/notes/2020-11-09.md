## Chapter 1

Let $k$ be a field, not necessarily algebraically closed.

:::{.definition title="Algebraic Function Field"}
An one variable **algebraic function field** $F/K$ is a field extension $F$ of $K$ which factors as 

\begin{tikzcd}
F \ar[dr, "\text{algebraic}"] & \\
& k(x) \ar[dl, "\text{transcendental}"] \\
k
\end{tikzcd}

where $x\in \bar{k}$ is some element that is not algebraic over $k$.
:::

:::{.definition title="Field of Constants"}
The subfield
\[  
\tilde{k} \da \ts{z\in F \intersect K^{\text{alg}}} \leq F
,\]
consisting of elements that are algebraic over $F$ is denoted the **field of constants**.
:::

:::{.definition title="Algebraically Closed"}
If $\tilde k = k$, we say that $k$ is **algebraically closed** in $F$.
:::

:::{.definition title="Rational Function Field"}
An extension $F/k$  is **rational** iff $F = k(y)$ for some $y\in k^{\text{transc}}$ which is transcendental over $k$.
:::

:::{.definition title="Valuation Ring"}
A ring $\OO \subseteq F$ is a **valuation ring** for $F$ iff $k\subset \OO \subseteq  F$ and $z\in F \implies z\in \OO$ or $z^{-1} \in \OO$.

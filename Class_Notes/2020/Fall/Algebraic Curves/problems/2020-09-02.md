:::{.exercise title="0.9"}
Let $k$ be a field and $d\geq 2$ with $f\notdivides d$ and $p\in k[x]$ a polynomial of positive degree.

Factor $p$ in $\bar k[x]$ as $\prod_{i=1}^r (x-a_i)^{e_i}$, and suppose there is some $i$ such that $d\notdivides e_i$.
Show that
\[  
f(x,y) \da y^d - p(x)  \in k[x, y]
\]
is geometrically irreducible.

Conclude that
\[  
ff\qty{ k[x, y] / \gens{f} }
.\]
is a regular one-variable function field over $k$.

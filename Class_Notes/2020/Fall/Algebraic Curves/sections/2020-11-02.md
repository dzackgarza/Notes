# Lecture 14: Monday, November 02

Recall the that *Hasse-Weil zeta function* of a one-variable function field $K/\FF_q$ over a finite ground field is defined in the following way: 
let $A_n = A_n(K)$ be the number of effective divisors of degree $n$.
We have proved that $A_n$ is finite, and for $n>2g-2$ we have a formula
\[  
Z(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty A_n t^n
= \sum_{D\in \Div^+(K)} t^{\deg(D)} \in \ZZ[[t]]
,\]
which is a formal power series with integer coefficients.

:::{.remark}
Recall that we have proved that it is a rational function of $t$, and in particular when $g=0, \delta = 1$
[^delta_def_reminder] we get
\[  
Z(t) = {1 \over (1-qt)(1-t)}
.\]

We got another expression which isn't fantastic: it involves this $\delta$, which we'll work toward proving is equal to 1.
When $g>1$, we broke the zeta function into two pieces $Z(t) = F(t) + G(t)$.
For divisors of sufficiently high degree, Riemann-Roch tells you what the dimension of the Riemann-Roch space is, and $G(t)$ explains the part coming from divisors of large degree.
We obtained a formula previously for $F(t)$ and $G(t)$, and once we show $\delta=1$ the formula for $G$ will simplify.
For $F(t)$, we specifically had
\[  
F(t) = {1\over q-1} \sum_{0\leq \deg(c) \leq 2g-2} q^{\ell(c) t^{\deg(c)}}
,\]
where the sum is over divisor classes and $\ell$ is the dimension of linear system corresponding to a divisor.
But this isn't a great formula: what are these classes, dhow many are in each degree, and what is the dimension of the Riemann-Roch space?

[^delta_def_reminder]: The *index* of the function field, least positive degree of a divisor.

:::{.remark}
This is analogous to the Dedekind zeta function of a number field $K$, in which case
\[  
\zeta_K(s) = \sum_{T\in \ell(\ZZ_k)}^\bullet \abs{\ZZ_k/I}^{-s}
,\]
which will be covered in a separate lecture on *Serre zeta functions*.

:::{.theorem title="F.K. Schmidt"}
For all $K/\FF_q$, we have $\delta = I(K) = 1$ where $I$ is the index.
:::

This will follow from the associated, but it much weaker.
However, this is one of the facts we'd like to establish to use to *prove* the Riemann hypothesis.

:::{.remark}
Pete studied this in 2004 and found that every $I\in \ZZ^+$ arises as the index of a genus one function field $K/\QQ$.

Notation: for $n\in\ZZ^+$, let $\mu_n$ denote the $n$th roots of unity in $\CC$.

:::{.lemma title="?"}
For $m, r\in \ZZ^+$, set $d \da \gcd(m, r)$.
Then
\[  
\qty{1-t^{mr/d}}^d = \prod_{\xi\in \mu_r}  1 - (\xi t)^m
.\]
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
In $\CC[x]$, we  have
\[  
(X^{r/1} - 1)^d = \prod_{\xi\in \mu_r}(X - \xi^m)
,\]
where both sides are monic polynomials whose roots include the $(r/d)$th roots of unity, each with multiplicity $d$.
On the LHS, the distinct roots are the $r/d$th roots of unity, then raising to the $d$th power gives them multiplicity $d$.
On the RHS, this is an exercise in cyclic groups: consider the $n$th power map on $\ZZ/r\ZZ$ and compute its image and kernel.
As $\xi$ ranges over $r$th roots of unity, $\xi^m$ ranges over all $r/d$th roots of unity, each occurring with multiplicity $d$.

Substituting $X= t^{-m}$ yields the original result.


> Special case: set $m=r$, so $d=r$, then the RHS is $r$ copies of 1.

Next up, we want to compare the zeta function for a function field over $\FF_q$ to the zeta function obtained when extending scalars to $\QQ^r$.

:::{.proposition title="?"}
Let $K/\FF_q$ be a function field, $r\in \ZZ^+$, and take the compositum of $K$ and $\FF_q^r$ viewed as a function field over $\FF_q^r$.
Let $Z(t)$ be the zeta function of $K/\FF_q$ and $Z_r(t)$ the zeta function of $K_r/\FF_q^r$.
Then
\[  
Z_r(t^r) = \prod_{q\in \mu_r} Z(qt)
.\]
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}

We have an Euler product formula
\[  
Z(t) = \prod_{p\in \Sigma(K/\FF_q)} (1 - t^{\deg(p)})^{-1} 
.\]
where the sum is over places of the function field.

:::{.exercise title="?"}
Why is this true?
Write as a geometric series with ratio $t^{\deg(p)}$.
Here just expand each summand to get 
\[  
Z(t) = \prod_p \sum_{j=1}^\infty t^{j\deg(p)}
.\]
Multiplying this out and collecting terms is in effect multiplying out the prime divisors to get effective divisors.
:::

We use the result that was stated (but not proved): If $p\in \Sigma_m(K/\FF_q)$ is a degree $n$ place and $r\in \ZZ^+$, then there exist precisely $d\da \gcd(m, r)$places $p^r$ of $K_r$ lying over $p$. 
Moreover, each place $p^r$ has degree $m/d$.

We saw an interesting example of a function field in more than one variable which showed that valuations of rank larger than 1 can arise, but this does not happen for one variable function fields.
That is, for $K/k$ of transcendence degree 1, all valuations on $K$ which are trivial on $k$ are discrete.
We'll now want to go farther and describe the places $\Sigma(K/k)$, which will be the set of points on an algebraic curve.
Scheme-theoretically, this will literally be the set of closed points on a certain projective curve whose function field is $K$.
Note that a priori, finding closed points on a curve over an arbitrary field is hard!

Recall that if $A$ is a Dedekind domain such that $\ff(A) = K$, then for all $\mathfrak{p}\in \mspec(A)$ there exists a discrete valuation $v_p$ on $K$.
I.e., every maximal ideal induces a discrete valuation that is $A\dash$regular, so the valuation ring will contain $A$.
How is this obtained?
Take a nonzero $x\in K\units$, and take the corresponding principal fractional ideal $\gens{x} \da Ax = \prod_{\mathfrak{p} \in \mspec(A)} \mathfrak{p}^{\alpha_{\mathfrak{p}}}$.

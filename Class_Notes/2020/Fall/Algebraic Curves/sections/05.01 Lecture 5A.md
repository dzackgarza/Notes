# Lecture 5A 

We saw an interesting example of a function field in more than one variable which showed that valuations of rank larger than 1 can arise, but this does not happen for one variable function fields.
That is, for $K/k$ of transcendence degree 1, all valuations on $K$ which are trivial on $k$ are discrete.
We'll now want to go farther and describe the places $\Sigma(K/k)$, which will be the set of points on an algebraic curve.
Scheme-theoretically, this will literally be the set of closed points on a certain projective curve whose function field is $K$.
Note that a priori, finding closed points on a curve over an arbitrary field is hard!

Recall that if $A$ is a Dedekind domain such that $\ff(A) = K$, then for all $\mathfrak{p}\in \mspec(A)$ there exists a discrete valuation $v_p$ on $K$.
I.e., every maximal ideal induces a discrete valuation that is $A\dash$regular, so the valuation ring will contain $A$.
How is this obtained?
Take a nonzero $x\in K\units$, and take the corresponding principal fractional ideal $\gens{x} \da Ax$, which we can factor in a Dedekind domain as $Ax = \prod_{\mathfrak{p} \in \mspec(A)} \mathfrak{p}^{\alpha_{\mathfrak{p}}}$ with $\alpha_{\mathfrak{p}} \in \ZZ$.
This looks like an infinite product, but for any fixed $x$, only finitely many $\alpha$ are nonzero.
Note that these $\alpha$ are exactly what we're looking for: the $\mathfrak{p}\dash$adic evaluation of $x$ is given precisely by $v_{\mathfrak{p}}(x) \da \alpha_{\mathfrak{p}}$, where we are using unique factorization of ideals in Dedekind domains.
Thus we have a map
\[  
v_{\wait}: \mspec(A) &\to \Sigma(K/A) \\
\mathfrak{p} &\mapsto v_{\mathfrak{p}}
.\]

So this sends a maximal ideal to a place that is $A\dash$regular, and it turns out to be a bijection.

:::{.proposition title="?"}
The map $v$ is a bijection, and thus we may write
\[  
\Sigma(K/A) \cong \mspec(A)
.\]

$v$ is injective.

If $\mathfrak{p}_1, \mathfrak{p}_2 \in \mspec(A)$ are two different maximal ideals.
Then there exists an element $x\in \mathfrak{p}_1 \sm \mathfrak{p}_2$, and so $x^{-1} \in A_{\mathfrak{p}_2} \sm A_{\mathfrak{p}_1}$.
This follows since if $x$ is not in $\mathfrak{p}_2$, its $\mathfrak{p}_2\dash$adic valuation is zero, and thus the $\mathfrak{p}_2\dash$adic valuation of $x^{-1}$ is $-0 = 0$ as well.
On the other hand, since $x\in \mathfrak{p}_1$, its $\mathfrak{p}_1\dash$adic valuation is positive and therefore $v_{\mathfrak{p}_1}(x^{-1}) < 0$ and $x^{-1}$ is not in $A_{\mathfrak{p}_1}$.

:::{.claim}
$v$ is surjective.

Let $v\in \Sigma(K/A)$, so $A \subset R_v$, i.e. take a valuation whose valuation ring contains $A$.
Note that we're not assuming the valuation is discrete, this can be a general Krull valuation, but we're trying to show it's equal to a certain $p\dash$adic valuation.
As always with a subring of a valuation ring, we can pull back the maximal ideal and consider $\mathfrak{m}_v \intersect A \in \spec(A)$.
We're hoping that this is a maximal ideal, since maximals correspond to valuations.
Since we're in a Dedekind domain, the only prime ideal we *don't* want this to be is the zero ideal of $A$, so suppose it were.
Then $A\nonzero \subset R_v\units$, and so $K\units \subset R_v\units$.
This is because the only element of the maximal ideal that lies in $A$ is zero, so every nonzero element of $A$ is not in this maximal ideal and is thus a unit.
But for any unit, its inverse is also a unit, yielding the inclusion $K\units \subset R_v\units$.
The only way this could possibly happen is if $R_v = K$, which yields the trivial valuation ring.
However, by definition, in $\Sigma(K/A)$ we've excluded the trivial valuation, so this ideal

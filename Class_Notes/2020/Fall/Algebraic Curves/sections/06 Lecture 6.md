# Lecture 6: Affine Domains and Places $\Sigma(K/k)$

The aim of this lecture is to explain the difference (including some technicalities) between $\Sigma(K/k)$ and affine Dedekind domains $R$ such that $K = \ff(R)$.


Recall that

- An **affine domain** over a field $k$ is a domain that is finitely generated as a $k\dash$algebra,

- An **affine Dedekind domain** is an affine domain that is also a Dedekind domain,

- An **affine $k\dash$order** is a one-dimensional affine domain.

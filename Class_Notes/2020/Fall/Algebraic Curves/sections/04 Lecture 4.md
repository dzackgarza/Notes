## One Variable Function Fields (Ch. 1)

Since we have the field-theoretic preliminaries out of the way, we now start studying one-variable function fields in earnest.
The main technique that we use to extract the geometry will be the theory of valuations.
These may be familiar from NTII, but we will cover them in more generality here.

### Valuation Rings and Krull Valuations

Recall that NTII approach to valuations:

:::{.definition title="Valuation"}
A **valuation** on a field $K$ is a map $v:K\to \RR\union \ts\infty$ such that $v(K\units) \subset \RR$, $v(0) = \infty$, and $v$ is of the form $-\log(\abs{\wait})$ where $\abs{\wait}: K \to [0, \infty

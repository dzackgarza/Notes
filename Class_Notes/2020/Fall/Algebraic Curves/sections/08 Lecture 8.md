# Lecture 8: Riemann-Roch Spaces 

Setting up for the single most important theorem in the course: the Riemann-Roch theorem.
We start by motivating this by considering the following property of $K\da k(t)$: for any degree 1[^res_field_reminder]
place $p \in \Sigma(K/k)$, there exists an $f\in K\units$ such that $(f)_- = p$.
In other words, $f$ is a rational function with a simple pole at the given place, and no other poles.
Why?
We just know precisely what all of the places are for this function field.


[^res_field_reminder]: So the residue field of the corresponding DVR is $k$ itself rather than some proper finite degree extension.

If $p= \infty$, we can just take $f(t) = t$, since any polynomial is regular away from $\infty$ and the $1/t\dash$adic
Otherwise, $p

## Base Extension

Given some object $A/k$ and $k\injects \ell$ is a field extension, we would like some extended object $A/\ell$.

:::{.example}
An *affine variety* $V/k$ is given by finitely many polynomials in $p_i \in k[t_1, \cdots, t_n]$, and base extension comes from the map $k[t_1, \cdots, t_n] \injects \ell[t_1, \cdots, t_n]$.

More algebraically, we have the affine coordinate ring over $k$ given by $k[V] = k[t_1,\cdots, t_n]/\gens{p_i}$, the ring of polynomial functions on the zero locus corresponding to this variety.
We can similarly replace $k$ be $\ell$ in this definition.
Here we can observe that $\ell[V] \cong k[V] \tensor_k \ell$.

:::

In general we have a map
\[  
\wait \tensor_k \ell & \\
\ts{k\dash\text{vector space}} &\to \ts{\ell\dash\text{vector spaces}} \\
\ts{k\dash\text{algebras}} &\to\ts{\ell\dash\text{algebras}}
.\]

Note that this will be an exact functor on the category $k\dash\text{Vect}$, i.e. $\ell$ is a flat module.
Here everything is free, and free $\implies$ flat, so things work out nicely.

What about for function fields?

Since $k$ is a $k\dash$algebra, we can consider $k\tensor_k \ell$, however this need not be a field.

> Note: tensor products of fields come up very often, but don't seem to be explicitly covered in classes!
  We'll broach this subject here.

## Base Extension

Given some object $A/k$ and $k\injects \ell$ is a field extension, we would like some extended object $A/\ell$.

:::{.example}
An *affine variety* $A/k$ is given by finitely many polynomials in $k[t_1, \cdots, t_n]$, and base extension comes from the map $k[t_1, \cdots, t_n] \injects \ell[t_1, \cdots, t_n]$.

## Base Extension

Given some object $A/k$ and $k\injects \ell$ is a field extension, we would like some extended object $A/\ell$.

:::{.example}
An *affine variety* $V/k$ is given by finitely many polynomials in $p_i \in k[t_1, \cdots, t_n]$, and base extension comes from the map $k[t_1, \cdots, t_n] \injects \ell[t_1, \cdots, t_n]$.

More algebraically, we have the affine coordinate ring over $k$ given by $k[V] = k[t_1,\cdots, t_n]/\gens{p_i}$, the ring of polynomial functions on the zero locus corresponding to this variety.
We can similarly replace $k$ be $\ell$ in this definition.
Here we can observe that $\ell[V] \cong k[V] \tensor_k \ell$.

:::

In general we have a map
\[  
\wait \tensor_k \ell & \\
\ts{k\dash\text{vector space}} &\to \ts{\ell\dash\text{vector spaces}} \\
\ts{k\dash\text{algebras}} &\to\ts{\ell\dash\text{algebras}}
.\]

Note that this will be an exact functor on the category $k\dash\text{Vect}$, i.e. $\ell$ is a flat module.
Here everything is free, and free $\implies$ flat, so things work out nicely.

What about for function fields?

Since $k$ is a $k\dash$algebra, we can consider $k\tensor_k \ell$, however this need not be a field.

> Note: tensor products of fields come up very often, but don't seem to be explicitly covered in classes!
  We'll broach this subject here.

:::{.exercise}
If $\ell/k$ is algebraic and $\ell\tensor_k \ell$ is a domain, the $\ell = k$.

> I.e. this is rarely a domain.
> Hint: start with the monogenic case, and also reduce to the case where the extension is not just algebraic but finite.

:::

Tensor products of field extensions are still interesting: if $\ell/k$ is finite, it is galois $\iff$ $\ell \tensor_k \ell \cong \ell^{[\ell: k]}$.
So its dimension as an $\ell\dash$algebra is equal to the degree of $\ell/k$, so it splits as a product of copies of $\ell$.

:::{.remark}
We'd like the tensor product of a field to be a field, or at least a domain where we can take the fraction field and get a field.
This hints that we should not be tensoring algebraic extensions, but rather transcendental ones.
:::

:::{.exercise}
For $\ell/k$ a field extension,

a. Show $k(t) \tensor_k \ell$ is a domain with fraction field $\ell(t)$.

b. Show it is a field $\iff$ $\ell/k$ is algebraic.

:::

:::{.proposition title="FT 12.7, 12.8"}
Let $k_1, k_2 / k$ are field extensions, and suppose $k_1 \tensor_k k_2$ is a domain.
Then this is a field $\iff$ at least one of $k_1/k$ or $k_2/k$ is algebraic.
:::

> Reminder: for $\ell/k$ and $\alpha\in \ell$ algebraic over $k$, then $k(\alpha) = k[\alpha]$.

So we'll concentrate on when $K \tensor_k \ell$ is a domain.
What's the condition on a function field $K/k$ that guarantees this, i.e. when extending scalars from $k$ to $\ell$ still yields a domain?
If this remains a domain, we'll take the fraction field and call it the *base change*.

:::{.exercise}
If $K/k$ is finitely generated (i.e. a function field) and $K\tensor_k \ell$ is a domain, then $ff(K\tensor_k \ell)/\ell$ is finitely generated.

> The point: if taking a function field and extending scalars still results in a domain, we'll call the result a function field as well.
:::

Most of all, we want to base change to the algebraic closure.
We'll have issues if the constant field is not just $k$ itself:
:::{.lemma}
If $K\tensor_k \bar k$ is a domain, then the constant field $\kappa(K) = k$.
:::

:::{.proof}
Use the fact that $\wait \tensor_k V$ is exact.
We then get an injection
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\kappa(K) \tensor_k \kappa(K) \ar[rr, hookrightarrow] & &
K \tensor_k \bar k \end{tikzcd} \\
& \kappa(K) \tensor_k \bar k & 
\end{center}
How? 
In two steps:


Now apply the first exercise.

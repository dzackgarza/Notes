:::{.definition title="Affine Variety"}
Let $k=\bar{k}$ be algebraically closed (e.g. $k = \CC, \bar{\FF_p}$).
A variety $V\subseteq k^n$ is an *affine $k\dash$variety* iff $V$ is the zero set of a collection of polynomials in $k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$.

Here $\AA^n\definedas k^n$ with the Zariski topology, so the closed sets are varieties.


:::{.definition title="Affine Algebraic Group"}
An *affine algebraic $k\dash$group* is an affine variety with the structure of a group, where the multiplication and inversion maps 
\[  
\mu: G\cross G &\to G \\
\iota: G&\to G
\]
are continuous.

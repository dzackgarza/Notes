Crelle 1988 (CPS: Cline Parshall Scott)

Let HWC denote a highest weight category

:::{.example}

1. BGG Category $\OO$

2. $\Rat(G)$ for $G$ a reductive algebraic group

3. $\Perv_W(G/B) \cong \OO_0$
:::


See

1. Donkin: On generalized Schur algebras

2. Irving: BGG algebras

There is a equivalence between HWC and QHA (quasi-hereditary algebras).

:::{.remark}
Key Points

1. $L(\lambda) = \soc_G \nabla(\lambda)$ and $\nabla(\lambda) = A(\lambda)$.

2. All composition factors of $\nabla(\lambda)$ satisfy $\mu \leq \lambda$

3. We have cohomological vanishing:
\[
\Ext_G^i(\Delta(\lambda), \nabla(\mu)) = 
\begin{cases}
0 & i >0 \\
0 & i=0, \lambda \neq \mu \\
k & i=0. \lambda = 0
\end{cases}
\]
:::

Interval finite poset: we'll have a cone $\Lambda$ of positive weights:

:::{.theorem title="?"}
Let $G ,G'$ be rational $G\dash$modules admitting good filtrations.
Then the tensor product $V\tensor V'$ also admits a good filtration.

- First proofs: 
  - JP Wong, Type A
  - Donkin, all but characteristic 2 and $E_7, E_8$.
  - O. Mathieu, general proof using algebraic geometry

:::{.example}
Let $G = \SL(n, k)$ and take the natural representation $V = H^0(w_1)$.
Then $V^{\tensor d}$ has a good filtration.
:::

:::{.theorem title="?"}
Let $J\subset \Delta$ be a subset of simple roots.
If $V \in \Mod(G)$ has a good filtration and $L_J$ is a Levi factor, then $V{\downarrow_{L_J}}$ has a good filtration.
:::

:::{.theorem title="?"}
Let $\lieg = \Lie(G)$ and $p$ be a *good prime* (doesn't divide any of the coefficients of the highest weight).
Then the symmetric algebra $S(\lieg)$ has a good filtration.
:::

:::{.remark}
For $p\geq 3(h-1)$, the exterior algebra $\Lambda(\lieg)$ also admits a good filtration.
Question:
Is this true for all primes $p$? Or potentially for all *good* primes $p$?

Let $\ch(k)  p > 0$ and let $G$ be an algebraic group scheme.
We have a Frobenius map  $F:G\to G$ given by $F((x_{ij})) = (x_{ij}^p)$, which we can iterate to get $F^r$ for $r\in \NN$.
Setting $G_r = \ker F^r$ the $r$th Frobenius kernel, we get a normal series of group schemes
\[  
G_1 \normal G_2 \normal \cdots \normal G
.\]

There is an associated chain of finite dimensional Hopf algebras
\[  
\Dist(G_1) \leq \Dist(G_2) \leq \cdots \leq \Dist(G)
.\]

Then $k[G]\dual = \Dist(G_r)$, and we get an equivalence of representations for $G_r$ to representations for $\Dist(G_r)$.

A special case will be when $G$ is a reductive algebraic group scheme.
We'll start by finding a basis for $\Dist(G_r)$.

Recall the PBW theorem: 
\[  
\ts{x_\alpha \st \alpha\in \Phi^+ } \text{ Positive root vectors} \\
.\]

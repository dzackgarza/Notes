From last time: Steinberg's tensor product.

Let $G$ be a reductive algebraic group scheme over $k$ with $\ch(k) > 0$.
We have a Frobenius $F:G\to G$, we iterate to obtain $F^r$ and examine the Frobenius kernels $\ker F^r$.

If we have a representation $\rho: G\to \GL(M)$, we can "twist" by $F^r$ to obtain $\rho^{(r)}: G \to \GL(M^{(r)})$.
We have

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
G \ar[r, "F^r"] & G\ar[r
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

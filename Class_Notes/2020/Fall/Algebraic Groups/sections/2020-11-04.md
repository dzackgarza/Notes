Today: $G_r\dash T$ modules.

Note that $G_r\normal G_r T$, with $G_r T/G_r \cong T^{(r)}$.
We consider $G_r T\dash$modules, which are $G_r\dash$modules with a $T$ action given by
\[  
G_r \cross M &\to M \\
(g, m) &\mapsto g\cdot m
\]
which are $T\dash$equivariant, i.e. $t(g\cdot m) = (t\cdot g)(t\cdot m)$ for $t\in T, g\in G_r$, and $m\in M$ is a $G_r T\dash$module.
This essentially induces a grading on $G_r$.

## Representations for $G_r T$ and $G_r B$

Recall that we have a Frobenius map, for which we take the scheme-theoretic kernel:
\[  
F: G &\to G \qquad F^
.\]

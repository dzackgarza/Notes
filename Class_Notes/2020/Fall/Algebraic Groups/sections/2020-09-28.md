## Kempf's Theorem

Next topic: Kempf's Vanishing Theorem.
Proof in Jantzen's book involving ampleness for sheaves.

Setup:

We have 

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
G & \text{a reductive algebraic group over } k = \bar k \\
B\ar[u, "\subseteq"] & \text{the Borel subgroup} \\
T\ar[u, "\subseteq"] & \text{its maximal torus}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
along with the weights $X(T)$.

We can consider derived functors of induction, yielding $R^n \ind_B^G \lambda = \mathcal{H}^n(G/B, \mathcal{L}(\lambda)) \da H^n(\lambda)$ where $\mathcal{L}(\lambda)$ is a line bundle and $G/B$ is the flag variety.

Recall that 

- $H^0(\lambda) = \ind_B^G(\lambda)$,
- $\lambda \not\in X(T)_+ \implies H^0(\lambda) = 0$
- $\lambda \in X(T)_+ \implies L(\lambda) = \soc_G H^0(\lambda) \neq 0$.

:::{.theorem title="Kempf"}
If $\lambda \in X(T)_+$ a dominant weight, then $H^n(\lambda) = 0$ for $n> 0$.

:::{.remark}
In $\ch(k) = 0$, $H^n(\lambda)$ is known by the Bott-Borel-Weil theorem.
In positive characteristic, this is not know: the characters $\ch H^n (\lambda)$ is known, and it's not even known if or when they vanish.
Wide open problem!

## Good Filtrations and Weyl Filtrations

We define two classes of distinguished modules for $\lambda \in X(T)_+$:

- $\nabla(\lambda) \da H^0(\lambda) = \ind_B^G \lambda$ the costandard/induced modules.
- $\Delta(\lambda) = V(\lambda) \da H^0(-w_0 \lambda) = \ind_B^G \lambda$ the costandard/induced modules.

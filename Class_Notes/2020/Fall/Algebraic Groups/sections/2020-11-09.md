## Strong Linkage

We have two categories:

- $G_r T$, with a notion of *strong linkage*, and 
- $G_r$, which instead only has *linkage*.

We'll restate a few theorems.

:::{.theorem title="?"}
\envlist
Let $\lambda, \mu \in X(T)$.

1. If $[\hat{Z}_r(\lambda) : \hat{L}_r(\mu) ]_{G_r T} \neq 0$, then $\mu \uparrow \lambda$ are strongly linked.

2. If $[{Z}_r(\lambda) : {L}_r(\mu) ]_{G_r} \neq 0$, then $\mu \in W_p \cdot\lambda + p^r X(T)$.

:::{.example title="?"}
In the case of $\Phi = A_2$, we have the following picture

Considering $X_1(T)$ and $[\hat{Z}_1(\lambda) : \hat{L}_1(\mu)] \neq 0$, and $\hat{Z}_1(\lambda)$ has 6 composition factors as $G_1T\dash$modules.

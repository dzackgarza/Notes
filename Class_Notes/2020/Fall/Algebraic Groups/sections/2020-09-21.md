Let $G$ be a reductive algebraic group scheme, $k=\bar \FF_p$ with $p>0$, equipped with the Frobenius map  $F:G\to G$ with $F^r$ its $r\dash$fold composition.
We defined *Frobenius kernels* $G_r \da \ker F^r$, which are in correspondence with the cocommutative Hopf algebras $\Dist(G_r)$.

Goal:
We want to classify simple $G_r\dash$modules, and to do this we'll use socles.

We have a maximal torus $T\subseteq G$ and thus $T_r \subseteq G_r$ after acting by Frobenius.
This yields a SES
\[  
0 \to p_r X(T) \to X(T) \to X(T)/p^r X(T) = X(T_r) \to 0
.\]

How to think about this: take $\lambda \in X(T_r)$, then we can write $

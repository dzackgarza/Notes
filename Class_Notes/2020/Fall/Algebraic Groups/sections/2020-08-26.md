Review:

- $G$ a reductive algebraic group over $k$
- $T = \prod \GG_m$ a maximal split torus
- $\lieg = \lie(G)$
- There's an induced root space decomposition $\lieg = t\oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha\in \Phi}\lieg_\alpha$
- When $G$ is simple, $\Phi$ is an *irreducible* root system
  - There is a classification of these by Dynkin diagrams

:::{.example}
$A_n$ corresponds to $\liesl(n+1, k)$ (mnemonic: $A_1$ corresponds to $\liesl(2)$)
:::

- We have representations $\rho: G\to \GL(V)$, i.e. $V$ is a $G\dash$module

**Important Ideas**:

- Compactness of $\mathcal{L}(x, y)$.
- $\del^2 = 0$.
- Using broken trajectories to compactify
- Gluing


# Background, Notation, Setup

**Goals**

- Construct Floer homology and prove the Arnold Conjecture 

  ("Symplectic Morse Inequalities?"): 
\[  
\# \ts{\text{1-Periodic trajectories of }X_H} \geq \sum_{k\in \ZZ} HM_k(W; \, \ZZ/2\ZZ)
.\]

  > Here $HM_*(W)$ is the Morse homology.

**Strategy**:

1. Define the action functional $\mathcal{A}_H$.

2. Construct the chain complex (graded vector space) $CF_*$.

3. Define $X_H$, which will be used to define $\del$ later. 

4. Count trajectories.

5. Show finite-energy trajectories connect critical points of $\mathcal{A}_H$.

6. Show compactness property for space of trajectories of finite energy.

7. Define $\del$ (uses a compactness property in 9.1c)

8. Show space of trajectories is a manifold (plus genericity, "Smale property")

9. Show that $\del^2 = 0$.

10. Show that $HF_*$ doesn't depend on $\mathcal{A}_H$ or $X_H$

11. Show $HF_* \cong HM_*$, and compare dimensions of the vector spaces $CM_*$ and $CF_*$. 

**Ingredients**:

- $(W, \omega)$ with $\omega \in \Omega^2(W)$ is a symplectic manifold with an almost complex structure $J$.
- $H \in C^\infty(W; \RR)$ a Hamiltonian with $X_H$ the corresponding symplectic gradient.
  - Defined by how it acts on tangent vectors in $T_x M$:
  \[  
  \omega_x(\wait , X_H(x)) = (dH)_x(\wait) 
  .\]
  - Zeros of vector field $X_H$ correspond to critical points of $H$:
  \[  
  X_H(x) = 0 \iff (dH)_x = 0
  .\]
  - Take the associated flow $\psi^t:W\to W$, assumed 1-periodic so $\psi^1(x) = x$: critical points of $H$ are periodic trajectories.
  

- $u \in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; W)$ is a solution to the Floer equation.

- The Floer equation and its linearization:
\begin{align*}
\mcf(u) &= \dd{u}{s} + J \dd{u}{t} + \grad_u(H) = 0 \\
\qty{d\mcf}_u(Y) &= \dd{Y}{s} + J_0 \dd{Y}{t} + S\cdot Y \\ \\ \\
&Y\in u^* TW,~ S \in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; \endo(\RR^{2n}))
.\end{align*}

- $\mcl W$ is the *free loop space* on $W$, i.e. space of contractible loops on $W$, i.e. $C^\infty(S^1; W)$ with the $C^\infty$ topology
  - Elements $x\in \mcl W$ can be viewed as maps $S^1\to W$.
  - Can extend to maps from a closed disc, $u: \bar \DD^2 \to M$.
  - Loops in $\mcl W$ can be viewed as maps $S^2\to W$, since they're maps $I\cross S^1\to W$ with the boundaries pinched:

  ![Loops in $\mcl W$](figures/image_2020-09-20-19-43-22.png)


- The action functional is given by
  \begin{align*}
  \mca_H: \mcl W &\to \RR\\
  x &\mapsto -\int_{\DD} u^* \omega + \int_0^1 H_t(x(t)) ~dt
  \end{align*}

  - Example: $W = \RR^{2n} \implies A_H(x) = \int_0^1 \qty{H_t ~dt - p~dq}$. 
  - Correspondence between trajectories of the gradient of $\mathcal{A}_H$ and solutions to Floer equations.

- $x, y$ periodic orbits of $H$ (nondegenerate, contractible), equivalently critical points of $\mathcal{A}_H$.

- Assumption of *symplectic asphericity*, i.e. the symplectic form is zero on spheres. 
  Statement: for every $u\in C^\infty(S^2, W)$,
\[  
\int_{S^2} u^* \omega = 0 \qtext{or equivalently} \inner{\omega}{\pi_2 W} = 0
.\]

- Assumption of *symplectic trivialization*: for every $u\in C^\infty(S^2; M)$ there exists a symplectic trivialization of the fiber bundle $u^* TM$, equivalently
\[  
\inner{c_1 TW}{\pi_2 W} = 0
.\]
  
  > Locally a product of base and fiber, transition functions are symplectomorphisms.


- Maslov index: used the fact that 
  - $\Sp(2n, \RR)$ retracts onto $U(n)$: use a polar decomposition $S = PQ$ as a PSD times orthogonal, then homotope $P$ to $I$.
  - $\pi_1 U_n = \ZZ$: use $U(n, \CC) \simeq SU(n, \CC)\cross S^1$ by the determinant, and $\pi_1 SU(n, \CC) = 0$.
  - Thus every path in $\gamma: I\to \Sp(2n, \RR)$ can be assigned an integer by getting a map $\tilde \gamma: I \to S^1$ and taking (approximately) its winding number.

- $\mathcal{M}(x, y)$, the moduli space of contractible finite-energy solutions to the Floer equation connecting $x, y$.

  - After perturbing $H$ to get transversality, get a manifold of dimension $\mu(x) - \mu(y)$.

  - How we did it: 
    - Describe as zeros of a section of a vector bundle over $\mathcal{P}^{1, p}(x, y)$ 

      (Banach manifold modeled on the Sobolev spaces $W^{1, p}$), 
    
    - Apply Sard-Smale to show $\mathcal{M}(x, y)$ is the inverse image of a regular value of some map.
  
  - Needed tangent maps to be Fredholm operators, proved in Ch. 8 and used to show transversality.
  
    - Followed from showing $(d\mathcal{F})_u$ is a Fredholm operator of index $\mu(x) - \mu(y)$.



# 9.1 and Review

- Defined moduli space of (parameterized) **solutions**:
\[  
\mathcal{M}(x, y) &= \ts{\text{Contractible finite-energy solutions connecting }x, y } 
\\ \\
\mcm &= \ts{\text{All contractible finite-energy solutions to the Floer equation}}
= \bigcup_{x, y} \mathcal{M}(x, y)
.\]

- Defined the moduli space of (unparameterized) **trajectories** connecting $x$ to $y$:
\[  
\mathcal{L}(x, y) \da \mathcal{M}(x, y) / \RR
.\]

  - Use the quotient topology, define sequentially:
  \[  
  \tilde u_n \converges{n\to\infty}\too \tilde u 
  \quad\iff\quad 
  \exists \ts{s_n}\subset \RR \text{ such that } u_n(s_n + s, \wait) \converges{n\to\infty}\too u(s, \wait)
  .\]

  - When $\abs{\mu(x) - \mu(y)} = 1$, get a compact 0-manifold, so the number of trajectories $$n(x, y) \da \# \mathcal{L}(x, y)$$ is well-defined.

- $C_k(H) \da \ZZ/2\ZZ[S]$ where $S$ is the set of periodic orbits of $X_H$ of Maslov index $k$.

  - Finitely many since they are nondegeneracy implies they are isolated.

\end{center}

:::


- Defined a differential
\[  
\del: C_k(H) &\to C_{k-1}(H) \\
x &\mapsto \sum_{\mu(y) = k-1} n(x, y) y \\ \\
n(x, y) &\da \# \ts{\text{Trajectories of } \grad \mathcal{A}_H \text{ connecting } x, y} \mod 2 \\
&= \# \mathcal{L}(x, y) \mod 2
.\]

- Examined $\del^2$:

\[  
\del^2: C_{k}(H) &\to C_{k-2}(H) \\
x &\mapsto \del(\del(x)) \\
&= \del \qty{\sum_{\mu(y) = \mu(x)-1} n(x, y) y} \\ \\
&= \sum_{\mu(y) = \mu(x) - 1} n(x, y) \del(y) \\ \\
&= \sum_{\mu(y) = \mu(x) - 1} n(x, y) \qty{\sum_{\mu(z) = \mu(y)-1} n(y, z) z} \\ \\
&= \sum_{\mu(y) = \mu(x) - 1} \,\,\sum_{\mu(z) = \mu(y)-1} n(x, y)  n(y, z) \,z \\
&= \sum_{\mu(z) = \mu(y) - 1} \qty{\sum_{\mu(y) = \mu(x)-1} n(x, y)  n(y, z)}\,z \hspace{4em} \text{(finite sums, swap order)}
,\]
  so it suffices to show
\[  
\sum_{\mu(y) = \mu(x)-1} n(x, y)  n(y, z) = 0 \qtext{when} \mu(z) = \mu(x) - 2 
.\]

  > Easier to examine parity, so we'll show it's zero mod 2.


  - When $\mu(z) = \mu(x) - 2$, $\mathcal{L}(x, z)$ is a non-compact 1-manifold, so we compactify by adding in *broken trajectories* to get $\bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, y)$.
  
  - We'll then have
  \[  
  \bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z) = \mathcal{L}(x, z) \union \bd \bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z), \qquad \bd \bar{L}(x, z) = \bigcup_{\mu(y) = \mu(x) - 1} \mathcal{L}(x, y) \cross \mathcal{L}(y, z)
  ,\]
  which "space-ifies" the equation we want.

  - We'll show $\bd \bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)$ is a 1-manifold, which must have an even number of points, and thus
  \[  
  \sum_{\mu(y) = \mu(x)-1} n(x, y)  n(y, z) = 
  \# \qty{\bd \bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)} \equiv 0 \mod 2
  .\]

# Three Important Theorems

## First Theorem: Convergence to Broken Trajectories

- Recall: *broken trajectories* are unions of intermediate trajectories connecting intermediate critical points.

- Shown last time: a sequence of trajectories can converge to a broken trajectory, i.e. there are broken trajectories in the closure of $\mathcal{L}(x, z)$.

- This theorem describes their behavior: 

:::{.theorem title="9.1.7: Convergence to Broken Trajectories"}
Let $\ts{u_n}$ be a sequence in $\mathcal{M}(x, z)$, then there exist
\

- A subsequence $\ts{u_{n_j}}$
\
- Critical points $\ts{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{\ell+1}}$ with $x_0=x$ and $x_{\ell+1} = z$
\
- Sequences $\ts{s_n^1}, \ts{s_n^2}, \cdots, \ts{s_n^\ell}$.
\
- Elements $u^k \in \mathcal{M}(x_k, x_{k+1})$ such that for every $0\leq k \leq \ell$,
\[  
u_{n_j} \cdot s_n^k \converges{n\to\infty}\too u^k
.\]
:::

- Upshots:
  - Every sequence upstairs has a subsequence which (after reparameterizing) converges
  - This descends to actual convergence after quotienting by $\RR$?
  - Yields uniqueness of limits in $\mathcal{L}(x, z)$, thus a separated topology
  - Sequentially compact $\iff$ compact since $\mathcal{L}(x, z)$ is a metric space?

:::{.corollary title="Compactness"}
$\bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)$ is compact.
:::

\newpage

## Second Theorem: Compactness of $\bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)$

:::{.definition title="Regular Pair"}
For an almost complex structure $J$ and a Hamiltonian $H$, the pair $(H, J)$ is **regular** if the Floer map $\mathcal{F}$ is transverse to the zero section in the following vector bundle:
\

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
E_u \da \ts{\text{Vector fields tangent to $M$ along $u$}} \ar[r] & C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; TM)\ar[dd] \\ 
 & \\
 &  C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; M) \ar[uu, bend left, "\mathcal{F}", dotted] \ar[uu, bend right, "\mathbf{0}"', dotted]\\
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

:::


Most of chapter 9 is spent proving this theorem:

:::{.theorem title="9.2.1"}
Let $(H, J)$ be a regular pair with $H$ nondegenerate and $x, z$ be two periodic trajectories of $H$ such that
\[  
\mu(x) = \mu(z) + 2
.\]

Then $\bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)$ is a compact 1-manifold with boundary with
\[  
\bd \bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z) = \bigcup_{y\in \mathcal{I}(x, z)} \mathcal{L}(x ,y) \cross \mathcal{L}(y, z) \qquad\text{where} \quad \mathcal{I}(x, z) = 
\ts{
y \st \mu(x) < \mu(y) < \mu(z)
}
.\]

> Note: possibly a typo in the book? Has $x, y$ on the LHS.
:::

:::{.corollary}
\[\bd^2 = 0.\]
:::

\newpage

## Third Theorem: Gluing

- We already know that $\bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)$ is compact and $\mathcal{L}(x, z)$ is a 1-manifold, so we look at neighborhoods of boundary points.

:::{.theorem title="9.2.3: Gluing"}
Let $x,y,z$ be three critical points of $\mathcal{A}_H$ with three consecutive indices
\[  
\mu(x) = \mu(y)+1 = \mu(z) + 2
.\]

and let 
\[  
(u, v) \in \mathcal{M}(x, y) \cross \mathcal{M}(y, z) \quad\leadsto\quad (\hat u, \hat v)\in \mathcal{L}(x, y) \cross \mathcal{L}(y, z)
.\]

Then

1. There exists a $\rho_0 > 0$ and a differentiable map 
  \[  
  \psi: [\rho_0, \infty) &\to \mathcal{M}(x, z) 
  \]
  such that $\hat \psi$, the induced map on the quotient
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
  {[\rho_0, \infty)} \ar[r, "\psi"] \ar[rd, "\hat\psi"', dotted] & \mathcal{M}(x, z)\ar[d, "\pi"] \\
  & \mathcal{L}(x, z) \\
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
    is an embedding that satisfies 
  \[  
  \hat\psi(\rho) \converges{\rho\to\infty}\too (\hat u, \hat v) \in \bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)
  .\]

2. ("Uniqueness") For any sequence $\ts{\ell_n}\subseteq \mathcal{L}(x, z)$,
\[  
\ell_n \converges{n\to\infty}\too (\hat u, \hat v) \quad\implies\quad \ell_n \in \im(\hat \psi) \text{ for } n \gg 0
.\]

# Gluing Theorem 

Broken into three steps:

1. **Pre-gluing**: 
  - Get a function $w_\rho$ which interpolates between $u$ and $v$ in the parameter $\rho$.

    - Not exactly a solution itself, just an "approximation". 

2. **Newton's Method**:
  - Apply the Newton-Picard method to $w_p$ to construct a true solution 
  \[  
  \psi: [-\rho, \infty) &\to \mathcal{M}(x, z) \\
  \rho &\mapsto  \oldexp_{w_p}\qty{\gamma(p)}  \\ \\
  \text{for some } \gamma(p) &\in W^{1, p}(w_p^*\, TW) = T_{w_p} \mathcal{P}(x, z)
  \]
  where $\mathcal{P} = ?$.
  

3. **Project and Verify Properties**:

  - Check that the projection $\hat \psi = \pi \circ \psi$ satisfies the conditions from the theorem.


# 9.3: Pre-gluing

- Choose (once and for all) a bump function $\beta$ on $B_{\eps}(0)^c \subset \RR \to [0, 1]$ which is 1 on $\abs{x} \geq 1$ and $0$ on $\abs{x} < \eps$
- Split into positive and negative parts $\beta^\pm(s)$:

![Bump away from zero](figures/image_2020-09-19-02-20-24.png)

- Define an interpolation $w_\rho$ from $u$ to $v$ in the following way:

\begin{equation*}
w_{\rho}(s, t)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
u(s+\rho, t) & \text { if } s \leq-1 \\
\oldexp _{y(t)}\left(\beta^{-}(s) \oldexp _{y(t)}^{-1}(u(s+\rho, t))\right. \left.+\beta^{+}(s) \oldexp _{y(t)}^{-1}(v(s-\rho, t))\right) & \text { if } s \in[-1,1] \\
v(s-\rho, t) & \text { if } s \geq 1
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation*}

- Why does this make sense?
\[  
  \abs{s}\leq 1 \implies u(s\pm \rho, t) \in 
  \ts{\oldexp_{y(t)} Y(t) \st \sup_{t\in S^1} \norm{Y(t)}\leq r_0 } \subseteq \im \oldexp_{y(t)} (\wait)
.\]

- Can make this condition hold if $\rho \gg 0$ since
  \[  
  u(s, t) \converges{s\to\infty}\too y(t) \\
  v(s, t) \converges{s\to-\infty}\too y(t) \\
  .\]

  - So pick a $\rho_0$ such that this holds for $\rho > \rho_0$.

  - Might have to increase $\rho_0$ later, so


# 9.4: Construction of $\psi$.

- Have constructed $w_\rho \in C^\infty_{\searrow}(x, z)C^\infty(x, z)$ for every $\rho \geq \rho_0$, since there is exponential decay.
- Yields $\psi_\rho \in \mathcal{M}(x, z)$ a true solution (to be defined).
- Need to check that $\mathcal{F}(\psi_\rho) = 0$ where 
\[  
\mathcal{F} = \dd{}{s} + J\dd{}{t} + \grad H
x\]
  in the weak sense.

- $\psi_\rho$ already continuous, and by elliptic regularity, makes it a strong solution.

- Trivialization

- Defining $\mathcal{F}_\rho$.

\[  
W^{1, p}\left(\mathbf{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbf{R}^{2 n}\right) &\stackrel{\mathcal{F}_{\rho}}{\longrightarrow} L^{p}\left(\mathbf{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbf{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
\left(y_{1}, \ldots, y_{2 n}\right) &\longmapsto\left[\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial s}+J \frac{\partial}{\partial t}+\operatorname{grad} H_{t}\right)\left(\oldexp _{w_{\rho}} \sum y_{i} Z_{i}^{\rho}\right)\right]_{Z_{i}}
\]
where $\mathcal{F}_\rho \da \mathcal{F} \circ \oldexp_{w_\rho}$ written in the bases $Z_i$.
sd
- Newton-Picard method, general idea

- Original method and variant: find the limit of a sequence
\[  
x_{n+1} = x_n - {f(x_n) \over f'(x_n)}
,\qquad x_{n+1} = x_n - {f(x_n) \over f'({\color{red} x_0} )}
.\]

- Allows finding zeros of $f$ given an approximate zero $x_0$.

- Linearize $\mathcal{F}_\rho$.


- Applying Newton-Picard

  - Decompose $W^{1, p}(\RR\cross S^1; \RR^{2n})$ as $\ker(L_{\rho_n}) \oplus W_{\rho_n}\perp$.

  - Apply Newton-Picard in $W_{\rho_n}\perp$


- Will obtain for every $\rho \geq \rho_0$ an element $\gamma(\rho) \in W_\rho\perp$ with
\[  
\mathcal{F}_\rho(\gamma(\rho)) = 0
.\]

  - Apply the implicit function theorem to show differentiability of $\gamma$ in $\rho$.

  - Use a trivialization $Z_i^\rho$ to get a vector field along $w_\rho$ (also called $\gamma(\rho)$)

    - This is exactly an element of $T_{w_\rho}\mathcal{P}(x, z)$

  - Exponentiate to get an element of $\mathcal{M}(x, z)$:

  \[  
  \psi(\rho) \da \oldexp_{w_\rho}\qty{\gamma(\rho)}
  .\]

  - Project onto $\mathcal{L}(x, z)$ to get $\hat \psi$.

  - Prove $\hat \psi$ is a proper injective immersion and thus an embedding. 
  - Show that the broken trajectory $(\hat u, \hat v)$ is the endpoint of an embedded interval in $\bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)$.

    - Then show that any other sequence converging to $(\hat u, \hat v)$ must approach via this interval, otherwise could have cuspidal points:


 ![Cuspidal Point on Boundary](figures/image_2020-09-21-04-39-53.png)

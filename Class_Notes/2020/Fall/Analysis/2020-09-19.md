## Notes

- To show a set $X$ is countable, you need a countable set $S$ (e.g. $S = \NN$) an either an injection $X\injects S$ or a surjection $S \surjects X$.
  - Note that any old map won't suffice: the existence of the inclusion map $\QQ \injects \RR$ doesn't show that $\RR$ is countable.
  - To avoid mistakes, it's good to try to explicitly write out the sets and say what the map does to elements. 

- If you say something is an injection/surjection/bijection, it usually warrants a proof (sometimes short).
  Common mistake: describing a map and saying it's a one-to-one correspondence without much or any justification.

- Note that a *countable* union of countable sets is again countable, but not an *arbitrary* union.
  Counterexample: For each $x\in \RR$ define $

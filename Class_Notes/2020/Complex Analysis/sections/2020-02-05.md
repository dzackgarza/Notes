Recall last time:
We have Cauchy's theorem, which says that if $f: \Omega \to \CC$ is holomorphic then $\int_\gamma f~dz = 0$.

We have a partial converse, Morera's theorem: If $g: \Omega \to \CC$ is continuous and $\int_R g~dz = 0$ for every rectangle $R\subset \Omega$ with sides parallel to the axes, then $g$ is holomorphic.

Proof:
Fix a point $a\in\Omega$, then for any $z\in\Omega$ define $f(z) = \int_{\gamma_{a, z}} g(\xi) d\xi = \int_{\sigma_{a, z}} g(\xi) d\xi$.

Then $\dd{f}{z} = \dd{f}{x} = \frac 1 i \dd{f}{y} = g(z)$, making $g$ holomorphic.

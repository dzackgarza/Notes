Recall last time:
We have Cauchy's theorem, which says that if $f: \Omega \to \CC$ is holomorphic then $\int_\gamma f~dz = 0$.

We have a partial converse, Morera's theorem: If $g: \Omega \to \CC$ is continuous and $\int_R g~dz = 0$ for every rectangle $R\subset \Omega$ with sides parallel to the axes, then $g$ is holomorphic.

Recall last time:
We have Cauchy's theorem, which says that if $f: \Omega \to \CC$ is holomorphic then $\int_\gamma f~dz = 0$.

We have a partial converse, Morera's theorem: If $g: \Omega \to \CC$ is continuous and $\int_R g~dz = 0$ for every rectangle $R\subset \Omega$ with sides parallel to the axes, then $g$ is holomorphic.

Proof:
Fix a point $a\in\Omega$, then for any $z\in\Omega$ define $f(z) = \int_{\gamma_{a, z}} g(\xi) d\xi = \int_{\sigma_{a, z}} g(\xi) d\xi$.

Then $\dd{f}{z} = \dd{f}{x} = \frac 1 i \dd{f}{y} = g(z)$, making $g$ holomorphic.

$\qed$

**Theorem (Schwarz Reflection):**
Let $\Omega = \Omega^+ \union L \union \Omega^-$ be a region of the following form:

I.e., $L = \theset{z\in \Omega \suchthat \im z = 0}$, $\Omega^{\pm} = \theset{\pm \im z > 0}$ where $\Omega$ is symmetric about the real axis, i.e. $z\in \Omega \implies \bar z \in \Omega$.

Assume that $f: \Omega^+ \union L \to \CC$ is continuous and holomorphic in $\Omega^+$ and real-valued on $L$.
Define

\begin{align*}
g(z) = 
\begin{cases}
f(z) & z\in \Omega^+ \union L \\
\bar{f(z)} & z\in \Omega^-
\end{cases}
.\end{align*}

Then $g(z)$ is defined and holomorphic on $\Omega$.

Proof:
Check that $g$ satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations

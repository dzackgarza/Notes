Continuing the proof from last time.
Existence involved

- The square root function
- Reciprocal functions
- Automorphisms of the disc

Definition
:   Let $\Omega \subset \CC$ be open.
    A family $\mcf(\Omega)$ of holomorphic functions on $\Omega$ if every sequence has a subsequence that converges uniformly on every compact subset of $\Omega$, where the limit need not be in $\mcf(\Omega)$.

Proving that a family of functions is normal is a consequence of

- Uniform boundedness
- Equicontinuity

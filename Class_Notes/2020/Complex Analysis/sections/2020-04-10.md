Continuing the proof from last time.
Existence involved

- The square root function
- Reciprocal functions
- Automorphisms of the disc

Definition
:   Let $\Omega \subset \CC$ be open.
    A family $\mcf(\Omega)$ of holomorphic functions on $\Omega$ if every sequence has a subsequence that converges uniformly on every compact subset of $\Omega$, where the limit need not be in $\mcf(\Omega)$.

Proving that a family of functions is normal is a consequence of

- Uniform boundedness
- Equicontinuity

Definition
:   A family $\mcf$ is said to be uniformly bounded on compact subset iff for each compact $K \subset \Omega$ there exists $B_K > 0$ such that
    \begin{align*}
    \abs{f(z)} \leq B_k \quad\text{for all} \quad z\in K, f\in\mcf
    .\end{align*}

Definition
:   A family $\mcf$ is equicontinuous if for every $\eps > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ (not depending on the point) such that for all $z, w\in K$,
    \begin{align*}
    \abs{z-w} < \delta \implies \abs{f(z) - f(w)} < \eps \quad\forall f\in\mcf
    .\end{align*}

Continuing the proof from last time.
Existence involved

- The square root function
- Reciprocal functions
- Automorphisms of the disc

Definition
:   Let $\Omega \subset \CC$ be open.
    A family $\mcf(\Omega)$ of holomorphic functions on $\Omega$ if every sequence has a subsequence that converges uniformly on every compact subset of $\Omega$, where the limit need not be in $\mcf(\Omega)$.

Proving that a family of functions is normal is a consequence of

- Uniform boundedness
- Equicontinuity

Definition
:   A family $\mcf$ is said to be uniformly bounded on compact subset iff for each compact $K \subset \Omega$ there exists $B_K > 0$ such that
    \begin{align*}
    \abs{f(z)} \leq B_k \quad\text{for all} \quad z\in K, f\in\mcf
    .\end{align*}

Definition
:   A family $\mcf$ is equicontinuous if for every $\eps > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ (not depending on the point) such that for all $z, w\in K$,
    \begin{align*}
    \abs{z-w} < \delta \implies \abs{f(z) - f(w)} < \eps \quad\forall f\in\mcf
    .\end{align*}

Examples:

1. The family $f_n: I \to \CC$ with $\abs{f_n'} \leq M$ for some fixed constant is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous (by the MVT).
2. The family $f_n(x) \definedas x^n$ for $x\in I$ is uniformly bounded but not equicontinuous since $\lim_{n\to\infty} \abs{f_n(1) - f_n(x_0)} = 1$ for any $x_o \in I^\circ$.

Theorem (Montel)
:   Suppose $\mcf(\Omega)$ is uniformly bounded on compact subsets, then

    1. $\mcf$ is equicontinuous on every compact subset,
    2. $\mcf$ is a normal family.

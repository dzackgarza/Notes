## Chapter 3: Meromorphic Functions and the Logarithm

Let $f(z)$ be holomorphic on $\Omega$, then we have Cauchy's integral formula:

\begin{align*}
f(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_\gamma \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - z} ~d\xi
.\end{align*}

*Example:*
Note that $f(z) = \frac 1 z$ is holomorphic on $\CC\setmins 0$.

Let $\Omega$ be an open set containing a disk $D$ and $\Omega\setminus p$ be a punctured domain.

**Definition:**
We say $f$ has an *isolated singularity* at $p$ iff $f$ is defined and holomorphic on some deleted neighborhood of $p$.

Classification of singularities:

1. Removable: $\abs{f(z)}$ is bounded on some $D_r(p) \setminus p$.

  Example: $f(z) = \sin(z)/z$.

2. Poles: $\lim_{z\to p} \abs{f(z)} = \infty$.
  
  Example: $f_n(z) = \frac{1}{z^n}$ at $p=0$

3. Neither 1 nor 2.

  Example: $f(z) = e^{\frac 1 z}$ at $z=0$.

> Note: for singularities at $\infty$, we can just make the change of variables $z\mapsto \frac 1 z$.

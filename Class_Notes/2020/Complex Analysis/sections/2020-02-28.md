Theorem (Stein)
:   Suppose $f, g$ are holomorphic in $D_r(z_0)$ and $\abs{f(z)} \> \abs{g(z)}$ on $\bd D_r(z_0)$.
    Then $f$ and $f+g$ have the same number of zeros in $D_r(z_0)$.

Proof
: Let $f_t(z) = f(z) + tg(z)$ and use the argument principle.


Theorem (Stein 4.4: Open Mapping)
: If $f$ is holomorphic and nonconstant then $f$ is an open map.

Proof
: Let $w_0 \in \im(f)$ and say $f(z_0) = w_0$.
  We want to show that all $w$ near $w_0$ are also in $\im(f)$.
  Define $g(z) = f(z) - w = f(z) - w_0 + w_0 - w \definedas F(z) + G(z)$.

  Now choose $\delta>0$ such that $D_\delta(z_0) \subset \Omega$ and $f(z) \neq w_0$ on $\bd D_\delta(z_0)$.
  We then select $\delta$ such that $\abs{f(z) - w_0} \geq \eps > 0$ on $\bd D_\delta(z_0)$.
  We have $\abs{F(z)} = \abs{f(z) - w_0} \geq \eps$.
  
  Now choose $w$ such that $\abs{G(z)} = \abs{w-w_0} < \eps$, nothing that $G(z)$ is a constant function (?).
  Then $\abs{F(z)} \geq \eps > \abs{w-w_0} = \abs{G(z)}$.
  So apply Rouche's theorem and conclude that there exists $z\in D_\delta(z_0)$ such that $f(z) = w$.

> Qual alert, some questions related to the Open Mapping Theorem.

Theorem (Stein 4.5: Maximum Modulus)
: If $f$ is holomorphic and nonconstant on $\Omega$, then $\abs{f}$ can not attain a maximum in $\Omega$.

Proof
:   Suppose toward a condraction that $\abs{f}$ attains a maximum in $\Omega$. 
    Since $f$ is holomorphic, it is an open mapping, and therefore if $D_\delta(z_0) \subset \Omega$ then $f(D_\delta(z_0))$ contains a disc.
    Thus there exists a $z\in D_\delta(z_0)$ such that $\abs{f(z)} > \abs{f(z_0)}$.
  
    Conclusion: ?
  
Corollary
: If $\abs{f(z)} = 0$ on $\bd U$ and is nonconstant, then $f$ has a zero in $U$.

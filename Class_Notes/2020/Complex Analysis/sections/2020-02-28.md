Theorem (Stein)
:   Suppose $f, g$ are holomorphic in $D_r(z_0)$ and $\abs{f(z)} \> \abs{g(z)}$ on $\bd D_r(z_0)$.
    Then $f$ and $f+g$ have the same number of zeros in $D_r(z_0)$.

Proof
: Let $f_t(z) = f(z) + tg(z)$ and use the argument principle.


Theorem (Stein 4.4: Open Mapping)
: If $f$ is holomorphic and nonconstant then $f$ is an open map.

Proof
: Let $w_0 \in \im(f)$ and say $f(z_0) = w_0$.
  We want to show that all $w$ near $w_0$ are also in $\im(f)$.
  Define $g(z) = f(z) - w = f(z) - w_0 + w_0 - w \definedas F(z) + G(z)$.

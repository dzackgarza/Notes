Theorem (Stein)
:   Suppose $f, g$ are holomorphic in $D_r(z_0)$ and $\abs{f(z)} \> \abs{g(z)}$ on $\bd D_r(z_0)$.
    Then $f$ and $f+g$ have the same number of zeros in $D_r(z_0)$.

Proof
: Let $f_t(z) = f(z) + tg(z)$ and use the argument principle.


Theorem (Stein 4.4: Open Mapping)
: If $f$ is holomorphic and nonconstant then $f$ is an open map.

Proof
: Let $w_0 \in \im(f)$ and say $f(z_0) = w_0$.
  We want to show that all $w$ near $w_0$ are also in $\im(f)$.
  Define $g(z) = f(z) - w = f(z) - w_0 + w_0 - w \definedas F(z) + G(z)$.

  Now choose $\delta>0$ such that $D_\delta(z_0) \subset \Omega$ and $f(z) \neq w_0$ on $\bd D_\delta(z_0)$.
  We then select $\delta$ such that $\abs{f(z) - w_0} \geq \eps > 0$ on $\bd D_\delta(z_0)$.
  We have $\abs{F(z)} = \abs{f(z) - w_0} \geq \eps$.
  
  Now choose $w$ such that $\abs{G(z)} = \abs{w-w_0} < \eps$, nothing that $G(z)$ is a constant function (?).
  Then $\abs{F(z)} \geq \eps > \abs{w-w_0} = \abs{G(z)}$.
  So apply Rouche's theorem and conclude that there exists $z\in D_\delta(z_0)$ such that $f(z) = w$.

> Qual alert, some questions related to the Open Mapping Theorem.

Theorem (Stein 4.5: Maximum Modulus)
: If $f$ is holomorphic and nonconstant on $\Omega$, then $\abs{f}$ can not attain a maximum in $\Omega$.

Proof
:   Suppose toward a condraction that $\abs{f}$ attains a maximum in $\Omega$, say at $z_0$. 
    Since $f$ is holomorphic, it is an open mapping, and therefore if $D_\delta(z_0) \subset \Omega$ then $f(D_\delta(z_0))$ contains a disc.
    Thus there exists a $z\in D_\delta(z_0)$ such that $\abs{f(z)} > \abs{f(z_0)}$.
    But this contradicts maximality of $f$ at $z_0$.
  
Corollary
:   If $\abs{f(z)} = 0$ on $\bd U$ and is nonconstant, then $f$ has a zero in $U$.

Proof
:   Let $c = \abs{f(z)}$ for $z\in \bd U$.
    Suppose that $f(z)$ has no zeros in $U$.
    Then $g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z)}$ is continuous and holomorphic in $U$.
    Then for all $z_0 \in U$, $\abs{g(z)} = \frac{1}{\abs{f(z)}} = \frac{1}{\abs{f(z_0)}} > \frac 1 c$, since $c = \abs{f(z)}$ for $z\in \bd U$ implies $\abs{f(z_0)} < C$.
    But this contradicts the maximum principle.

> Proof technique: use the fact that the reciprocal is holomorphic.
> Note that this is stronger than $f$ just being smaller in the interior, the modulus actually takes on the smallest value.

## The Complex Logarithm

For $x>0$, we define $\log(x) = \int_1^x \frac 1 t ~dt$, which is the inverse of $e^x$.
For $z\neq 0$, we'd like to define $\log(z) = \log(re^{i\theta}) = \log(r) + i \theta$, but the argument $\theta$ is not uniquely defined.

Theorem
:   Suppose $\Omega$ is simply connected with $1\in \Omega$ and $0\not\in\Omega$.
    Thin in $\Omega$, there is a branch of the logarithm $F(z) = \log_\Omega(z)$ such that

    1. $F(z)$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$.
    2. $e^{F(z)}  = z$ for all $z\in \Omega$
    3. $F(r) = \log(r)$ for all $r>0\in \RR$ near 1.

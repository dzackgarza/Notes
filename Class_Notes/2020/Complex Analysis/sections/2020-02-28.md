Theorem (Stein)
:   Suppose $f, g$ are holomorphic in $D_r(z_0)$ and $\abs{f(z)} \> \abs{g(z)}$ on $\bd D_r(z_0)$.
    Then $f$ and $f+g$ have the same number of zeros in $D_r(z_0)$.

Proof
: Let $f_t(z) = f(z) + tg(z)$ and use the argument principle.


Theorem (Stein 4.4: Open Mapping)
: If $f$ is holomorphic and nonconstant then $f$ is an open map.

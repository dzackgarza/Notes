See Lang's Complex Analysis, there are plenty of solution manuals.

Let $f; \Omega \to \CC$ be a complex-valued function.
Recall that $f$ is *complex differentiable* iff the usual ratio/limit exists.
Note that $h = x+iy$ and $h\to 0 \iff x,y\to 0$.

We can write $f'(z) = \dd{f}{x} = \frac 1 i \dd{f}{y}$.
This follows from Cauchy-Riemann since $u_x = v_y$ and $u_y = -v_x$.

Definition:
We want to define $\del, \bar \del$ operators.
We have the identities

\begin{align*}
x = \frac{z + \bar z}{z} \quad y = \frac{z - \bar z}{iz}
.\end{align*}

We can then write

\begin{align*}
dz = dx + idy \\
d\bar z = dx - i dy
.\end{align*}


We define the dual operators by $\inner{\dd{}{z}}{dz} = 1$ and similarly $\inner{ \dd{}{\bar z}  }{d\bar z} = 1$.

See Lang's Complex Analysis, there are plenty of solution manuals.

Let $f; \Omega \to \CC$ be a complex-valued function.
Recall that $f$ is *complex differentiable* iff the usual ratio/limit exists.
Note that $h = x+iy$ and $h\to 0 \iff x,y\to 0$.

We can write $f'(z) = \dd{f}{x} = \frac 1 i \dd{f}{y}$.
This follows from Cauchy-Riemann since $u_x = v_y$ and $u_y = -v_x$.

**Theorem:**
Suppose $\theset{f_n}\to f$ is a sequence of holomorphic functions converging uniformly on any compact subset $K \subset \Omega$.
Then $f$ is holomorphic.

Proof:
Let $D$ be any disc such that $\bar D \subset \Omega$.
For any rectangle $R \subset D$, we have $\int_R f_n ~dz = 0$.
Since $f_n \to f$ uniformly, $\int_R f ~dz = 0$ and thus $f$ is holomorphic in $D$.

Theorem:
Under the same hypotheses, $f_n' \to f$ uniformly on any compact subset $K \subset \Omega$.

Proof:
See Stein.

Suppose $F(z, s): \Omega \cross [a, b] \to \CC$ and

1. $F(z, s)$ is holomorphic in $z$ for each fixed $s \in [a, b]$.

2. $F(z, s)$ is continuous in $\Omega \cross [a, b]$.

Then $f(z) = \int_a^b F(z, s) ~ds$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$.

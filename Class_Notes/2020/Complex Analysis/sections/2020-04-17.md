Last time: extending a real-analytic function into $\CC$.

Theorem
:   Assume \Omega$ is bounded and $\bd \Omega$ is a finite union of simple closed curves.
    Then the Riemann mappying function $f$ extends to a homeomorphism $\bar f: \bar \Omega \to \bar \DD$.


Proof:
Apply the previous theorem to the real analytic part of $\bd \Omega$, then map these diffeomorphically onto open arcs in $\bd \DD$.

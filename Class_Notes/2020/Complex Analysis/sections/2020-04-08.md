What are the necessary conditions on $\Gamma$ to ensure a conformal map $F$ to $\DD$?

1. $\Omega \neq \CC$, because this would force $F$ to be constant.
2. Since $\DD$ is connected, $\Omega$ must be connected.
3. Since $\DD$ is simply-connected, $\Omega$ must be simply connected.


Theorem
: If $\Omega \subsetneq \CC$ is simply connected and $z_0 \in \Omega$, there exists a unique conformal map $F: \Omega \to \DD$ such that $F(z_0) = 0$ and $F'(z_0) > 0$.

Corollary
: Any two proper simply connected open subsets in $\CC$ are conformally equivalent.

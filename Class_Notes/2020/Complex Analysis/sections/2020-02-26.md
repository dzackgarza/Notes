## Argument Principle and Application

Let $f$ be holomorphic in $\Omega$ which is open, simple, and connected.
Then $f(z_0) = 0$ implies there exists an integer $m$ such that $f(z) = (z-z_0)^m g(z)$ where $g(z_0) \neq 0$.

Let $N_\Omega(f)$ be the number of zeros of $f$ inside $\Omega$, and $N_\Omega(f, a)$ be the number of zeros of $f-a$ in $\Omega$.

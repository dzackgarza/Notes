## Argument Principle and Application

Let $f$ be holomorphic in $\Omega$ which is open, simple, and connected.
Then $f(z_0) = 0$ implies there exists an integer $m$ such that $f(z) = (z-z_0)^m g(z)$ where $g(z_0) \neq 0$.

Let $N_\Omega(f)$ be the number of zeros of $f$ inside $\Omega$, and $N_\Omega(f, a)$ be the number of zeros of $f-a$ in $\Omega$.
Writing $f = f_1 f_2$ where $f_1 = (z-z_0)^m$ and $f_2 = g(z)$, we have

\begin{align*}
\frac f' f 
&= \frac f_1' f_1 + \frac f_2' f_2 \\
&= \frac m {z-z_0} + \frac g' g
.\end{align*}

Now integrating both sides yields

\begin{align*}
\frac 1 {2\pi i } \int_{D_r(z_0)} \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} ~dz = m 
,\end{align*}

so the integral of this function counts the number of zeros of $f$ in $D_r(z_0)$.

Proposition (Argument Principle)
: Let $f$ be holomorphic in a neighborhood of $\bar{D_r(z_0)}$ and suppose that $f$ is non-vanishing on all of $\bd D_r(z_0)$.
  Then

  \begin{align*}
  \frac 1 {2\pi i } \int_{D_r(z_0)} \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} ~dz = N_{D_r(z_0)}(f)
  .\end{align*}

  More generally, if $q(z)$ is another holomorphic function in a neighborhood of $\bar{D_r(z_0)}$ and $z_1, \cdots, z_k$ are the distinct zeros of $f$ in $D_r(z_0)$ with orders $m_1, \cdots, m_k$, then

  \begin{align*}
  \frac 1 {2\pi i } \int_{D_r(z_0)} q(z) \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} ~dz
  = \sum_{j=1}^k q(z_k) m_k
  .\end{align*}

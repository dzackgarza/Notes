We call $f: U\to V$ biholomorphic if it admits a bijective holomorphic inverse.

Proposition
: If $f: U\to V$ is holomorphic and injective, then $f'(z) \neq 0$, $f$ is biholomorphic onto its image, and thus the inverse of a conformal map is also holomorphic.

Proof
:   We argue by contradiction and suppose $f'(z_0) =0$ for some $z_0 \in U$.
    Then $f(z) - f(z_0) = a(z-z_0)^k + G(z)$ for all $z$ near $z_0$,
    with $a\neq 0, k > 2$, and $G$ v anishing to order $k+1$ at $z_0$.

We call $f: U\to V$ biholomorphic if it admits a bijective holomorphic inverse.

Proposition
: If $f: U\to V$ is holomorphic and injective, then $f'(z) \neq 0$, $f$ is biholomorphic onto its image, and thus the inverse of a conformal map is also holomorphic.

Proof
:   We argue by contradiction and suppose $f'(z_0) =0$ for some $z_0 \in U$.
    Then $f(z) - f(z_0) = a(z-z_0)^k + G(z)$ for all $z$ near $z_0$,
    with $a\neq 0, k \geq 2$, and $G$ v anishing to order $k+1$ at $z_0$.
    For $w$ small enough, we write $f(z) - f(z_0) - w = F(z) + G(z)$ where $F(z) = a(z-z_0)^k - w$.

    Since $\abs G < \abs F$ on the boundary of a small disc $D_\eps(z_0)$ and $F$ has at least two zeros in $D_\eps(z_0)$, Rouche's theorem implies that $f(z) - f(z_0) - w$ has at least two zeros in this disc.

    Since $f'(z) \neq 0$ for all $z$ in a small punctured neighborhood of $z_0$, it follows that that roots of $f(z) - f(z_0) - w$ are distinct.
    But then $f$ is not injective, a contradiction.

    Now let $g = f\inv$ be the inverse of $f$ on its range, which we can assume is $V$.
    The second part of the proof follows from a Calculus argument, see slides.


Definition
: Two open sets are *conformally equivalent* iff there exist biholomorphic functions composing to the identity.

Recall the Cayley transform $w = F(z) = {i - z \over i + z}$ with inverse $z = G(w) = i {1-w \over 1 + w}$.

Theorem
: The map $F: \HH \to \DD$ is a conformal map with inverse $G$.

Proof (Sketch)
: Use the fact that any point in $\HH$ is closer to $i$ than $-i$.

## Conformal Mappings

The three basic types are translation, dilations, and rotation.

For any $n\in \NN$, the map $z\mapsto z^n$ is conformal in the sector $S = \theset{z \suchthat 0 < \arg(z) < {\pi \over n}}$.
For $0 < \alpha < 2$, the map takes $\HH$ to $\theset{0 < \arg{z} < \alpha\pi}$.

The map $z \mapsto {1 +z \over 1 - z}$ takes the upper half-disc $\DD^+$ to the first quadrant $\HH^+$.

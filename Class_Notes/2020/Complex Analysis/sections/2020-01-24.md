**Corollary:**
If $\gamma$ is a closed curve on $\Omega$ an open set and $f$ is continuous with a primitive in $\Omega$ (i.e. an $F$ holomorphic in $\Omega$ with $F'=f$) then $\int_\gamma f ~dz = 0$.

*Proof (easy):*
\begin{align*}
\int_\gamma f ~dz = \int_\gamma F' = F'(z) z(t) ~dt  = F(z(b)) - F(z(a)) = 0
.\end{align*}

Corollary:
If $f$ is holomorphic with $f'=0$ on $\Omega$, then $f$ is constant.

*Proof (easy):*
Pick $w_0 \in \Omega$; we want to fix $w_0 \in \Omega$ and show $f(w) = f(w_0)$ for all $w\in \Omega$.

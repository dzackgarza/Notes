## Singularities

Recall that there are three types of singularities:

- Removable
- Poles
- Essential

Theorem (3.2)
: An isolated singularity $z_0$ of $f$ is a pole $\iff \lim_{z\to z_0} f(z) = \infty$.

Theorem (3.3, Casorati-Weierstrass)
: If $f$ is holomorphic and has an essential singularity $z_0$, then $f(D_r(\theset{z_0})\setminus \theset{z_0})$ is dense in $\CC$.

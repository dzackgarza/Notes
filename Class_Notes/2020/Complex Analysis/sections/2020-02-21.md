## Singularities

Recall that there are three types of singularities:

- Removable
- Poles
- Essential

Theorem (3.2)
: An isolated singularity $z_0$ of $f$ is a pole $\iff \lim_{z\to z_0} f(z) = \infty$.

Theorem (3.3, Casorati-Weierstrass)
: If $f$ is holomorphic in $D_r(z_0) \setminus \theset{z_0}$ and has an essential singularity $z_0$, then there exists a radius $r$ such that $f(D_r(\theset{z_0})\setminus \theset{z_0})$ is dense in $\CC$.

Proof
:   Proceed by contradiction.
    Suppose there exists a $w\in \CC$ and a $\delta > 0$ such that
    $$
    D_\delta(w) \intersect f(D_r(\theset{z_0})\setminus \theset{z_0}) = \emptyset
    .$$

    If $z \in D_r(w)\setminus{z_0}$, then $\abs{f(z) - w} > \delta$.
    Let $g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z) - w}$; then $\abs{g(z)} < \frac{1}{\delta}$.
    Then $g(z)$ has a removable singularity at $z = z_0$.

    If $g(z_0) \neq 0$, then $f(z) - w$ is holmorphic at $z_0$.
    If not, then $z_0$ is a pole.

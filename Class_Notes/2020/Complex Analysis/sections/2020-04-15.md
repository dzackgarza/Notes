Last time: finished proof of Riemann mapping theorem.
Needed concept of normal families, the rest was computations.


Proposition
:   Suppose $f: \Omega \to \DD$ is a holomorphic diffeomorphism.
    Then $z \to \bd \Omega \implies \abs{f(z)} \to 1$.

Proof
:   For each $\eps > 0$, $\bar D_{1-\eps} = \theset {\abs z < 1- \eps}\subset \DD$ is compact and $K_\eps \definedas f\inv (\bar D_{1-\eps}) \subset \Omega$ is compact by continuity of $f$.
    If $z\not\in K_\eps$, then $\abs{f(z)} > 1-\eps$ by definition.

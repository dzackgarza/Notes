Last time: finished proof of Riemann mapping theorem.
Needed concept of normal families, the rest was computations.


Proposition
:   Suppose $f: \Omega \to \DD$ is a holomorphic diffeomorphism.
    Then $z \to \bd \Omega \implies \abs{f(z)} \to 1$.

Proof
:   For each $\eps > 0$, $\bar D_{1-\eps} = \theset {\abs z < 1- \eps}\subset \DD$ is compact and $K_\eps \definedas f\inv (\bar D_{1-\eps}) \subset \Omega$ is compact by continuity of $f$.
    If $z\not\in K_\eps$, then $\abs{f(z)} > 1-\eps$ by definition.

Definition
: For $I = (a, b) \subset \RR$ an interval, a function $f: I \to \CC$ is real analytic iff for each $x_0 \in I$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that in a $\delta$ neighborhood of $x_0$, $f(x) = \sum a_k(x_0) (x-x_0)^k$ is given by a convergent power series.

In this case, $a_k(x_0)$ is given by the $k$th Taylor coefficient.

Lemma
: For $f$ real analytic, there is a neighborhood $U$ such that ?.

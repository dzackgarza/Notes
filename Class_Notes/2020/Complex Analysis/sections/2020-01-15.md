We'll mostly be working from Simon Vol. 2A, most problems from from Stein's Complex.

## Topology and Algebra of $\CC$

To do analysis, we'll need the following notions:

1. Continuity of a complex-valued function $f: \Omega \to \Omega$
2. Complex-differentiability: For $\Omega \subset \CC$ open and $z_0 \in \Omega$, there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $D_\varepsilon = \theset{z \suchthat \abs{z - z_0} < \varepsilon} \subset \Omega$, and $f$ is holomorphic (complex-differentiable) at $z_0$ iff $\lim{h\to 0} \frac 1 h (f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0))$ exists; if so we denote it by $f'(z_0)$.

Example:
$f(z) = z$ is holomorphic, since $f(z+ h) - f(z) = z+h-z = h$, so $f'(z_0) = \frac h h = 1$ for all $z_0$.

Example:
Given $f(z) = \bar z$, we have $f(z+h)-f(z) = \bar h$, so the ratio is $\frac{\bar h}{h}$ and the limit doesn't exist (?).


We say $f$ is holomorphic on an open set $\Omega$ iff it is holomorphic at every point, and is holomorphic on a closed set $C$ iff there exists an open $\Omega \supset C$ such that $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$.

If $f$ is holomorphic, writing $h = h_1 + ih_2$, then the following two limits exist and are equal:

\begin{align*}
\lim_{h_1 \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + iy_0 + h_1) - f(x_0 + iy_0)}{h_1} = \dd{f}{x}(x_0, y_0) \\
\lim_{h_2 \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + iy_0 + ih_2) - f(x_0 + iy_0)}{ih_2} = \frac 1 i \dd{f}{y}(x_0, y_0) \\
\implies \dd{f}{x} = \frac 1  i \dd{f}{y}
.\end{align*}

So if we write $f(z) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y)$, we have

\begin{align*}
\dd{u}{x} + i \dd{v}{x} \mid_{(x_0, y_0)} = \frac 1 i \qty{
\dd{u}{y} + i \dd{v}{y}
} \mid_{(x_0, y_0)}
,\end{align*}

and equating real and imaginary parts yields the Cauchy-Riemann equations:

\begin{align*}
\dd{u}{x} + i \dd{v}{x} = -i \dd{u}{y} + \dd{v}{y} \\
\iff \dd{u}{x} = \dd{v}{y} \quad\text{and}\quad \dd{u}{y} = - \dd{v}{x}
.\end{align*}

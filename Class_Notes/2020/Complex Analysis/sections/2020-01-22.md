Recall from last time that if $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n$ with $z_0 \neq 0$ has radius of convergence $R = (\limsup \abs{a_n}^{1/n})\inv > 0$, then
$f'$ exists and is obtained by differentiating term-by-term.
We have $f$ analytic implies $f$ holomorphic (and smooth), we want to show the converse.
For this, we need integration.

**Definition:**
A parameterized curve is a function $z(t)$ which maps a closed interval $[a, b] \subset \RR$ to $\CC$.

**Definition:**
The curve is said to be smooth iff $z'$ exists and is continuous on $[a,b]$, and $z'(t) \neq 0$ for any $t$.
At the boundary $\theset{a, b}$, we define the derivative by taking one-sided limits.

**Definition:**
A curve is said to be piecewise smooth iff $z(t)$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and there are $a < a_1 < \cdots < a_n = b$ with $z$ smooth on each $[a_k, a_{k+1}]$.

> Note: may fail to have tangent lines at $a_i$.

**Definition:**
Two parameterizations $z: [a,b] \to \CC, \tilde z: [c, d] \to \CC$ are equivalent iff there exists a $C^1$ bijection $s: [c, d] \to [a, b]$ where $s \mapsto t(s)$ such that $s'>0$ and $\tilde z(s) = z(s(t))$.

Note that $s' > 0$ preserves orientation and $s'<0$ reverses orientation.

**Definition:**

\begin{align*}
\gamma: [a, b] \to \CC \implies \gamma^- \definedas [a,b] to \CC,~~ t \mapsto \gamma(a+b-t)
.\end{align*}

**Definition:**
A curve is closed iff $z(a) = z(b)$, and is simple iff $z(t) \neq z_{t_1}$ for $t\neq t_1$.

**Definition:**
For $C_r(z_0) \definedas \tehset{z\suchthat \abs{z-z_0} = r}$, the positive orientation is given by $z(t) = z_0 + re^{2\pi i t}$ for $t\in [0, 1]$.

**Definition:**
The integral of $f$ over $\gamma$ is defined as

\begin{align*}
\int_\gamma f ~dz = \int_a^b f(z(t)) z'(t)~dt
.\end{align*}

Note: 
This doesn't depend on parameterization, since if $t = t(s)$, then a change of variables yields

\begin{align*}
\int_\gamma f ~dz - \int_c^d f(z(t(s)))z'(t(s))t'(s) ~ds = \int_c^d f(\tilde z(s)) \tilde z'(s) ~ds
.\end{align*}

Definition:
The length of $\gamma$ is defined as $\abs \gamma = \int \abs{z'(t)} ~dt$.

Proposition:
We can extend this definition to piecewise smooth curves by 
$$
\int_\gamma f~dz = \sum \int_{a_k}^{a_{k+1}} f ~dz
$$

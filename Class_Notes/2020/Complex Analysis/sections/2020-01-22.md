Recall from last time that if $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n$ with $z_0 \neq 0$ has radius of convergence $R = (\limsup \abs{a_n}^{1/n})\inv > 0$, then
$f'$ exists and is obtained by differentiating term-by-term.
We have $f$ analytic implies $f$ holomorphic (and smooth), we want to show the converse.
For this, we need integration.

Definition:
A parameterized curve is a function $z(t)$ which maps a closed interval $[a, b] \subset \RR$ to $\CC$.

Definition:
The curve is said to be smooth iff $z'$ exists and is continuous on $[a,b]$, and $z'(t) \neq 0$ for any $t$.
At the boundary $\theset{a, b}$, we define the derivative by taking one-sided limits.

Definition:
A curve is said to be piecewise smooth iff $z(t)$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and there are $a < a_1 < \cdots < a_n = b$ with $z$ smooth on each $[a_k, a_{k+1}]$.

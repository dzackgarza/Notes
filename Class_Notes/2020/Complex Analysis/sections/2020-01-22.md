Recall from last time that if $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n$ with $z_0 \neq 0$ has radius of convergence $R = (\limsup \abs{a_n}^{1/n})\inv > 0$, then
$f'$ exists and is obtained by differentiating term-by-term.
We have $f$ analytic implies $f$ holomorphic (and smooth), we want to show the converse.
For this, we need integration.

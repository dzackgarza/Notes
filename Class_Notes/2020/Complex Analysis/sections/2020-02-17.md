> See Hans Lewy 1957 Annals, Folland and Stein 1973. Does a linear system of PDEs with analytic functions have an analytic solution? What about just $C^\infty$?

Last time:
Laurent series.

We can write a formal series $f(z) = \sum_{n\in \ZZ}a_n (z-a)^n = \sum_{n\geq 0} a_n (z-z_0)^n + \sum{n\leq -1} a_n (z-z_0)^n = A + B$.
Part $A$ converges for $\abs{z-a} < R_1 = \qty{\limsup \abs{x_n}^{1/n}} \inv$.
Part $B$ converges for $\abs{z-a} > R_2 = \limsup \abs{c_{-n}}^{1/n}$.

If $R_1 < R_2$, this does not converge.
Note that if $R_1 > R_2$, then $f$ converges and defines a holomorphic function on the annulus $R_2 < \abs{z-a} < R_1$.
Moreover, $f$ converges uniformly on any compact subset of this annulus, so it can be differentiated term-by-term, and the derivative has the same region of convergence.

Note that if $f$ equals its Laurent expansion, then $c_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} = \frac 1 {2\pi i} \int_\gamma \frac{f(xi)}{\qty{\xi - a}^{n+1}} ~dz$ where $\gamma$ is contained in the annulus of convergence, and $c_{n\leq -1}  0$.

We also have

\begin{align*}
\frac 1 {2\pi i} \int_\gamma f(z)/(z-a)^m ~dz 
&= \sum_{n\in \ZZ} \frac{c_n}{2\pi i} \int_\gamma 1/(z-a)^{m-n} \\
&=c_{m-1}
,\end{align*}

since $\int \frac 1 {z-a}^k = 2\pi i \iff k = 1$ and zero otherwise,
so we have the following formula for the coefficients:


\begin{align}
c_m &= \frac 1 {2\pi i} \int_\gamm \frac{f(z)}{\qty{z-a}^{m+1}}
.\end{align}

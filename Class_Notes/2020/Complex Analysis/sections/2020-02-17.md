> See Hans Lewy 1957 Annals, Folland and Stein 1973. Does a linear system of PDEs with analytic functions have an analytic solution? What about just $C^\infty$?

Last time:
Laurent series.

We can write a formal series $\sum_{n\in \ZZ}a_n (z-a)^n = \sum_{n\geq 0} a_n (z-z_0)^n + \sum{n\leq -1} a_n (z-z_0)^n$.

## Conformal Equivalence

We'll be following Stein, around Chapter 8 currently but skip section 4.
We'll discuss Kobe's proof of the Riemann Mapping Theorem.

Definition
: A bijective holomorphic function $f: U \to V$ is called a *conformal map* or *biholomorphism*.
  Given such a map, we say that $U$ and $V$ are *conformally equivalent* or *biholomorphic*.

Note that this gives an equivalence relation on subsets of $\CC$.

Proposition (1.1)
: If $f: U \to V$ is holomorphic and injective, then for every $z\in U$, $f'(z) \neq 0$.
  In particular, the inverse of $f$ defined on its image is holomorphic, and thus the inverse of a conformal map is holomorphic.

This is not an iff, take $f(z) = z^2$, then $2z\neq 0$ on $\CC\setminus 0$ but $\sqrt{z}$ has two values for every $z$, failing to be injective.

Proof
:   Toward a contradiction, suppose $f'(z_0) = 0$ for some $z_0 \in U$.
    Then since $f$ is holomorphic, we can expand about $z_0$ to obtain
    $$
    f(z) - f(z_0) = a_k(z-z_0)^j + G(z), \quad\quad a_k \neq 0,~k\geq 2
    $$
    for all $z$ near $z_0$, where $G(z)$ vanishes to order $k+1$ at $z_0$.

    For sufficiently small $w$, we write
    $$
    f(z) - f(z_0) - w = F(z) + G(z) \quad\text{where}\quad F(z) = a_k (z-z_0)^k - w
    $$
    Because $\abs{G(z)} < \abs{F(z)}$ on a small disc centered at $z_0$ and $G(z)$ vanishes to order $k+1$ at $z_0$ (where $k> 1$),  we can conclude that $F(z)$ h as at least two distinct zeros inside this disc.
    Applying Rouche's theorem, we conclude that $f(z) - f(z_0) - w$ has at least two zeros as well.
    But this contradicts the injectivity of $f$.

    Now let $g = f\inv$ on the range of $f$, which we can assume is $V$.
    For $w$ close to $w_0$, write $w = f(z)$ and $w_0 = f(z_0)$, yielding

    ????? See notes

Example (Cayley Transform)
: The unit disc and upper half plane are mapped to each other via $F(z) = {i - z \over i + z}$ with inverse $G(w) = i {1 - w \over 1 + w}$.

Theorem (1.2)
: The map $F: \HH \to \DD$ is a conformal map with inverse $D$.

## Conformal Equivalence

We'll be following Stein, around Chapter 8 currently but skip section 4.
We'll discuss Kobe's proof of the Riemann Mapping Theorem.

Definition
: A bijective holomorphic function $f: U \to V$ is called a *conformal map* or *biholomorphism*.
  Given such a map, we say that $U$ and $V$ are *conformally equivalent* or *biholomorphic*.

Note that this gives an equivalence relation on subsets of $\CC$.

Proposition (1.1)
: If $f: U \to V$ is holomorphic and injective, then for every $z\in U$, $f'(z) \neq 0$.
  In particular, the inverse of $f$ defined on its image is holomorphic, and thus the inverse of a conformal map is holomorphic.

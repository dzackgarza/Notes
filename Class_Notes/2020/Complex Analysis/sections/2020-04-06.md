## Automorphisms of the Disc

Lemma (Schwarz)
:   Let $f: \DD \to \DD$ be holomorphic with $f(0) = 0$, then

    1. $\abs{f(z)} \leq \abs{z}$ for all $z\in \DD$.
    2. If for some $z_0 \neq 0$ we have $\abs{f(z_0)} = \abs{z_0}$, then $f$ is a rotation (i.e. $f(z) = e^{i\theta}z$)
    3. $\abs{f'(0)} \leq 1$ and is equality holds, $f$ is a rotation.

Proof
:   \hfill
    1. Expand $f(z) = a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + \cdots$ using $f(0) = 0 \implies a_0 = 0$.
      Then $f(z)/z$ is holomorphic in $\DD$ and bounded in modulus by $1/r$ for $r = \abs{z} < 1$.
      By the maximum modulus principle, this is true for any $\abs{z} < r$, so letting $r\to 1$ yields (1).
    2. Since $\abs{f(z)} < 1$, the modulus of $f(z)/z$ attains its maximum in $\DD^\circ$ and thus is constant.
      So $f(z) = cz$ and at $z_0$ we have $\abs{f(z) / (z-0)} = 1$, so $\abs{c} = 1$ and $f(z)$ is a rotation.
    3. If $g(z) = f(z)/z$ then $\abs{g(z)} < 1$ for all $z\in \DD$ and $g(0) = \lim_{z\to 0} {f(z) f(0) \over z} = f'(0)$.
      If $\abs{f'(0)} = 1$ then $\abs{g(0)} =1$, ???.

We proved that $\aut \DD = \SU(1, 1)$, which preserves a certain Hermitian form and is a non-compact group.

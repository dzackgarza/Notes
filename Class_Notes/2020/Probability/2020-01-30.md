Example 1: 
Binomial Distribution

The state space is $S = \theset{0, 1, \cdots, n}$, and $P(X = i) = {n\choose i} p^j (1-p)^{n-j}$ for $0 < p < 1$.

> Note that flipping a coin once is a Bernoulli distribution, i.e. if $X$ is the number of heads in 1 flip, then $P(X=1) = p,~P(X=0) = 1-p$.

The distribution function is given by $F_X(x) = P(X < x)$ is a step function:

Example 2:
Gaussian (Normal) Distribution

This is given by $P(a < X < b) = \int_a^b \phi(x) ~dx$ where the density $\phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$.

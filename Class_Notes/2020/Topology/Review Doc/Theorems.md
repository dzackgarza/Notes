Theorem:
A metric space $X$ is sequentially compact iff it is complete and totally bounded.

Theorem:
A metric space is totally bounded iff every sequence has a Cauchy subsequence.

Theorem: 
A metric space is compact iff it is complete and totally bounded.

Theorem (Baire):
If $X$ is a complete metric space, then the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense in $X$.

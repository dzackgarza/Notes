Definition:
A space $X$ is connected iff it can not be written as $X = U \disjoint V$ with $U,V$ nonempty, disjoint, and open.

# Problem 19

Prove that the product of two connected spaces is connected.

**Solution:**

Suppose $X\cross Y = U \disjoint V = (U_1 \cross U_2) \disjoint (V_1 \cross V_2)$.
Fix $p \in X$, then $\theset{p} \cross Y U = \subset U_1\cross U_2$ (WLOG) and so $p \in \pi_x(U_1)$.

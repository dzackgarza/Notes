Definition:
A space $X$ is connected iff it can not be written as $X = U \disjoint V$ with $U,V$ nonempty, disjoint, and open.

# Problem 19

Prove that the product of two connected spaces is connected.

**Solution:**

Use the fact that a union of spaces containing a common point is still connected.
Fix a point $(a, b) \in X \cross Y$.
Since the horizontal slice $X_b\definedas X \cross \theset{b}$ is homeomorphic to $X$ which is connected, as are all of the vertical slices $Y_x \definedas \theset{x} \cross Y \cong Y$ (for any $x$), the "T-shaped" space $T_x \definedas X_b \union Y_x$ is connected for each $x$.

Note that $(a, b) \in T_x$ for every $x$, so $\union_{x\in X} T_x = X \cross Y$ is connected.

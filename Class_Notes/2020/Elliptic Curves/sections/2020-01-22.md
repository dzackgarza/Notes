Theorem (Stronger Weak Mordell-Weil:)
Let $n\geq 2$, $k$ a field, $\ch(K)$ not dividing $n$, $E/k$ an elliptic curve $K \definedas K(E[n])$.

Suppose there exists a Dedekind domain $R$ with fraction field $K$ such that

- $\pic R[n]$ is finite
- The cokernel of $x\mapsto nx$ is finite

Then $E(K)/ n E(K)$ is finite.

Exercise:
Take $k = \bar k$, $C/k$ a "nice" affine curve, $R = k[C]$, $K = k(C)$, $\ch(k)$ not dividing $n$.
Show that if $E/k$ is any elliptic curve, then the hypotheses of Stronger Weak Mordell-Weil hold, as does the conclusion, and in fact $E(K)$ need not be finitely generated.

Step 1:
Let $L/K$ be a Galois extension and consider $\iota: E(K)/n E(K) \to E(L)/ n E(L)$.
This is not injective in general, and in fact $\ker(\iota) = (E(K) \intersect nE(L))/ nE(K)$.

Proposition:

a. There exists a map $\ker \iota \to \maps(g_{L/K}, E[n])$, where $g_{L/K}$ is the Galois group of $L/K$.
b. If $L/K$ is finite, then $\ker \iota$ is finite
  
So if $E(L) / nE(L)$ is finite, then $E(K) / nE(K)$ is finite.

Proof:
Let $p\in E(K) \intersect n E(K)$.
Choose $Q_p \in E(L)$ (only determined up to an $n\dash$torsion point) such that $[n] Q_p = p$.
For all $\sigma \in g_{L/K}$ we have 

\begin{align*}
[n] (\sigma(Q_p) - Q_p) = \sigma([n] Q_p) - [n] Q_p = \sigma(p) - p = 0
.\end{align*}

Thus $\sigma(Q_p) - Q_p \in E[n]$.

> Note: this resembles a certain coboundary map in a cohomology theory.

We then associate a map

\begin{align*}
\lambda_p : g_{L/K} \to E[n] \\
\sigma \mapsto \sigma(Q_p) - Q_p
.\end{align*}

Suppose that for $p, p' \in E(K) \intersect n E(L)$, so $\lambda_p = \lambda_{p'}$.
Then for all $\sigma \in g_{L/K}$, we have $\sigma(Q_p - Q_{p'}) = \sigma(Q_p) - Q_p - (\sigma(Q_{p'}) - Q_{p'} ) + (Q_p - Q_{p'})$.

Stronger Weak Mordell-Weil:
Let $n\geq 2$, $k$ a field, $\ch(K)$ not dividing $n$, $E/k$ an elliptic curve $K \definedas K(E[n])$.

Suppose there exists a Dedekind domain $R$ with fraction field $K$ such that

- $\pic R[n]$ is finite
- The cokernel of $x\mapsto nx$ is finite

Then $E(K)/ n E(K)$ is finite.

:
Exercise:
Take $k = \bar k$, $C/k$ a "nice" affine curve, $R = k[C]$, $K = k(C)$, $\ch(k)$ not dividing $n$.
Show that if $E/k$ is any elliptic curve, then the hypotheses of Stronger Weak Mordell-Weil hold, as does the conclusion, and in fact $E(K)$ need not be finitely generated.

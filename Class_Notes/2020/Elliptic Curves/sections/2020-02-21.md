Question: how do we define $h_{V, D}$?

Answer: write $D = D_1 - D_2$ which are (very) ample divisors and basepoint free.
We then obtain embeddings

\begin{align*}
\varphi_1: V &\injects \PP_K^{n_1} \\
\varphi_2: V &\injects \PP_K^{n_2}
.\end{align*}

So write
$$
h_{V, D}(p) = h(\varphi_1(p)) - h(\varphi_2(p)) + O(1)
$$
Example
:   For $E/K$ an elliptic curve,

    - $2[0]$ is an ample divisor
    - $3[0]$ is a very ample divisor.

Let $(K, \abs{\wait})$ be complete and $q\in K\units$ be the Tate parameter with $\abs{q} < 1$.
The *Tate curve* is given in equations by
\begin{align*}
E_q: y^ + xy = x^3 + a_1(q) x + a_2(q)
.\end{align*}

For all $k\geq 1$, we define $S_k(q) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty {n^k q^n \over 1 - q^n}$ for which convergence in $K$ can easily be checked since in the non-Archimedean settings, series converge iff the terms go to zero.

Fact:
\begin{align*}
a_4(q) &= -S_3(q) \\
a_6(q) &= {-5 S_3(q) + 7 S_5(q) \over 12}
.\end{align*}

This is some multiplicative analog of exponentiating the Weierstrass elliptic equations in $\CC\units$.
The discriminant is given as in the theory of modular forms as
\begin{align*}
\Delta (E_q) = q \prod_{n=1}^\infty \qty{1 - q^n}^{?} \neq 0
,\end{align*}

so $E_q$ is an elliptic curve.

The $j\dash$invariant is given by
\begin{align*}
j(E_q) &= {1 \over q} + 744 +  196844q + \cdots \\
& = \frac 1 q \sum_{n=1}^\infty c(n) q^n,\quad c(n) \in \ZZ
.\end{align*}

> Connection to irreducible representations of the Monster group.

Note that $\abs{j(E_q)} = {1 \over \abs q} > 1$ and (claim) the norms of $S_k, a_4, a_q$ are less than 1.

After reducing mod $n$, we obtain $\ts{x\in K \st \abs x < 1}$ and
\begin{align*}
\tilde E_q:  y^2 + xy = x^3
\end{align*}
which becomes singular at $(0, 0)$.

Taking the lowest degree part yields $0 = y^3 + xy = y(y+x)$, meaning we have split multiplicative reduction.
We now want the Tate parameterization.

For $u \in K\units \sm q^z$, define
\begin{align*}
X(u, q) &\definedas \sum_{n\in \ZZ} {q^n u \over \qty{1 - q^n u}^2} - 2S_1(q)
Y(u, q) &\definedas \sum_{n\in \ZZ} {\qty{q^n u}^2 \over \qty{1 - q^n u}^2} - 2S_1(q)
.\end{align*}

> Note the similar formulas involving $g_2, g_3$ in the case of modular forms.

Let $(K, \abs{\wait})$ be complete and $q\in K\units$ be the Tate parameter with $\abs{q} < 1$.
The *Tate curve* is given in equations by
\begin{align*}
E_q: y^ + xy = x^3 + a_1(q) x + a_2(q)
.\end{align*}

For all $k\geq 1$, we define $S_k(q) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty {n^k q^n \over 1 - q^n}$ for which convergence in $K$ can easily be checked since in the non-Archimedean settings, series converge iff the terms go to zero.

Fact:
\begin{align*}
a_4(q) &= -S_3(q) \\
a_6(q) &= {-5 S_3(q) + 7 S_5(q) \over 12}
.\end{align*}

This is some multiplicative analog of exponentiating the Weierstrass elliptic equations in $\CC\units$.
The discriminant is given as in the theory of modular forms as
\begin{align*}
\Delta (E_q) = q \prod_{n=1}^\infty \qty{1 - q^n}^{?} \neq 0
,\end{align*}

so $E_q$ is an elliptic curve

Continuing Clark-Xarles paper on torsion points of abelian varieties $A/k$, where $[k: \QQ_p] = ef$ and $q = p^f$.
If $A/k$ has potentially good reduction, the prime to $p$ torsion injects into the torsion of the residue field, which gave an estimate 
$$
\# A(k)[\tors] 
\leq 
\floor{ \qty{1 + \sqrt q  }^2  }^ g
= 
\floor{ q + 2\sqrt q + 1  }^ g
$$

Can also get a bound on $\# A(k)[p^\infty]$ in terms of $p, g, e$, and if $p \gg e$, the bound is precisely 1.

Continuing Clark-Xarles paper on torsion points of abelian varieties $A/k$, where $[k: \QQ_p] = ef$ and $q = p^f$.
If $A/k$ has potentially good reduction, the prime to $p$ torsion injects into the torsion of the residue field, which gave an estimate 
$$
\# A(k)[\tors]' \text{(prime to $p$)}
\leq 
\floor{ \qty{1 + \sqrt q  }^2  }^ g
= 
\floor{ q + 2\sqrt q + 1  }^ g
$$

Can also get a bound on $\# A(k)[p^\infty]$ in terms of $p, g, e$, and if $p \gg e$, the bound is precisely 1.

We want to generalize this: let $R$ be a valuation ring, then there exists a finite type smooth commutative (not necessarily proper) $R\dash$group scheme $A/R$ with generic fiber $A/k$, the NÃ©ron model, such that $A(R) = A(K)$ and $0 \to A'(R) \to A(R) = A(k) \mapsvia{r} A(\FF_q) \to 0$.
Note that $A'(R)$ here comes from a formal group law.

For $A/\FF_q$ a smooth commutative algebraic group, and $A/k$ has good reduction $\iff A/\FF_q$ is an abelian variety.

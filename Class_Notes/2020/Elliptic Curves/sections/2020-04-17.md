Let $X$ be locally compact and $\Gamma \actson X$ by homeomorphisms.
Recall that $\Gamma$ acts properly discontinuously at $x\in X$ iff there exists a neighborhood $N_x$ such that $\theset{\gamma\in \Gamma \suchthat \gamma\cdot N_x \cdot N_x \neq \emptyset}$ is finite.
Equivalently, th e orbit $\Gamma\cdot x$ is discrete in $X$ and the stabilizer $\Gamma^x$ is finite.
Moreover $\Gamma$ acts freely iff $\Gamma^x$ is trivial for all $x$.

Proposition
: For such $X, \Gamma$ as above, the map $X \to \Gamma/X$ is a galois covering iff $\Gamma$ acts freely and properly discontinuously.

This requires $\Gamma$ to be discrete, otherwise a sequence converging to the identity would have infinitely many neighborhoods converging on a neighborhood of the identity.

A *Fuchsian* group is a discrete subgroup of automorphisms of $\HH \subset \CC$, i.e. $\Gamma \subset \aut_\CC (\HH) = \PSL(2, \RR)$.

Fact
:   Every Fuchsian group acts properly discontinuously on all of $\HH$.
    Thus the discreteness which is necessary is also sufficient in this case.
    Then $\HH \to \Gamma \textbackslash \HH$ is a covering map and the action is free $\iff \Gamma$ has no elements of finite order.

Thus the complex structure (sheaf of holomorphic functions?) pushes forward to the quotient, giving it the structure of a Riemann surface.

Definition
: A *Kleinian* group is a discrete subgroup of $\PSL(2, \CC) = \PGL(2, \CC) = \aut_\CC(\PP^1)$.

Note that $\HH$ carries a hyperbolic structure, and this group precisely preserves it.

Define the regular set as $\ell(\Gamma) = \theset{x\in \PP^1 \suchthat  x \text{ acts freely and PDC}}$

Fact
: A Kleinian group is conjugate in $\PSL(2, \CC)$ to a Fuschian group if it stabilizes a circle in $\PP^1(\CC)$.

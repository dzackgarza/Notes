Let $X$ be locally compact and $\Gamma \actson X$ by homeomorphisms.
Recall that $\Gamma$ acts properly discontinuously at $x\in X$ iff there exists a neighborhood $N_x$ such that $\theset{\gamma\in \Gamma \suchthat \gamma\cdot N_x \cdot N_x \neq \emptyset}$ is finite.
Equivalently, th e orbit $\Gamma\cdot x$ is discrete in $X$ and the stabilizer $\Gamma^x$ is finite.
Moreover $\Gamma$ acts freely iff $\Gamma^x$ is trivial for all $x$.

Proposition
: For such $X, \Gamma$ as above, the map $X \to \Gamma/X$ is a galois covering iff $\Gamma$ acts freely and properly discontinuously.

# Wednesday April 15th: Non-Archimedean Uniformization of Algebraic Curves

See Mumford 1972, or the Springer monograph "? Groups and Mumford Curves" which we'll attempt to summarize today.

Let $(K, \abs{\wait})$ be a complete discretely valued field with valuation ring $R$ and residue field $k$.

Definition
: A *Mumford curve* is a curve $C/R$ that is proper, flat, normal, and nice generic fibers $C/K$ where $C/k$ is semistable  and totally degenerate: each component $u$ is isomorphic to $\PP^1_k$, and the intersections of fibers are only transverse double points.

To such a curve we attach a *dual graph* $G$ with vertices corresponding to components and edges corresponding to intersections between components.
We thus think of the special fiber as combinatorially object.

Today: torsors.

Let $k$ be a (perfect, separable) field and $G/k$ a commutative algebraic group (a finite type reduced group ?).

Definition
:   A variety $X/k$ is a *torsor under $G$* is $\mu: G\cross X \to X$ a group action such that the map

    \begin{align*}
    G\cross X \to X \cross X \\
    (g, x) \mapsto (\mu(gx), x)
    \end{align*}
    is an isomorphism.

For $\ell/k$ any field extension, the base change to $X/\ell$ induces $\mu_\ell$ making $X/\ell$ a $G/\ell$ torsor.
$X$ is trivial iff it is isomorphic to 
\begin{align*}
\mu: G\cross G &\to G \\
(g, hg) &\mapsto gh
.\end{align*}

Claim
: $X$ is trivial iff $X(k) \neq \emptyset$.

First "proof": for $p\in X(k)$, define $\mu(\wait, p): G \to X$.
Want to get a map $G(k\sep) \to X(k\sep)$, when does this happen?
In characteristic zero, we have some map $G\to X$ (???) which is surjective with trivial kernel and thus an isogeny but has not $k\sep$ points.
But this doesn't work in positive characteristic.

Second proof: the map $G\cross X \to X \cross X$ being an isomorphism says that upon base change on $X \to \spec k$, $X$ becomes isomorphic to $G$.
But then it also becomes isomorphic over base change for which $X$ is intermediate.
So if we have
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
T \ar[rr] \ar[rd] & & \spec k \\
& X \ar[ur] &
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
which factors through $Y$, if $p\in X(k)$ then $\spec k\to X$ and thus $X/k \cong G/k$.

The form of the assumed isomorphic implies that the base change of the $G\dash$torsor $X$ from $\spec k$ to $X$ is trivial as a $G\cross X$ torsor over $X$.

$\qed$

For $k$ a field, $G/k$, an equivalent definition would be that a $G$ torsor is $X/k$ with a $G$ action that becomes trivial over $k\sep$.

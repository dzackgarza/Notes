Today: torsors.

Let $k$ be a (perfect, separable) field and $G/k$ a commutative algebraic group (a finite type reduced group ?).

Definition
:   A variety $X/k$ is a *torsor under $G$* is $\mu: G\cross X \to X$ a group action such that the map

    \begin{align*}
    G\cross X \to X \cross X \\
    (g, x) \mapsto (\mu(gx), x)
    \end{align*}
    is an isomorphism.

For $\ell/k$ any field extension, the base change to $X/\ell$ induces $\mu_\ell$ making $X/\ell$ a $G/\ell$ torsor.
$X$ is trivial iff it is isomorphic to 
\begin{align*}
\mu: G\cross G &\to G \\
(g, hg) &\mapsto gh
.\end{align*}

Claim
: $X$ is trivial iff $X(k) \neq \emptyset$.

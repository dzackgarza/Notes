Today: torsors.

Let $k$ be a (perfect, separable) field and $G/k$ a commutative algebraic group (a finite type reduced group ?).

Definition
:   A variety $X/k$ is a *torsor under $G$* is $\mu: G\cross X \to X$ a group action such that the map

    \begin{align*}
    G\cross X \to X \cross X \\
    (g, x) \mapsto (\mu(gx), x)
    \end{align*}
    is an isomorphism.

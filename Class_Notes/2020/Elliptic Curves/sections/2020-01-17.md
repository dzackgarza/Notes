Recall the Height Descent Theorem (see previous notes).
Most important property of height function: the collection of elements under a given height is finite.

> Note that $A/nA$ is the cokernel of multiplication by $n$.

Proof:
Let $r$ be the size of $A/nA$ and choose coset representatives $Q_1, \cdots, Q_r$.
For $P\in G$ (?) define $P_0 = P$ and $P_k$ such that $P_{k-1} = n P_k + Q_i$ for any $i$.

For all positive $k \in \ZZ$, we have $P = n^k P_k + \sum n^j Q_i$.
The claim is that there exists a $c> 0$ such that for all $P \in A$ there exists a $K = K(P)$ such that for all $k\geq K$, $h(P_k) \leq C$.
If this holds, $A$ is generated by $\theset{Q_i} \union h\inv((-\infty, C])$.

Recall the Height Descent Theorem (see previous notes).
Most important property of height function: the collection of elements under a given height is finite.

> Note that $A/nA$ is the cokernel of multiplication by $n$.

Proof:
Let $r$ be the size of $A/nA$ and choose coset representatives $Q_1, \cdots, Q_r$.

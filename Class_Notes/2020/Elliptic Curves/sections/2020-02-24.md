## Classification of Locally $K\dash$Analytic Lie Groups

Let $K$ be a locally compact field with discrete valuation, $R$ a valuation ring with $\mfm = (\pi)$ its maximal ideal where $R/\mfm \cng \FF_q = \FF_{p^a}$.
There are two cases:

- If $\ch K = 0$, then $\QQ_p \subset K$ and $d = [L: \QQ_p]$
- If $\ch K = p > 0$, then $K \cong \FF_q((t))$.

Fact:
Let $G$ be a compact commutative $K\dash$analytic lie group (i.e. locally looks like $k^n$ with transition harts given by convergent power series).

a. There exists a filtration by open subgroups $G = G^0 \supset G^1 \supset \cdots \supset G^n$.

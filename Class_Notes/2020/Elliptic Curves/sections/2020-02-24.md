## Classification of Locally $K\dash$Analytic Lie Groups

Let $K$ be a locally compact field with discrete valuation, $R$ a valuation ring with $\mfm = (\pi)$ its maximal ideal where $R/\mfm \cng \FF_q = \FF_{p^a}$.
There are two cases:

- If $\ch K = 0$, then $\QQ_p \subset K$ and $d = [L: \QQ_p]$
- If $\ch K = p > 0$, then $K \cong \FF_q((t))$.

Fact
:   Let $G$ be a compact commutative $g\dash$dimensional $K\dash$analytic lie group (i.e. locally looks like $k^n$ with transition harts given by convergent power series).

    a. There exists a filtration by open subgroups $G = G^0 \supset G^1 \supset \cdots \supset G^n \supset \cdots$ such that
      0. $G^0/G^i$ is finite and discrete for all $i$, 
      1. $G^i \cong (\mfm^i)^g$, with addition given by a $g\dash$dimensional formal group law,
      2. $\intersect G^i = (0)$, so the filtration is exhaustive,
      3. $G/G^{i+1}$ is $p\dash$torsion,
      4. $G^1[\tors] = G^1[p^\infty]$
    b. If $\ch(K) = 0$, then there exists an open subgroup $U$ of $G$ such that $U \cong (R^g, +)$ as $K\dash$analytic Lie groups.

> Analog in Lie theory: Lie groups with isomorphic Lie algebras yield isomorphic universal covers.
> Can then recover the formal group from the Lie algebra.
> Wildly false in characteristic $p$, since we lose information about the height of the formal group.

Theorem (C-Lacy)
:   a. If $\ch(K) = 0$ (i.e. in a $p\dash$adic field), then $G \cong (R, +)^g \oplus G[\tors]$ as topological groups, where $G[\tors]$ is finite, which is in turn isomorphic to $\ZZ_p^{dg} \oplus G[\tors]$.
    
    b. If $\ch(K) = p$, then there exists a countable set $I$ such that $G \cong \prod_{i\in I} \ZZ_p \oplus G[\tors]$ as topological groups, where each of the groups on the RHS are closed subgroups.
      Moreover, $G[\tors] < \infty \iff G[p] < \infty$, and when these conditions hold, $I$ is infinite.

Remarks:

1. In the category of $G\dash$sets, we have $\aut_{G\dash\text{set}}(G) = G$ where $G$ acts on itself by translation.

2. For $k$ a field, $G/k$ a smooth algebraic group, $X/k$ a variety, $\mu: G\cross X \to X$ is a torsor iff the map
  \begin{align*}
  \phi: G \cross X &\to X\cross X \\
  (g, x) &\mapsto (\mu(g, x), x)
  \end{align*}
    is an isomorphism.
  Letting $G_X \definedas G\cross X, X_X \definedas X\cross X$ be the base changes, this asks for a commuting diagram
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
  G_X \cross_X G_X \ar[r, "\mu_{G_X}"] 
  & G_X \ar[d, "1\cross \phi"] \
  G_X \cross_X X_X \ar[r, "\mu_{X_X}"] 
  & X_X
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  thus the base change to $X$ is the trivial $G\dash$torsor on $X$.


Suppose $G$ is commutative and recall we have a Weil-Chevalley group $WC(k, G)$.
Question:
What is the diff

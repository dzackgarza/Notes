Let $K$ be a field, $n\geq 2$ with $\ch k$ not dividing $n$, and $A/K$ a commutative algebraic group (includes abelian varieties, additive/multiplicative groups, etc).
Assume that $K$ contains all $n$th roots of unity (we showed that this can be assumed).

Let $L \definedas K([n] \inv A(K)) = K(\theset{Q \in A(K\sep) \suchthat [n] Q \in A(K))$.
We've shown that $L/K$ is Galois, and moreover abelian of exponent dividing $n$ and $L/K$ is finite iff $A(K) / n A(K)$ is finite.

> Take $K = \QQ$, then $\QQ[p]$ for every $p$ gives infinite extensions.

We want to show that if $A=E$ is an elliptic curve (or an abelian variety) and $K$ is the fraction field of some Dedekind domain $R$ with some finiteness condition on $\pic(R)$ and $R\units$, then $L/K$ is finite.

Proof (Step 3):

Let $\pr \in \maxspec(R)$ with $\pr$ not dividing $n$ such that $E$ has good reduction at $\pr$.

> Take an $R\dash$integral Weirstrass equation $W/R$ for $E$, then the discriminant satisfies $\Delta(W) \neq 0$.

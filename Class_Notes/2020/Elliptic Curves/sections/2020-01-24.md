Let $K$ be a field, $n\geq 2$ with $\ch k$ not dividing $n$, and $A/K$ a commutative algebraic group (includes abelian varieties, additive/multiplicative groups, etc).
Assume that $K$ contains all $n$th roots of unity (we showed that this can be assumed).

Let $L \definedas K([n] \inv A(K)) = K(\theset{Q \in A(K\sep) \suchthat [n] Q \in A(K))$.

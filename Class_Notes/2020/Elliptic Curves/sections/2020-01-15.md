Recall that we're trying to prove the Mordell-Weil theorem.
Let $K$ be a global field, so it's the field of functions over some nice curve.
Then the Mordell-Weil group $E(K)$ is finitely generated.

Step 1: 
The weak Mordell-Weil theorem for all $n\geq 2$ with $\ch k$ not dividing $n$, $E(k) / n E(k)$ is finite.)

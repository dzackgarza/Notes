Recall that we're trying to prove the Mordell-Weil theorem.
Let $K$ be a global field, so it's the field of functions over some nice curve.
Then the Mordell-Weil group $E(K)$ is finitely generated.

Step 1: 
The weak Mordell-Weil theorem for all $n\geq 2$ with $\ch k$ not dividing $n$, $E(k) / n E(k)$ is finite.

Step 2:
Construction of a height function $h: E(K) \to \RR$ that is "trying" to be a quadratic form.

Step 3 (Today):
The Height Descent Theorem, i.e. if $(A, +)$ is a commutative group such that $A/nA$ is finite for some $n\geq 2$ and it admits a heigh function $h: A\to \RR$, then $A$ is finitely generated.

Question:
What does the weak Mordell-Weil group $E(K)/ nE(K)$ tell use about $E(K)$?

> Note that we'll inject this into a larger group, which we'll show is finite, but this isn't great for learning about the size.

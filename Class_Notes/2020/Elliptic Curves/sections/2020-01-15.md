Recall that we're trying to prove the Mordell-Weil theorem.
Let $K$ be a global field, so it's the field of functions over some nice curve.
Then the Mordell-Weil group $E(K)$ is finitely generated.

Step 1: 
The weak Mordell-Weil theorem for all $n\geq 2$ with $\ch k$ not dividing $n$, $E(k) / n E(k)$ is finite.

Step 2:
Construction of a height function $h: E(K) \to \RR$ that is "trying" to be a quadratic form.

Step 3 (Today):
The Height Descent Theorem, i.e. if $(A, +)$ is a commutative group such that $A/nA$ is finite for some $n\geq 2$ and it admits a heigh function $h: A\to \RR$, then $A$ is finitely generated.

Question:
What does the weak Mordell-Weil group $E(K)/ nE(K)$ tell use about $E(K)$?

> Note that we'll inject this into a larger group, which we'll show is finite, but this isn't great for learning about the size.

Example:
Consider $E/\CC$, then $E(\CC) = S^1 \cross S^1$ and $E(\CC)/nE(\CC) = 0$, so the map $x\to nx$ is a surjective map and $E(K)$ is $n\dash$divisible here.
In general, whenever $K = \bar K$ is algebraically closed, then $x \mapsto nx$ is again surjective and the weak Mordell-Weil group is trivial.
So knowing this is small doesn't tell us much about $E(K)$ at all.

Example:
For $E/\RR$, $E(\RR)$ is either $S^1$ or $S^1 \cross \ZZ/(2)$.)

We'll begin by recalling some properties that Tate curves have.

## Tate Curves

Let $(K, \abs{\wait})$ be a complete nonarchimedean normal field and $q\in K$ with $0 < \abs{q} < 1$.
Then

a. There exists an elliptic curve $E_1/K$ and a $K\dash$analytic group isomorphism
\begin{align*}
\phi_K: K\units/\gens{q} &\mapsvia{\cong} E_q(K)
,\end{align*}
a *multiplicative uniformization*.

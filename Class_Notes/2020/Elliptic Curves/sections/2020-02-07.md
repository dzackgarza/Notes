## Weil Height Machine

What is the analog of the $x\dash$coordinate of an elliptic curve for a general abelian variety?
Answer: an ample base point divisor.

Let $K$ be an NPFF (Northcott Product Formula Field), $V/k$ a projective variety and $\phi: V \to \PP^n$, then define

\begin{align*}
h_\phi: V(K\sep) &\to [0, \infty)
p &\mapsto \log H(\phi(p))
.\end{align*}

*Key property:*
Take hyperplanes $\psi: V \to \PP^m \supset H'$ and $\phi: V\to \PP^n \supset H$, noting that the picard group of $\PP^n$ is $\ZZ$.
Suppose $\phi^* \sim \psi^* H'$, then $h_\phi = h_\psi + O(1)$.
Generally, we'll want to identify functions whose difference is a bounded function.

**Theorem (Weil Height):**
Let $K$ be a NPFF (e.g. a global field) and $V/K$ a smooth projective variety.
There exists a map $h_{V, \wait}: \div V \to \RR^{V(K\sep)}$ from divisors on $V$ to ? which is unique modulo bounded functions such that 

a. For $H \subset \PP^n$ a hyperplane, the divisor $h_{\PP_1^n H} = h + O(1)$ (for the previously defined $h$).

b. Pullbacks: For $\phi: V\to W$ a smooth morphism and $D\in \div W$, we have $h_{V, \phi^* D} = h_{W, D}\circ \phi + O(1)$.

c. Linearity: For all divisors $D_1, D_2 \in \div V$, $h_{V, D_1 + D_2} = h_{V, D_1} + h_{V, D_2} = O(1)$.

d. If $D_1 \sim D_2$, then $h_{V, D_1} = h_{V, D_2} + O(1)$.

e. Positivity: Let $D\subset \div V$ be effective and $B$ the base locus (common intersection of linearly equivalent effective divisors), then$h_{V, D}(p) \geq O(1)$ for all $P \in (V\setminus B)(K\sep)$.

f. Let $D, E \in \div V$ with $D$ ample and $E$ algebraically equivalent to $0$. 
Then $\lim_{P \in V(K\sep), h_{V,D}(p) \to \infty} h_{V, E}(p) / h_{V,D}(p) = 0$.

> Ample: Chern class of line bundle is zero.

g. Finiteness: $D \in \div V$ is ample. For all map into $L/K$ and $r\in \RR$, the set $\theset{p\in V(L) \suchthat h_{V, 0}(p) \leq R  }$ is finite.

Note every ample divisor has the Northcott property.

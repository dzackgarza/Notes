We've been talking about quadratic twists of Tate curves.
Let $K$ be a field, $\ch K \neq 2$, $V/K$ a nice variety, $\iota: \aut(V)$ an involution, $L = K(\sqrt d)/K$, then $J(V, \iota, L) = V^d/K$ is a quadratic twist.
We have $V^d / K(\sqrt d) = V_{K(\sqrt d)}$, and $\Aut K(\sqrt d) / K = \theset{1, \sigma}$ is a two element set, so
\begin{align*}
V^d(K) \definedas \theset{ p \in V(K(\sqrt d)) \suchthat \sigma(p) = \iota(p) }
.\end{align*}

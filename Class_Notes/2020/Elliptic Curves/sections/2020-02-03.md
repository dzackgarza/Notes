We started with a product formula field $(K, \Sigma_K, A)$, then took $L/K$ finite and separable and equipped it with a PFF structure:
$\Sigma_L$ is equal to the places extending $v\in \Sigma_K$, and for $v\in \Sigma_L$, we have $\abs{x}_w = \abs{L_w/K_v (x)  }_v^{1/d}$.

We defined a height function $H: \PP^n(K) \to [1,\infty)$ where $[x_0, \cdots, x_n] \mapsto \prod_{v\in \Sigma_K} \max(\abs{x_0}_v, \cdots)$.

If $L/K$ is separable of degree $d$, we can consider $p\in \PP^n(K) \subset \PP^n(L)$ and define $H_K, H_L$ respectively.
It is then a fact that $H_L(p) = H_K(p)$.
For $\alpha \in \AA^1$, we have $H_L(\alpha) = H_K(N_{L/K}(\alpha))^{1/d} = H_K(\alpha^d)^{1/d} = H(\alpha)$.)}

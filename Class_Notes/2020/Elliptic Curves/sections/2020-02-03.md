We started with a product formula field $(K, \Sigma_K, A)$, then took $L/K$ finite and separable and equipped it with a PFF structure:
$\Sigma_L$ is equal to the places extending $v\in \Sigma_K$, and for $v\in \Sigma_L$, we have $\abs{x}_w = \abs{L_w/K_v (x)  }_v^{1/d}$.

We defined a height function $H: \PP^n(K) \to [1,\infty)$ where $[x_0, \cdots, x_n] \mapsto \prod_{v\in \Sigma_K} \max(\abs{x_0}_v, \cdots)$.

If $L/K$ is separable of degree $d$, we can consider $p\in \PP^n(K) \subset \PP^n(L)$ and define $H_K, H_L$ respectively.
It is then a fact that $H_L(p) = H_K(p)$.
For $\alpha \in \AA^1$, we have $H_L(\alpha) = H_K(N_{L/K}(\alpha))^{1/d} = H_K(\alpha^d)^{1/d} = H(\alpha)$.)}

This allows us to extend heigh functions to the separable closure, $H: \PP^n(K\sep) \to \RR$.

**Lemma:**
If $p\in \PP^n(K\sep)$ and $\sigma \in g_K = \aut(K\sep/K)$, then $\sigma(p) \definedas [\sigma(x_0), \cdots, \sigma(x_n)]$ does not change the height.

*Proof:*
Exercise.

> Check that the norms of points are the same as the norms of their Galois conjugates.
> So the height is Galois-equivariant.



For $v\in \Sigma_K$, let $\eps_v$ be the Artin constant: the smallest $\eps_v \in \RR$ such that $\abs{x + y}_v \leq \eps_v \max(\abs{x}_v, \abs{y}_v)$.

> Artin constant: measures how much better a norm does than the triangle inequality.
> Note that $\eps_v = 1$ for ?

Lemma:
Let $K$ be a PFF and $d\in \ZZ^+$.
Then $M(K, d) > 0$ such that for all separable $f(T) = T^d + a_{d-1}T^{d-1} + \cdots a_1 T + a_0 \in K[T]$, i.e. $f(T) = \prod_{i=1}^\alpha (T-\alpha_i)$ with $\alpha_i \in K\sep$, we have $H(a_0, \cdots, a_{n-1}, 1) \leq M(K, d) \prod_{i=1}^d H(\alpha_i)$.

Proof:

Step 1:
Suppose $\alpha_i \in K$ for all $i$.
If so, we can take $M(K, d) = \prod_{v\in \Sigma_K} \eps_v^{d-1}$.

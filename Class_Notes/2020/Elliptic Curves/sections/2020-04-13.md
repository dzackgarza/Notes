## Non-Archimedean Uniformization of Abelian Varieties

We'll start by recalling the Archimedean uniformization theory, i.e. over $\CC$:
every compact connected $\CC\dash$analytic (thus commutative) Lie group is isomorphic to $\CC^g / \Lambda$ a discrete cocompact lattice isomorphic as a $\ZZ\dash$module to $\ZZ^{2g}$.
Note that $\Lambda$ is a complex torus, and not a linear torus $\GG_m^n$.

> Thus all complex torii are isomorphic as topological (even real Lie) groups.

Note that if $(K, \abs{\wait})$ is a complete non-Archimedean field, then full lattices in $k$ do not exist in characteristic zero, so we want a multiplicative version.
The right notion of isomorphism to use here is homothety (scaling by a complex unit) and thus $\Lambda \subset \CC^g$ has an action of $\GL_n(\CC)$ so $\CC^g/\Lambda \cong \CC^g/m \Lambda$, so we may choose $\Lambda$ to have a $\ZZ\dash$basis given by $\lambda_1 = e_1, \lambda_g = c_g$ generalizing the usual basis of $1, \tau$ in the 1-dimensional case.

We have an exponential map $\exp: \CC^g \to (\CC\units)^g$ where $\vector z \mapsto e^{2\pi i \vector z}$, so pushing $\Lambda$ through $\exp$ yields a full lattice $\Lambda' \subset (\CC\units)^g$ where $\CC^g / \Lambda \cong (\CC^\units)^g/\Lambda'$.

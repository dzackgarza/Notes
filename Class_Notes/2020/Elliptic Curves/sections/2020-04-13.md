## Non-Archimedean Uniformization of Abelian Varieties

We'll start by recalling the Archimedean uniformization theory, i.e. over $\CC$:
every compact connected $\CC\dash$analytic (thus commutative) Lie group is isomorphic to $\CC^g / \Lambda$ a discrete cocompact lattice isomorphic as a $\ZZ\dash$module to $\ZZ^{2g}$.
Note that $\Lambda$ is a complex torus, and not a linear torus $\GG_m^n$.

> Thus all complex torii are isomorphic as topological (even real Lie) groups.

Analytic uniformization, beginning of discussion about Tate curves.
Gives us a way to use analysis to understand a variety.

Tate curves: let $(K, \abs{\wait}) = \RR, \CC$ or a complete nonarchimedean field.
Recall that if $K$ is $p\dash$adic, then $(K, +)$ has no nontrivial lattices (closed, discrete subgroups).
For $\CC$ we have an infinite-dimensional covering map $\exp: \CC/\ZZ \mapsvia{z\mapsto e^{2\pi i z}} (\CC\units, \cdot)$ which is an isomorphism of $\CC\dash$lie groups.
If $\tau \in \HH$ and $\Lambda_s = \generators{1, \tau}$, then taking the exponential yields $C/\Lambda_S \mapsvia{\exp} \CC\units/\generators{q_\tau}$ where $q_\tau = e^{2\pi i q}$ and $0 < \abs{q_\tau} < 1$.

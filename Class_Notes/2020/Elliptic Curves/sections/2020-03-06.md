Analytic uniformization, beginning of discussion about Tate curves.
Gives us a way to use analysis to understand a variety.

Tate curves: let $(K, \abs{\wait}) = \RR, \CC$ or a complete nonarchimedean field.
Recall that if $K$ is $p\dash$adic, then $(K, +)$ has no nontrivial lattices (closed, discrete subgroups).

Exercise
:   If $\ch K \neq 2,3$ and $E_1, E_2/ K$ are elliptic curves, set $L = K(\sqrt{d})$.
    If $E_1 \not\cong_K E_2$ but $E_1 \cong_{K(\QQ)} E_2$, then $E_2 \cong E_1^d$ (so $E_2$ is a quadratic twist of $E_1$).

> Note that we take the twist with respect to the inversion map.

This is not generally true for quadratic twists of $(V, \iota)$.
It depends on $\aut(V)$.
If $\aut(E) \theset{\pm 1}$, this holds for $j =  0 ,1728$.
Then for $E/K$ an elliptic curve, $J(E) = \theset{ E'_K \suchthat E' \cong_{K(\sqrt d)} E}$, which is in correspondence with $H^1_{\text{gal}} (\Aut(K(\sqrt d) / K), \aut(E) )$.
This is given by $H^1(\theset{1, \sigma}, I)$, which reduces to a hom set.

Last time we justified the argument that every ramified quadratic twist of a Tate curve, resulting in an elliptic curve with additive reduction.

Question:

Given $E_1, E_2/K$, how we can decide if $E_1 \cong_K E_2$ if $j\neq 0,1728$?

1. Check if they are isomorphic over $\bar K \iff j(E_1) = j(E_2)$.
    If not, stop, otherwise if so, they are quadratic twists of each other.
2. Use an invariant (see Silverman) $\gamma(E)$; then $E_1 \cong E_2 \iff j(E_1) = j(E_2)$ and $\gamma(E_1) = \gamma(E_2)$.

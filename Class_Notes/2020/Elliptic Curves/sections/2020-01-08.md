Summary:

1. Mordell-Weil theorem
  - For elliptic curves over global fields (number fields, function fields, finite fields, etc)
  - Proof uses Galois cohomology and height functions, essentially one proof!
  - Holds for abelian varieties, but more difficult (need an analog of height functions, i.e. an $x\dash$coordinate)
2. Height functions (possibly)
3. Elliptic curves over $\QQ_p$ or complete discrete valuation fields (see Silverman for basics, possibly Chapter 5), particularly Tate curves
4. Weil-Chatelet groups $E/k$ related to $H^1(\k; E)$ with coefficients in the elliptic curve
5. Galois representation of $E/k$ for $\ch k = 0$, for $\rho_n g_k \to \GL(2, \ZZ/n\ZZ)$ which leads to $\hat \rho: g_k \to \GL(\hat \ZZ)$.

# Mordell-Weil Groups

Let $E/k$ be an elliptic curve over a field $k$, i.e. a smooth, projective, geometrically integral curve of genus 1 with a $k\dash$rational point $O$.

> Note: Silverman good for foundations, but assumes $k$ is perfect! 
> Here we'll assume $k$ is arbitrary.

Remark: 
If $k$ is not algebraically closed, such a point $O$ may not exist.

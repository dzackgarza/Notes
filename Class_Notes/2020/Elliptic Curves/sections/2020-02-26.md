Example (regarding generalization from last time)
: Let $G = \prod^\infty \ZZ/p^n\ZZ$, which is a commutative pro-$p$ group.
  Then $\oplus \ZZ_p^n \ZZ \subsetneq G[\tors] \subsetneq G$ with proper containments, but the direct sum is dense in the direct product, so $G[\tors]$ is proper and dense and thus not closed.


## (Clark-Xarles) Local Bounds for Torsion Points on Abelian Varieties

Let $K/\QQ_p$ be a $p\dash$adic field with $[K: \QQ_p] = d$, $R$ a valuation ring, $\mfm$ a maximal ideal, $\FF_q = R/\mfm$.
Let $A/K$ be a $g\dash$dimensional abelian variety and consider $A(K)$.

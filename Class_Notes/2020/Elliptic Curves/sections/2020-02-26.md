Example (regarding generalization from last time)
: Let $G = \prod^\infty \ZZ/p^n\ZZ$, which is a commutative pro-$p$ group.
  Then $\oplus \ZZ_p^n \ZZ \subsetneq G[\tors] \subsetneq G$ with proper containments, but the direct sum is dense in the direct product, so $G[\tors]$ is proper and dense and thus not closed.


## (Clark-Xarles) Local Bounds for Torsion Points on Abelian Varieties

> Recommended reading! Introduces a lot of tools in their most basic form.

Let $K/\QQ_p$ be a $p\dash$adic field with $[K: \QQ_p] = d$, $R$ a valuation ring, $\mfm$ a maximal ideal, $\FF_q = R/\mfm$.

> Recall previously: finiteness on torsion subgroups in certain cases.
> Mordell-Weil works for global fields, but what is that finite group?
> No positive results bounding the torsion for a Laurent series field, can be arbitrary large.


Let $A/K$ be a $g\dash$dimensional abelian variety and recall 

\begin{align*}
A(K) &\cong_{\mathrm{TopGrp}} (R, +)^g \oplus T \cong \ZZ_p^{dg} \oplus T
,\end{align*}
where $\abs{T} < \infty$

We'll prove bounds in three steps:

1. Good reduction
2. Potentially good reduction
3. General reduction and results in the case of *anisotropic reduction*.

$A/K$ has *good reduction* if there exists a smooth group scheme $A?R$ with generic fiber $A/K$.
Noting that $\spec(R) = \theset{(0), (\pi)}$ is a two point space, we have the fibers
\begin{tikzcd}
A \arrow[dd] &  & A/K \arrow[dd] &  & A/\FF_q \arrow[dd] \\
             &  &                &  &                    \\
\spec(R)     &  & (0)            &  & (\pi)             
\end{tikzcd}

We get a SES
$$
0 \to A' \to A(R) \mapsvia{\text{reduction}} A(\FF_q) \to 0
$$
and the fact that it is surjective is due to **Hensel's lemma**.
Here $A' = \mfm^g$ endowed with a formal group law.
Since we have a projective variety, we can clear denominators to replace $A(R)$ with $A(K)$ in the above sequence.
Note that the quotient is precisely a Mordell-Weil group, so using the Weil conjectures, we can say quite a bit about its size.

Thus $A' \injects A(K)$ is an open finite-index subgroup.
Moreover, all of the torsion is $p\dash$primary, and $A'[\tors] = A'[p^\infty]$.
Define $G[\tors]'$ to be the torsion that is prime to $p$.
If the kernel is $p\dash$primary torsion, then the reduction map induces an isomorphism 

\begin{align*}
r: A(K)[\tors]' \mapsvia{\cong} A(\FF_q)
.\end{align*}

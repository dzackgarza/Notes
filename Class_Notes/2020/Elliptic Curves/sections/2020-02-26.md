Example (regarding generalization from last time)
: Let $G = \prod^\infty \ZZ/p^n\ZZ$, which is a commutative pro-$p$ group.
  Then $\oplus \ZZ_p^n \ZZ \subsetneq G[\tors] \subsetneq G$ with proper containments, but the direct sum is dense in the direct product, so $G[\tors]$ is proper and dense and thus not closed.


## (Clark-Xarles) Local Bounds for Torsion Points on Abelian Varieties

> Recommended reading! Introduces a lot of tools in their most basic form.

Let $K/\QQ_p$ be a $p\dash$adic field with $[K: \QQ_p] = d$, $R$ a valuation ring, $\mfm$ a maximal ideal, $\FF_q = R/\mfm$.

> Recall previously: finiteness on torsion subgroups in certain cases.
> Mordell-Weil works for global fields, but what is that finite group?
> No positive results bounding the torsion for a Laurent series field, can be arbitrary large.


Let $A/K$ be a $g\dash$dimensional abelian variety and recall 

\begin{align*}
A(K) &\cong_{\mathrm{TopGrp}} (R, +)^g \oplus T \cong \ZZ_p^{dg} \oplus T
,\end{align*}
where $\abs{T} < \infty$

We'll prove bounds in three steps:

1. Good reduction
2. Potentially good reduction
3. General reduction and results in the case of *anisotropic reduction*.

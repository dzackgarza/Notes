A remark on weak Mordell-Weil:

A profinite group (e.g. group occurring as an absolute Galois group) is *small* if for all $n \in \ZZ^+$, the set of open subgroups of $g$ of index $n$ is finite.

For any $g = g_K = \Aut(K\sep/K)$, $g$ is small iff $K$ has only finitely many separable extensions of any fixed degree $d$.
A field $K$ is *big* iff its Galois group $g_K$ is small.

> Warning: In general not related to cardinality.

If $K$ is big and contains $n$th roots of unity $\mu_n \in K$, then for all $n\geq 2$, the maximal abelian extension of exponent dividing $n$ is finite (by Kummer theory)
Therefore, if $A/K$ is any commutative algebraic group (plus conditions?), then $A(K)/ nA(K)$ is finite.

Fields that are big:

- Finite fields
- Algebraically closed fields
- $\RR$ and any real closed field $\iff$
- $p\dash$adic fields

But $\FF_q((A))$ is *not* big.

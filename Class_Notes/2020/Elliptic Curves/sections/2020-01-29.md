A remark on weak Mordell-Weil:

A profinite group (e.g. group occurring as an absolute Galois group) is *small* if for all $n \in \ZZ^+$, the set of open subgroups of $g$ of index $n$ is finite.

For any $g = g_K = \Aut(K\sep/K)$, $g$ is small iff $K$ has only finitely many separable extensions of any fixed degree $d$.

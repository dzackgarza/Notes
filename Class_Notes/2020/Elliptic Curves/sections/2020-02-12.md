## Correction to Weil's Height Machine

Let $K$ be a NPFF (from now onwards: just a global field) and $X/K$ a nice variety.
Let $D\in \div(X)$ be ample and consider the points of bounded height $\theset{ p\in V(K) \suchthat h(p) \leq R  }$; by the Northcott property this is finite for every $R \in \RR$.

Counterexample:
Let $X = E$ an elliptic curve and $D = [0]$.
Then $\ell(D) = \dim{f\in K(X) \suchthat \div f\geq -D}$, the rational functions with poles no worse than order $D$.
Then $\ell[0] = 1$.

Then there is a corresponding morphism to projective space $\phi_D: X \to \PP(L(D)) = \PP^{\ell(d) - 1}$.
Where $\phi_D: E \to \PP^{\ell[0] - 1} = \PP^0 = \theset{\pt}$.

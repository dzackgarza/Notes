Prove that the transpose map $\tau$ fixes $Z(\lieg)$ pointwise.

> Check that $\tau$ commutes with the Harish-Chandra morphism $\xi$ and use the fact that $\xi$ is injective.

# Humphreys 1.12

Fix a central character $\chi$ and let $\theset{V^{(\lambda)}}$ be a collection of modules in $\OO$ indexed by the weights $\lambda$ for which $\chi = \chi_\lambda$ satisfying

1. $\dim V^{(\lambda)} = 1$
2. $\mu < \lambda$ for all weights $\mu$ of $V^{(\lambda)}$.

Then the symbols $[V^{(\lambda)}]$ form a $\ZZ\dash$basis for the Grothendieck group $K(\OO_x)$.

> For example take $V^{(\lambda)} = M(\lambda)$ or $L(\lambda)$.

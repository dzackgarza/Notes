# Humphreys 3.1
Let $\lieg = \liesl(2, \CC)$ and identify $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$ with a scalar.
Let $N$ be a 2-dimensional $U(\lieb)\dash$module defined by letting $x$ act on $0$ and $h$ act as $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{\lambda} & {1} \\ {0} & {\lambda}\end{array}\right)$.

Show that the induced $U(\lieg)\dash$module structure $M \definedas U(\lieg) \tensor_{U(\lieb)} N$ fits into an exact sequence which fails to split:
$$
0 \to M(\lambda) \to M \to M(\lambda) \to 0
$$

> Hence $M\not\in \OO$.

# Humphreys 3.2

Show that for $M\in \OO$ and $\dim L < \infty$,
$$
(M\tensor L)\dual \cong M\dual \tensor L\dual
$$

# Humphreys 3.4
Show that $\Phi_{[\lambda]} \intersect \Phi^+$ is a positive system in the root system $\Phi_{[\lambda]}$, but the corresponding simple system $\Delta_{[\lambda]}$ may be unrelated to $\Delta$.

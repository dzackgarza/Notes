# Humphreys 3.1
Let $\lieg = \liesl(2, \CC)$ and identify $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$ with a scalar.
Let $N$ be a 2-dimensional $U(\lieb)\dash$module defined by letting $x$ act on $0$ and $h$ act as $\left(\begin{array}{ll}{\lambda} & {1} \\ {0} & {\lambda}\end{array}\right)$.

Show that the induced $U(\lieg)\dash$module structure $M \definedas U(\lieg) \tensor_{U(\lieb)} N$ fits into an exact sequence which fails to split:
$$
0 \to M(\lambda) \to M \to M(\lambda) \to 0
$$

> Hence $M\not\in \OO$.

# Humphreys 3.2

Show that for $M\in \OO$ and $\dim L < \infty$,
$$
(M\tensor L)\dual \cong M\dual \tensor L\dual
$$

# Humphreys 3.4
Show that $\Phi_{[\lambda]} \intersect \Phi^+$ is a positive system in the root system $\Phi_{[\lambda]}$, but the corresponding simple system $\Delta_{[\lambda]}$ may be unrelated to $\Delta$.

> For a concrete example, take $\Phi$ of type $B_2$ with a short simple root $\alpha$ and a long simple root $\beta$.
> If $\lambda \definedas \alpha/2$, check that $\Phi_{[\lambda]}$ contains just the four short roots in $\Phi$.

## a

If a module $M$ has a standard filtration and there exists an epimorphism $\phi: M\to M(\lambda)$, prove that $\ker \phi$ admits a standard filtration.

## b

Show by example that when $\lieg = \liesl(2, \CC)$ that the existence of a monomorphism $\phi: M(\lambda) \to M$ where $M$ has a standard filtration fails to imply that $\coker \phi$ has a standard filtration.

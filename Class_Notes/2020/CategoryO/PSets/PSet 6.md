# Humphreys 5.3

Let $\lambda$ be regular, antidominant, and integral.
In the Jantzen filtration of $M(w\cdot \lambda)$, show that $n = \ell(w)$, where $n$ is the minimal number such that $M(\lambda)^n \neq 0$ but $M(\lambda)^{n+1} = 0$.
Thus there are $\ell(w) + 1$ nonzero layers in this filtration.

> Use 0.3(2) to describe $\Phi^+_{w\cdot \lambda}$.

# Humphreys 7.2

Let $\lieg = \liesl(2, \CC)$ and show that $T_{\lambda}^\mu$ need not take Verma modules to Verma modules.

> For example, let $\lambda = 1$ and $\mu = -3$.

# Exercise p.108

a. Work out the Jantzen filtration sections for $M(w_0 \cdot \lambda)$.
  List carefully any additional assumptions or facts needed to deduce $M(w_0\cdot \lambda)^i$ uniquely.

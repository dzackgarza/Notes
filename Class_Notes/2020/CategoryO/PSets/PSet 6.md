# Humphreys 5.3

Let $\lambda$ be regular, antidominant, and integral, and suppose $M(\lambda)^n \neq 0$ but $M(\lambda)^{n+1} = 0$.
In the Jantzen filtration of $M(w\cdot \lambda)$, show that $n = \ell_\lambda(w)$ where $\ell_\lambda$ is the length function of the system $(W_{[\lambda]}, \Delta_{[\lambda]})$.
Thus there are $\ell(w) + 1$ nonzero layers in this filtration.

> Use 0.3(2) to describe $\Phi^+_{w\cdot \lambda}$.

# Humphreys 7.2

Let $\lieg = \liesl(2, \CC)$ and show that $T_{\lambda}^\mu$ need not take Verma modules to Verma modules.

> For example, let $\lambda = 1$ and $\mu = -3$.

# Exercise p.108

a. Work out the Jantzen filtration sections for $M(w_0 \cdot \lambda)$.
  List carefully any additional assumptions or facts needed to deduce $M(w_0\cdot \lambda)^i$ uniquely.
b. Continue \#4.11 for the case of singular $\lambda$, e.g.  $(\lambda + \rho, \hat \alpha) = 1$.
  If you didn't deduce the structure of all $M(w\cdot \lambda)$ there, can you complete it now?
c. Work out the non-integral case. (There are several different cases to consider.)

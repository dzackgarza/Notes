# Humphreys 5.3

Let $\lambda$ be regular, antidominant, and integral.
In the Jantzen filtration of $M(w\cdot \lambda)$, show that $n = \ell(w)$, where $n$ is the minimal number such that $M(\lambda)^n \neq 0$ but $M(\lambda)^{n+1} = 0$.
Thus there are $\ell(w) + 1$ nonzero layers in this filtration.

> Use 0.3(2) to describe $\Phi^+_{w\cdot \lambda}$.

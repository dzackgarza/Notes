# 1.1

## a

If $M\in \OO$ and $[\lambda] = \lambda + \Lambda_r$ is any coset of $\lieh\dual/\Lambda_r$, let $M^{[\lambda]}$ be the sum of weight spaces $M_\mu$ for which $\mu \in [\lambda]$.
Prove that $M^{[\lambda]}$ is a $U(\lieg)\dash$submodule of $M$ and that $M$ is the direct sum of finitely many such submodules.

## b

Deduce that the weights of an indecomposable module $M\in\OO$ lie in a single coset of $\lieh\dual/\Lambda_r$.

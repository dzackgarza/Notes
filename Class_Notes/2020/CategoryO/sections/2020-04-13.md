Reviewing the definition of *facets*.
We partitioned $\Phi$ into 3 sets $\Phi_F^{0, \pm}$, some of which could be empty.
We had notion of upper and lower closure given by replacing the strict inequalities with inequalities in condition (3) and (2) respectively.

Definition
: If $F$ is a facet with $\Phi_F^0=\emptyset$, then $F$ is called a *chamber*.

A facet with exactly 1 root in $\Phi_F^0$, then this is called a *wall*.

Observations:

1. $\Phi^+ = \Phi_F^+$ always defines a chamber called the *fundamental chamber* and is denoted $C_0$.
2. If $F$ is any chamber, then $F = w\cdot C_0$ for some $w\in W$.

Proposition
:   \hfill
    
    a. Every facet $F$ is the upper closure of some unique chamber $C$.
    b. If $F \subset \hat C$ then $\hat F \subset \hat C$.

Proof
:   \hfill

    a. If $F$ is given by $\Phi_F^0 \union \Phi_F^+ \union \Phi_F^-$ and $C$ pairs with $\Phi_C^+ = \Phi_F^+$ and thus $\Phi_C^- = \Phi_F^- \union \Phi_F^0$.
      To see that $C\neq \emptyset$, use remark (1) on page 132.
    b. Obvious from above description of $C$.

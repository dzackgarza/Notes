Reviewing the definition of *facets*.
We partitioned $\Phi$ into 3 sets $\Phi_F^{0, \pm}$, some of which could be empty.
We had notion of upper and lower closure given by replacing the strict inequalities with inequalities in condition (3) and (2) respectively.

Definition
: If $F$ is a facet with $\Phi_F^0=\emptyset$, then $F$ is called a *chamber*.

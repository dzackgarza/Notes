We get a nonsplit ses
\begin{align*}
0 \to M(xs\cdot \lambda) \to T_\mu^\lambda M(x\cdot \mu) \to M(x\cdot \lambda) \to 0
.\end{align*}

Since $w\vdot \mu$ is the highest weight of $T(w\cdot \mu)$ and occurs with multiplicity one, apply this to all Verma section $M(x\cdot \mu)$, including $x= w$ in a standard filtration of $T(w\cdot \mu)$, thus $T_\mu^\lambda T(w\cdot \mu)$ has highest weight $ws\cdot \lambda$ with multiplicity one.

By Prop 11.1e and Theorem 11.2, $T_\mu%\lambda T(w\cdot \mu) \cong T(ws \cdot \lambda) \oplus T$ where $T$ is a tilting module in $\OO_{\chi_\lambda}$ having all weights less than $ws\cdot \lambda$. 
It suffices to show $T=0$, or equivalently $T_\lambda^\mu T = 0$.

Lemma
: For $\lambda, \mu$ as above and any $M\in \OO_{\chi_\mu}$, $\char T_\lambda^\mu T_\mu^\lambda M = 2 \char M$.

Proof:
By writing $\char M$ in a basis of $M(x\cdot \mu)$ with $x\in W$ and $xs > x$, since $M(xs \cdot \mu) = M(x \cdot \mu)$, it suffices to show this for $M = M(x\cdot \mu)$.
But $T_\lambda^\mu T_\mu^\lambda M(x\cdot \mu)$ is given by applying $T_\lambda^\mu$ to the original SES and we know
$$
T_\lambda^\mu M(xs\cdot \lambda) = M(xs \cdot \mu) = M(x\cdot \mu) = T_\lambda^\mu M(x\cdot \lambda)
$$
Thus $\char T_\lambda^\mu T_\mu^\lambda M(x\cdot \mu) = 2\char M(x\cdot \mu)$.

$\qed$

Now by the lemma, $T_\lambda^\mu T(ws \cdot \lambda) \oplus T_\lambda^\mu T = T_\lambda^\mu T_\mu^\lambda T(w\cdot \mu)$ has formal character $2 \char T(w\cdot \mu)$.
Since it's a tilting module,we must have $T_\lambda^\mu T_\mu^\lambda T(w\cdot \mu) = T(w\cdot \mu) \oplus T(w\cdot \mu)$.
In particular, it has highest weight $w\cdot \mu$.

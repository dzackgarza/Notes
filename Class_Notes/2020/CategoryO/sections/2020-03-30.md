Reminder of what we did already: we started on chapter 4, going into more detail on the strucutre of Verma modules and morphisms between them.
We showed that the socle is an irreducible Verma modules, any nonzero morphism is injective, and the dimension of the hom space is at most 1.
We ended showing a proposition about how to commute elements.

Proposition (Key Result)
:   Let $\lambda, \mu \in \lieh\dual$ and $\alpha\in\Delta$ be simple.
    Assume that $n\definedas (\lambda + \rho, \alpha\dual) \in \ZZ$ and $M(s_\alpha \cdot \mu) \subset M(\mu) \subset M(\lambda)$.
    Then either

    a. $n\leq 0$ and $M(\lambda) \subset M(s_\alpha \cdot \lambda)$, or
    b. $n>0$ and $M(s_\alpha \cdot \mu) \subset M(s_\alpha \cdot \lambda) \subset M(\lambda)$.

    In either case, $M(s_\alpha \cdot \mu) \subset M(s_\alpha \cdot \lambda)$.

Proof (of (a))
: Use proposition 1.4 (exchanging $\lambda$ and $s_\alpha \cdot \lambda$).

## Proof (of (b))

Assume $n>0$.
Then $M(s_\alpha \cdot \lambda) \subset M(\lambda)$ by proposition 1.4.
Set $s = (\mu + \rho, \alpha\dual) \in \ZZ^+$.
Denote maximal vectors as follows:

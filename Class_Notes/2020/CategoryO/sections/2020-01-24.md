A standard theorem about classifying simple modules in category $\OO$:

Theorem:
Every simple module in $\OO$ is isomorphic to $L(\lambda)$ for some $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$, and is determined uniquely up to isomorphism by its highest weight.
Moreover, $\dim \hom_\OO(L(\mu), L(\lambda)) = \delta_{\lambda \mu}$.

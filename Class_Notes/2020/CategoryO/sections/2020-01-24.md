A standard theorem about classifying simple modules in category $\OO$:

Theorem:
Every simple module in $\OO$ is isomorphic to $L(\lambda)$ for some $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$, and is determined uniquely up to isomorphism by its highest weight.
Moreover, $\dim \hom_\OO(L(\mu), L(\lambda)) = \delta_{\lambda \mu}$.


Proof:
Let $L \in \OO$ be irreducible.
As observed in 1.2, $L$ has a maximal vector $v^+$ of some weight $\lambda$.

> Recall: can increase weights and reach a maximal in a finite number of steps.

Since $L$ is irreducible, $L$ is generated by that weight vector, i.e. $L U(\lieg) \cdot v^+$, so $L$ must be a highest weight module.

> Standard argument: use triangular decomposition.

By the universal property, $L$ is a quotient of $M(\lambda)$.
But this means $L \cong L(\lambda)$, the unique irreducible quotient of $M(\lambda)$.

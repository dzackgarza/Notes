Let $M$ 

1. be finitely generated, 
2. semisimple $M = \oplus_{\lambda \in \lieh\dual} M_\lambda$, 
3. locally finite 
4. $\dim M_\mu < \infty$ for all $\mu \in \lieh\dual$,
5. satisfy the forest condition for weights.

**Theorem:**

a. $\mathcal O$ is Noetherian (ascending chain condition on submodules, i.e. no infinite filtrations by submodules)
b. $\mathcal O$ is closed under quotients, submodules, finite direct sums
c. $\mathcal O$ is abelian (similar to a category of modules)
d. If $M\in \mathcal O$, $\dim L < \infty$, then $L \tensor M \in \mathcal O$ and the endofunctor $M \mapsto L\tensor M$ is exact
e. If $M\in \mathcal O$ is locally $Z(\lieg)\dash$finite (recall: this is the center of $U(\lieg)$), i.e. $\dim\spanof Z(\lieg)\cdot v < \infty$ for all $v\in M$.
f. 

*Proofs of a and b:*
See BA II, page 103.

*Proof of c:*
Implied by (b), BA II Page 330.

*Proof of d:*
Can check that $L\tensor M$ satisfies 2 and 3 above.
Need to check first condition.
Take a basis $\theset{v_i}$ for $L$ and $\theset{w_j}$ a finite set of generators for $M$.
The claim is that $B = \theset{v_i \tensor w_j}$ generates $L\tensor M$.
Let $N$ be the submodule generated by $B$.

For any $v\in V$, $v\tensor w_j \in N$.
For arbitrary $x\in \lieg$, compute $x\cdot(v\tensor w_j) = (x\cdot v) \tensor w_j + x\tensor (v\cdot w_j)$.
Since the LHS is in $N$ and the first term on the RHS is in $N$, the entire RHS is in $N$.
By iterating, we find that $v\tensor (u\cdot w_j) \in N$ for all PBW monomials $u$.
So $L\tensor M \in \mathcal O$.


*Proof of e:*
Since $v\in M$is a sum of weight vectors, wlog we can assume $v \in M_\lambda$ is a weight vector (where $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$).
For any central element $z\in Z(\lieg)$, we can compute $h\cdot(z\cdot v) = z \cdot (h\cdot v) = z \cdot \lambda(h) v = \lambda(h)z \cdot v$. 
Thus $z\cdot v\in M_\lambda$.
By (4), we know that $\dim M_\lambda < \infty$, so $\dim \spanof Z(\lieg) \cdot v < \infty$ as well.

*Proof of f:*
By 5, $M$ is generated by a finite dimensional $U(\mathfrak b)$ submodule $N$.

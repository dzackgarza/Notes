Let $M$ 

1. be finitely generated, 
2. semisimple $M = \oplus_{\lambda \in \lieh\dual} M_\lambda$, 
3. locally finite 
4. $\dim M_\mu < \infty$ for all $\mu \in \lieh\dual$,
5. satisfy the forest condition for weights.

Theorem:

a. $\mathcal O$ is Noetherian (ascending chain condition on submodules, i.e. no infinite filtrations by submodules)
b. $\mathcal O$ is closed under quotients, submodules, finite direct sums
c. $\mathcal O$ is abelian (similar to a category of modules)
d. If $M\in \mathcal O$, $\dim L < \infty$, then $L \tensor M \in \mathcal O$ and the endofunctor $M \mapsto L\tensor M$ is exact
e. If $M\in \mathcal O$ is locally $Z(\lieg)\dash$finite (recall: this is the center of $U(\lieg)$), i.e. $\dim\spanof Z(\lieg)\cdot v < \infty$ for all $v\in M$.

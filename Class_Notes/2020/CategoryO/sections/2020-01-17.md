Let $M$ 

1. be finitely generated, 
2. semisimple $M = \oplus_{\lambda \in \lieh\dual} M_\lambda$, 
3. locally finite 
4. $\dim M_\mu < \infty$ for all $\mu \in \lieh\dual$,
5. satisfy the forest condition for weights.

Theorem:

a. $\mathcal O$ is Noetherian (ascending chain condition, i.e. no infinite filtrations)
b. $\mathcal O$ is closed under quotients, finite direct sums

## Infinitesimal Blocks

We'll break up category $\OO$ into smaller subcategories (blocks).

Recall theorem 1.1 (e):
$\mcz(\lieg)$ acts locally finitely on $M\in \OO$, and $M$ has a *finite* filtration with highest weight sections, so $M$ should involve only a finite number of central characters $\chi_\lambda$ (where $\lambda \in\lieh\dual$).

> Note: an analog of Jordan decomposition works here because of this finiteness condition.
> This discussion will parallel the JCF of a simple operator on a finite dimensional $\CC\dash$vector space.

Let $\chi \in \hat \mcz(\lieg)$ and $M\in \OO$.
Let 
$$
M^\chi = \theset{v\in M \suchthat ~\forall z\in \mcz(\lieg),~\exists n>0 \st (z- \chi(z))^n\cdot v = 0$}
$$1

## Infinitesimal Blocks

We'll break up category $\OO$ into smaller subcategories (blocks).

Recall theorem 1.1 (e):
$\mcz(\lieg)$ acts locally finitely on $M\in \OO$, and $M$ has a *finite* filtration with highest weight sections, so $M$ should involve only a finite number of central characters $\chi_\lambda$ (where $\lambda \in\lieh\dual$).

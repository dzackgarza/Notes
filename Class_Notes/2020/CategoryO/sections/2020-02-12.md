## Infinitesimal Blocks

We'll break up category $\OO$ into smaller subcategories (blocks).

Recall theorem 1.1 (e):
$\mcz(\lieg)$ acts locally finitely on $M\in \OO$, and $M$ has a *finite* filtration with highest weight sections, so $M$ should involve only a finite number of central characters $\chi_\lambda$ (where $\lambda \in\lieh\dual$).

> Note: an analog of Jordan decomposition works here because of this finiteness condition.
> This discussion will parallel the JCF of a simple operator on a finite dimensional $\CC\dash$vector space.
> However, this involves the *entire* center instead of just scalar matrices, so the analogy is diagonalizing a family of operators simultaneously.

Let $\chi \in \hat \mcz(\lieg)$ and $M\in \OO$.
Let 
$$
M^\chi = \theset{v\in M \suchthat ~\forall z\in \mcz(\lieg),~\exists n>0 \st (z- \chi(z))^n \cdot v = 0$}
$$

Idea: write $z = \chi(z) \cdot 1 + (z-\chi(z)\cdot 1)$, where the first is a scalar operator and the second is (locally) nilpotent on $M^\chi$.
Thus we can always arrange for $z$ to act by a sum of "Jordan blocks":

Observations:

- $M^\chi$ are $U(\lieg)\dash$submodules of $M$.
- The subspaces $M^\chi$ are linearly independent

Recall that we have a decomposition $\OO = \bigoplus_{\chi \in \hat\mcz(\lieg)} \OO_\chi$ into infinitesimal blocks, where $\OO_0 \definedas \OO_{\chi_0}$ is the principal block.
Since $0\in\lieh\dual$, we can associate $\chi_0. M_0, L(0) = \CC$ the trivial module for $\lieg$.

## 1.14 -- 1.15: Formal Characters

Some background from finite dimensional representation theory of a finite group $G$ over $\CC$.
The hope is to find matrices for each element of $G$, but this isn't basis invariant.
Instead, we take traces of these matrices, which is less data and basis-independent
This is referred to as the *character* of the representation, and in nice situations, the characters determine the irreducible representations.

For a semisimple lie algebra $\lieg$ and a finite dimensional representation $M$, it's enough to keep track of weight multiplicities when $\lieg$ is the lie algebra associated to a compact lie group $G$.
From this data, the characters can be recovered.
So the data of all pairs $(\dim M_\lambda, \lambda \in \lieh\dual)$ suffices.
To track this information, we introduce a *formal character*.

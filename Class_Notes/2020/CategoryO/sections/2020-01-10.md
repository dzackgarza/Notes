Let $\lieg$ be a finite dimensional semisimple lie algebra over $\CC$.

Recall that this means is has no (? proper solvable ideals ?).

A more useful characterizatiion is that $\kappa \lieg\tensor \lieg \to \lieg$ is a *non-degenerate* symmetric (associative) bilinear form.

The running example we'll use is $\lieg = \liesl(n, \CC)$.

Let $\lieh$ be a maximal toral subalgebra, where $x\in\lieg$ is *toral* if $x$ is semisimple, i.e. $\ad x$ is semisimple, i.e. diagonalizable.

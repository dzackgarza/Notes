## Review

The Weyl vector is given by $\rho = \bar \omega_1 + \cdots + \bar \omega_\ell = \frac 1 2 \sum_{\beta \in \Phi^+} \beta \in \Lambda^+$.

- If $\alpha \in \Delta$ then $(\pho, \alpha\dual) = 1$
- $s_\alpha(\rho) = \rho - \alpha$.

Let $\lambda \in \Lambda^+$; a few facts:

1. The size of $\theset{\mu\in \Lambda^+ \suchthat \mu \leq \lambda}$ (with the partial order from last time) is finite.
2. $w\lambda < \lambda$ for all $w\in W$.

The Weyl chamber (for a fixed root, $E =$ Euclidean space) is $C = \theset{\lambda \in E \suchthat (\lambda, \alpha) > 0 ~ \forall \alpha\in\Delta}$
(Note that the hyperplane splits $E$ into connected components, we mark this component as distinguished.)

- A connected component of the union of hyperplanes is orthogonal to roots
- They're in bijection with $\Delta$
- They're permuted simply transitively by $W$.

And $\bar C$ denotes the fundamental domain.

## Weight Representations

For $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$, we let $M_\lambda = \theset{v\in M \suchthat h\cdot v = \lambda(h) v ~\foral h\in\lieh}$.

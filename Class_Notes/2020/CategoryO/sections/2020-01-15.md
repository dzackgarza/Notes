The Weyl vector is given by $\rho = \bar \omega_1 + \cdots + \bar \omega_\ell = \frac 1 2 \sum_{\beta \in \Phi^+} \beta \in \Lambda^+$.

- If $\alpha \in \Delta$ then $(\pho, \alpha\dual) = 1$
- $s_\alpha(\rho) = \rho - \alpha$.

Let $\lambda \in \Lambda^+$; a few facts:

1. The size of $\theset{\mu\in \Lambda^+ \suchthat \mu \leq \lambda}$ (with the partial order from last time) is finite.

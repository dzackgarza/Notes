Last time:
The second character formula,

\begin{align*}
ch L(\lambda) =  \ch M(\lambda) + \sum_{\mu < \lambda, \mu \in W\cdot \lambda} b_{\lambda, \mu} \ch M(\mu)
.\end{align*}

Note that $b_{\lambda, \mu} \in \ZZ$, and this formula comes from inverting the previous one.

> Want characters of simple modules!

Last time:
The second character formula,

\begin{align*}
ch L(\lambda) =  \ch M(\lambda) + \sum_{\mu < \lambda, \mu \in W\cdot \lambda} b_{\lambda, \mu} \ch M(\mu)
.\end{align*}

Note that $b_{\lambda, \mu} \in \ZZ$, and this formula comes from inverting the previous one.

> Holy grail: characters of simple modules!

We can write $M(\lambda) \cong U(\lien^-) \tensor_\CC \CC_\lambda$ as a $\lieh\dash$module.
Define $p: \lieh\dual \to \ZZ$ where $p(\gamma)$ is the number of tuples $(t_\beta)_{\beta\in\Phi^+}$ where $t_\beta \in \ZZ^+$ and $\gamma = - \sum_{\beta \in \Phi^+} t_\beta \beta$.
We have $\supp p = - \ZZ^+ \Phi^+$, which gives us something like a negative quadrant of the lattice.
The function $p$ is essentially the *Kostant partition function*. 
The advantage here is that $p \in \mcx$ (defined last time, support is less than some finite weights?).

Observation:
$p = \ch_{M(0)}$ since $U(\lien^-) \tensor \CC_{\lambda = 0}$ has PBW basis $\theset{ \prod_{\beta\in\Phi^+} y_\beta^{t_\beta} \tensor 1_{\lambda = 0} \suchthat t_\beta \in \ZZ^+  }$.


Example: 
Let $\lieg = \liesl(3)$, then $\Phi^+ = \theset{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_1 + \alpha_2}$.
Then $\gamma = -\qty{\alpha_1 + 2\alpha_2}$ corresponds to $(1,2,0), (0,1,1)$ so $p(\gamma) = 2$.
If $\gamma = -\qty{2\alpha_1 + 2\alpha_2}$, this corresponds to $(2,2,0), (1,1,1), (0,0,2)$ so $p(\gamma) = 3$.

> Note: just the number of ways of obtaining $-\gamma$ as a linear combinations of roots.

In general, $\dim M(0)_\gamma = p(\gamma)$.

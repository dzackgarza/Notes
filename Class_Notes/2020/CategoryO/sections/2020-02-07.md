So far, we have $\chi_\lambda = \chi_{w.\cdot \lambda}$ if $\lambda \in \Lambda$ and $w\in W$.
We have $\lieh\dual \supset \Lambda$ which is topologically equivalent to $\AA^\ell \supset \ZZ^\ell$, where $\ZZ^\ell$ is dense in the Zariski topology.

For $z\in \mcgZ(\lieg)$, we have $\chi_\lambda(z) = \chi_{W\cdot \lambda} (z)$ and so $\lambda(\xi(z)) = (w\cdot \lambda )(\xi(z))$ 
where $\xi: \mcz(\lieg) \to U(\lieh) = S(\lieh) \cong P(\lieh\dual)$ where we send $\lambda(f)$ to $f(\lambda)$.

Then $\xi(z)(\lambda) = \xi(z)(w\cdot \lambda)$ for all $\lambda \in \Lambda$, and so $\xi(z) = w\inv \xi(z)$ on $\Lambda$.
But both sides here are polynomials and thus continuous, and $\Lambda \subset \lieh\dual$ is dense, so $\xi(z) = w\inv \xi(z)$ on all of $\lieh\dual$.
I.e., $\chi_\lambda = \chi_{w\cdot } \lambda$ for all $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$.

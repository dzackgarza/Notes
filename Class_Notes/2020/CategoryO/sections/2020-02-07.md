So far, we have $\chi_\lambda = \chi_{w.\cdot \lambda}$ if $\lambda \in \Lambda$ and $w\in W$.
We have $\lieh\dual \supset \Lambda$ which is topologically equivalent to $\AA^\ell \supset \ZZ^\ell$, where $\ZZ^\ell$ is dense in the Zariski topology.

For $z\in \mcgZ(\lieg)$, we have $\chi_\lambda(z) = \chi_{W\cdot \lambda} (z)$ and so $\lambda(\xi(z)) = (w\cdot \lambda )(\xi(z))$ 
where $\xi: \mcz(\lieg) \to U(\lieh) = S(\lieh) \cong P(\lieh\dual)$ where we send $\lambda(f)$ to $f(\lambda)$.

Then $\xi(z)(\lambda) = \xi(z)(w\cdot \lambda)$ for all $\lambda \in \Lambda$, and so $\xi(z) = w\inv \xi(z)$ on $\Lambda$.
But both sides here are polynomials and thus continuous, and $\Lambda \subset \lieh\dual$ is dense, so $\xi(z) = w\inv \xi(z)$ on all of $\lieh\dual$.
I.e., $\chi_\lambda = \chi_{w\cdot } \lambda$ for all $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$.

This in fact shows that the image of $\mcz(\lieg)$ under $\xi$ consists of $W\dash$invariant polynomials.

It's customary to state this in terms of the natural action of $W$ on polynomials without the row-shift.
We do this by letting $\tau_\rho: S(\lieh) \mapsvia{\cong} S(\lieh)$ be the algebra automorphism induced by $f(\lambda) \mapsto f(\lambda - \rho)$.
This is clearly invertible by $f(\lambda) \mapsto f(\lambda + \rho)$.
We then define $\psi: \mcz(\lieg) \mapsvia{\xi} S(\lieh) \mapsvia{\tau_\rho} S(\lieh)$ as this composition; this is referred to as the Harish-Chandra (HC) homomorphism.

Exercise:
Show $\chi_\lambda(z) = (\lambda + \rho) (\psi(z))$ and $\chi_{w\cdot \lambda} (w(\lambda+\rho))(\psi(z))$, where $w(\wait)$ is the usual $w\dash$action.
Replacing $\lambda$ by $\lambda + \rho$ and $w$ by $w\inv$, we get 
$$
w\psi(z) = \psi(z)
$$ 
for all $z\in \mcz(\lieg)$ and all $w\in W$ where $(w\psi(z))(\lambda) = \psi(z)(w\inv \lambda)$.

We've proved that

Theorem:

a. If $\lambda, \mu \in \lieh\dual$ that are linked, then $\chi_\lambda = \chi_\mu$.

b. The image of the twisted HC homomorphism $\psi: \mcz(\lieg) \to U(\lieh) = S(\lieh)$ lies in the subalgebra $S(\lieh)^W$.

Example:
Let $\lieg = \liesl_2$.
Recall from finite-dimensional representations there is a canonical element $c\in \mcz(\lieg)$ called the Casimir element.
For $\OO$, we need information about the full center $\mcz(\lieg)$ (hence introducing infinitesimal characters).

Expressing $c$ in the PBW basis yields $c = h^2 + 2h + 4yx$, where $h^2 + 2h \in U(\lieh)$ and $4yx \in \lien^- U(\lieg) + U(\lieg) \lien$.

> Enveloping algebra convention: $x$s, $h$s, $y$s

Then $\xi(c) = \pr(c) = h^2 + 2h$, and under the identification $\lieh\dual \iff \CC$ where $\lambda \iff \lambda(h)$, we can identify $\rho \iff \rho(h) = 1$.
The row shift is given by $\psi(c) = (h-1)^2 + 2(h-1) = h^2 - 1$.
This is $W\dash$invariant, since $s_\alpha_h = -h$.
But $W = \generators{s_\alpha, 1}$, so $s_\alpha$ generates $W$.

We also have $\chi_\lambda(c) = (\lambda + \rho) (\psi(c)) = (\lambda+1)^2 - 1$.

Category $\mathcal O$:
We have finite dimensional, semisimple modules over $\CC$ with triangular decompositions.

If $M$ is any $U(\lieg)$ module than a $v^+ \in M_\lambda$ a weight vector (so $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$) is primitive iff $\lien \cdot v^+ = 0$.
Note: it doesn't have to be of maximal weight.
$M$ is a highest weight module of highest weight $\lambda$ iff it's generated over $U(\lieg)$ as an associative algebra by a maximal vector $v^+$ of weight $\lambda$.
Then $M = U(\lieg) \cdot v^+$.

See structure of highest weight modules, and irreducibility.

Corollary:
If $0 \neq M\in\mathcal O$, then $M$ has a finite filtration with quotients highest weight modules, i.e. $M_0 \subset M_1 \subset \cdots \subset M_n = M$ with $M_i/M_{i-1}$ highest weight modules.
Note that the quotients are not necessarily simple, so this isn't a composition series, although we'll show such a series exists later.

Theorem:
Let $V$ be the $\lien$ submodule of $M$ generated by a finite set of weight vectors which generate $M$ as a $U(\lieg)$ module.
I.e. take the finite set of weight vectors and act on them by $U(\lien)$.
Then $\dim_\CC V < \infty$ since $M$ is locally $\lien\dash$finite.

Proof:
Induction on $n = \dim V$.
If $n=1$, $M$ itself is a highest weight module.

> Note that $\lien$ increases weights.

For $n > 1$, choose a weight vector $v_1 \in V$ of weight $\lambda$ which is maximal among all weights of $V$.
Set $M_1 \definedas U(\lieg) v_1$; this is a highest weight submodule of $M$ of highest weight $\lambda$.
($\lien$ has to kill v_1, otherwise it increases weight and $v_1$ wouldn't be maximal.)

Let $\bar M = M/M_1 \in \mathcal O$, this is generated by the image of $\bar V$ of $V$ and thus $\dim \bar V < \dim V$.

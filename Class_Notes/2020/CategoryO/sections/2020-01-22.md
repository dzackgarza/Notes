Try problems 1.1 and 1.3*.

Category $\mathcal O$:
We have finite dimensional, semisimple modules over $\CC$ with triangular decompositions.

If $M$ is any $U(\lieg)$ module than a $v^+ \in M_\lambda$ a weight vector (so $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$) is primitive iff $r \cdot v^+ = 0$.
Note: it doesn't have to be of maximal weight.
$M$ is a highest weight module of highest weight $\lambda$ iff it's generated over $U(\lieg)$ as an associative algebra by a maximal vector $v^+$ of weight $\lambda$.
Then $M = U(\lieg) \cdot v^+$.

See structure of highest weight modules, and irreducibility.

Corollary:
If $0 \neq M\in\mathcal O$, then $M$ has a finite filtration with quotients highest weight modules, i.e. $M_0 \subset M_1 \subset \cdots \subset M_n = M$ with $M_i/M_{i-1}$ highest weight modules.
Note that the quotients are not necessarily simple, so this isn't a composition series, although we'll show such a series exists later.

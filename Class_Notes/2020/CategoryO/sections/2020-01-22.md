Note:
Try problems 1.1 and 1.3*.

Category $\mathcal O$:
We have finite dimensional, semisimple modules over $\CC$ with triangular decompositions.

If $M$ is any $U(\lieg)$ module than a $v^+ \in M_\lambda$ a weight vector (so $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$) is primitive iff $r \cdot v^+ = 0$.
Note: it doesn't have to be of maximal weight.
$M$ is a highest weight module of highest weight $\lambda$ iff it's generated over $U(\lieg)$ as an associative algebra by a maximal vector $v^+$ of weight $\lambda$.
Then $M = U(\lieg) \cdot v^+$.

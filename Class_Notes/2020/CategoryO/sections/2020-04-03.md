Recall from last time that we defined a new partial order for all positive roots generated by "reflecting down", namely *strong linkage*.
We had a theorem: $\mu \uparrow \lambda \implies M(\mu)$ occurs as a composition factor of $M(\lambda)$.
We also have a side-arrow notation $w' \mapsvia{s_\alpha} w$ indicates that $w' = s_\alpha w$ and $w'$ is shorter than $w$.
We conclude that $x\cdot \lambda \uparrow w\cdot \lambda \iff x\leq w$ for $x, w\in W$, where the RHS is the usual Bruhat order and is notably independent of $\lambda$.

Corollary
:   Let $\lambda \in \Lambda$ be antidominant and $\rho\dash$regular and $x, w\in W$.
    Then
    $$
    [M(w\cdot \lambda) : L(x\cdot \lambda)] \neq 0 \iff M(x\cdot \lambda) \injects M(w\cdot \lambda) \iff x \leq w
    $$
Note that this statement is why we use antidominant instead of dominant, since this equation now goes in the right direction.

## Jantzen Filtration

Theorem
:   Given $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$, $M(\lambda)$ has a terminating descending filtration satisfying

    a. Each nonzero quotient has a certain nondegenerate contravariant form (3.14)

    b. $M(\lambda)^i = N(\lambda)$

    c. $\sum_{i > 0} \ch M(\lambda)^i = \sum_{\alpha > 0, s_\alpha \cdot \lambda < \lambda} \ch M(s_\alpha \cdot \lambda)$ (the Integer sum formula, very important)

Note that the sum on the RHS is over $\theset{ \alpha\in\Phi^+_{[\lambda]} \suchthat s_\alpha \cdot \lambda < \lambda } \definedas \Phi^+_\lambda$.

Fact
:   $\soc M(\lambda) = L(\mu)$ for the unique antidominant $\mu$ in $W_{[\lambda]}\cdot \lambda$.
    Moreover, $[M(\lambda) : L(\mu)] = 1$.

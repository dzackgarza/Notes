Recall from last time that we defined a new partial order for all positive roots generated by "reflecting down", namely *strong linkage*.
We had a theorem: $\mu \uparrow \lambda \implies M(\mu)$ occurs as a composition factor of $M(\lambda)$.
We also have a side-arrow notation $w' \mapsvia{s_\alpha} w$ indicates that $w' = s_\alpha w$ and $w'$ is shorter than $w$.
We conclude that $x\cdot \lambda \uparrow w\cdot \lambda \iff x\leq w$ for $x, w\in W$.

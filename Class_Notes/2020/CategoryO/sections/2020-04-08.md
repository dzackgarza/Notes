Recall that we are setting up Jantzen's filtration.
Let $A$ be a PID, $\mfp \in A$ prime, $\bar A = A/pA$, $M$ a free $A\dash$module of rank $r$, with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form $(\wait ,\wait)$ having nonzero determinant wrt some basis of $M$.
Define $M(n), \bar{M(n)}$ as before

    1. $v_p(D) = \sum_{n > 0} \dim_{\bar A} \bar{M(n)}$
    2. For each $n$, the modified bilinear form induces a nondegenerate form on $\bar{M(n)} / p\bar{M(n)}$?

## Proof of Jantzen's Theorem

Let $A = \CC[T]$ and $K = \CC(T)$ its fraction field, and let $\lieg_A = A \tensor_\CC \lieg$ and $\lieg_K = K \tensor_\CC \lieg$, which is a Lie algebra that is split over $K$, i.e. every $h\in \lieh_K = K \tensor_\CC \lieh$ has all eigenvalues of $\ad \h$ in $K$.

The theory we need carries over to the extended setting.
The plan is the following:

- Construct and look at basic properties of Verma modules (1.3-1.4)
- Look at properties of their contravariant forms (3.14 - 3.15)
- Find a simplicity criterion (4.8)

We'll use Lemma 5.6 to construct filtrations on the weight spaces of the extended Verma module, the reduce mod $T$ (using evaluation morphisms) to assemble the Jantzen filtration for the original $\CC\dash$module.

Given $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$, set $\lambda_T = \lambda + T_\rho \in \lieh_K\dual$.
For all $\alpha\in \Phi$, we have
\begin{align*}
(\lambda_T  + \rho, \alpha\dual) =
(\lambda + \rho , \alpha\dual) + T(\rho, \alpha\dual) \not\in\ZZ
,\end{align*}
since this is a linear polynomial.
So $\lambda_T$ is antidominant.

Therefore $M(\lambda_T)$ is simple, and equivalently (unique up to scalars) its nonzero contravariant form is nondegenerate.

The module $U(\lieg_A) \cong A \tensor_\CC U(\lieg)$ is a natural "$A\dash$form" of $U(\lieg_K) \cong K \tensor_\CC U(\lieg)$.
This yields $M(\lambda_T)_A$, an $A\dash$form of $M(\lambda_T)$, where each weight space is an $A\dash$module of finite rank.

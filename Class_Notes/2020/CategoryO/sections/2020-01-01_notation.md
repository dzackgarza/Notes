# Definitions

- Indecomposable: doesn't decompose as $A oplus B$. Weaker than irreducible.
- Irreducible: simple, i.e. no nontrivial proper submodules. Implies indecomposable.
- Semisimple: Direct sum of simple.
- Solvable: Obtained as a tower of extensions of abelian groups; derived series terminates; composition series has cyclic sections.

# List of Notation

- $M(\lambda)$: Verma Modules

- $L(\lambda)$: Unique simple quotients of Verma modules.

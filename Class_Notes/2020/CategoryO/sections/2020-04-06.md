Note that most of the theory thus far has not relied on the properties of $\CC$, so Jantzen's strategy was to extend the base field to $K = \CC(T)$, rational functions in $T$, then setting $g_K \definedas K \tensor_\CC \lieg$.
The theory over $K$ adapts to $A = \CC[T]$, the PID of polynomials in one variable $T$ with $K$ as its fraction field and the "Lie algebra" $g_A = A \tensor_\CC \lieg$.

Note that most of the theory thus far has not relied on the properties of $\CC$, so Jantzen's strategy was to extend the base field to $K = \CC(T)$, rational functions in $T$, then setting $g_K \definedas K \tensor_\CC \lieg$.
The theory over $K$ adapts to $A = \CC[T]$, the PID of polynomials in one variable $T$ with $K$ as its fraction field and the "Lie algebra" $g_A = A \tensor_\CC \lieg$.

Setup:
Let $A$ be any PID, for example $\ZZ$ or $\CC[T]$, and $M$ a free $A\dash$module of finite rank $r$.
Let $e, f\in M$ and suppose $M$ has an $A\dash$valued symmetric bilinear form denoted $(\wait, \wait)$.
Since $M$ is finite rank, we can choose a basis $\theset{e_i}^r$, so the matrix $F$ of this form relative to this basis has nonzero determinant $D$ depending on the choice of basis.
A change of basis is realized by some $P \in \Gl(r, A)$, giving $F' = P^t F P$ (note that forms change by a transpose instead of an inverse) and $\det P \in A\units$.
Thus $D$ only changes by a unit $u = \qty{\det P}^2$.

We can define the dual module $M^* = \hom_A(M, A)$ which is also free of rank $r$, and contains a submodule $M\dual$ consisting of functions $e\dual: M \to A$ given by $e\dual(f) = (e, f)$ for any fixed $e\in M$.
Surprisingly, this doesn't give every hom: e.g. if the form only has even outputs.
Since $(\wait, \wait)$ is nondegenerate, the map $\phi: M\to M\dual$ sending $e$ to $e\dual$ is an isomorphism.

We'll now invoke the structure theory of modules over a PID: There exists a basis of $M^*$ given by $\theset{e+i^*}^r$ where $M\dual$ has a basis $\theset{d_i e_i^*}^r$ for some scalars $0\neq d_i \in A$.
We can define a dual basis of $M$ given by $\theset{e_i}^r$ where $e_i^*(e_j) = \delta_{ij}$.

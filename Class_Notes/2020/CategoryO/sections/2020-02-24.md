Recall that for $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$, we can associate $\Phi_{[\lambda]}$ and $W_{[\lambda]}$ and consider $W_{[\lambda]} \cdot \lambda$.
When $\lambda \in \Lambda$ is integral and $\mu \in W\lambda \intersect \Lambda^+$, we have $M(\mu) \to L(\mu)$ its simple quotient, which is finite-dimensional.

Recall that for $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$, we can associate $\Phi_{[\lambda]}$ and $W_{[\lambda]}$ and consider $W_{[\lambda]} \cdot \lambda$.
When $\lambda \in \Lambda$ is integral and $\mu \in W\lambda \intersect \Lambda^+$, we have $M(\mu) \to L(\mu)$ its simple quotient, which is finite-dimensional.

Definition
:   $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$ is *antidominant* if $(\lambda + \rho, \alpha\dual) \not\in \ZZ^{> 0}$ for all $\alpha \in \Phi^+$.
    Dually, $\lambda$ is *dominant* if $(\lambda + \rho, \alpha\dual)\not\in\ZZ^{<0}$ for all $\alpha\in\Phi^+$.

Note that most weights are both dominant and antidominant.
Example: take $\lambda = -\rho$.
We won't use the dominant condition often.

Remark
:   For $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$, $W\cdot \lambda$ and $W_{[\lambda]}\cdot \lambda$ contain at least one antidominant weight.

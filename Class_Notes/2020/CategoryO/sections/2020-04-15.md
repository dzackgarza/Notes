Section 7.6, proved theorem about translation functors on Verma modules.
We fixed an antidominant weight, since we can apply elements of $W$ to obtain the rest.
We proved that translation functors take Verma modules to Verma modules.

Corollary
: If $M\in \OO_\chi$ has a standard filtration, then so does $T_\lambda^\mu M \in \OO_\mu$.

Proof
:   By induction on the length of the filtration, where the length 1 case is handled by the theorem.
    In general we have $0 \to N \to M \to M(w\cdot \lambda) \to 0$ and since $T_\lmabda^\mu$ is exact, we can apply it to get another exact sequence.

We want to show the following identity:

\begin{align*}
\qty{ U(\lieg) \tensor_{U(\lieb)} L } \tensor_\CC M 
\cong
U(\lieg) \tensor_{U(\lieb)} \qty{ L \tensor_\CC M  }
.\end{align*}

Assume $L$ and $M$ are finite dimensional. Then for $N = L \tensor M$, there is a basis of weight vectors $v_1, \cdots, v_n, \nu_1, \cdots, \nu_m$ with $\nu_i \leq \nu_j \iff i\leq j$.
Moreover $N_k = \CC \generators{v_k, \cdots, v_n} = U(\lieb)\generators{v_k, \cdots, v_n}$, and we have a natural filtration

\begin{align*}
0 \subset N_n \subset \cdots \subset N_1 = N
\end{align*}
 with $N_i / N_{i+1} \cong \CC_{v_i}$ as $\lieb\dash$modules.

 We thus obtain $\ind_\lieb^\lieg N_i / \ind_\lieb^\lieg N_{i+1} \cong \ind_\lieb^\lieg \CC_{v_i} = M(v_i)$ by exactness of the Ind functor.
 Apply this to $L = \CC_\lambda$, then the LHS is $M(\lambda) \tensor_\CC M$, where $M$ is finite dimensional.
 On the RHS, $N = \CC_\lambda \tensor M$ has the same dimension as $M$ with weights $\lambda + \mu$ for $\mu \in \Pi(M)$.
 Thus $M(\lambda) \tensor M$ has filtration with quotients $M(\lambda + \mu)$ over $\mu \in \Pi(M)$, which was the theorem we had last time.

 Remark
 : The proof shows that $M(\lambda) \tensor M$ has a submodules $M(\lambda + \mu)$ for any maximal weight $\mu$ of $M$, and a quotient $M(\lambda + \nu)$ where $\nu$ is any minimal weight of $M$.
  We knew that every $M\in \OO$ has a finite filtration, but here the quotients are now Verma modules.
  This will help us study projectives later, which we need to study higher Exts.

## Standard Filtrations

There are several main players in the theory of highest-weight categories:

- Simple modules $L(\lambda)$
- Standard modules $M(\lambda)$
- Costandard modules $M(\lambda)\dual$
- Indecomposable projectives $P(\lambda)$
- Tilting modules $T(\lambda)$.

Definition (A standard filtration or Verma flag)
: A *standard filtration* of $M\in \OO$ is a filtration with quotients isomorphic to Verma modules.

For $p\in \QQ[x]$, we'll denote $p[i]$ the $i$th coefficient.

For $M\in \OO$ or any module of finite length, we define its radical series: $\rad^0 M = M, \rad^{i+1} M = \rad(\rad^i M)$.
Note that the subquotients are semisimple.

Dually, $\soc M$ is the largest semisimple submodules of $M$, and iterating this yield the *socle series*.
Denote $\soc_i M \defubedas \soc^{i+1} M / \soc^i M$ the $i$th socle layer.

For convenience, set $Q_{x, w} = P_{w_0 w, w_0 x}(q)$ the "inverse" KL polynomial.
Recall that a consequence of the KL conjecture is that $[M_w] = \sum_{x\leq w} Q_{x, w}(1) [L_x]$

The following theorem follows from the Jahntzen conjecture

Theorem
:   \hfill

    a. $Q_{x, w}[i] = [ \rad_{\ell(xw) - 2i} M_w : L_x] = [\soc_{\ell(x) + 2i} M_w: L_x]$ (note that Humphreys adds $+1$ here due to indexing)
    b. If $x < w$, then $\dim \ext^1 (L_x, L_w) = \mu(x, w)$.

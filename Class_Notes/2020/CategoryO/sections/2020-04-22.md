For $p\in \QQ[x]$, we'll denote $p[i]$ the $i$th coefficient.

For $M\in \OO$ or any module of finite length, we define its radical series: $\rad^0 M = M, \rad^{i+1} M = \rad(\rad^i M)$.
Note that the subquotients are semisimple.

Dually, $\soc M$ is the largest semisimple submodules of $M$, and iterating this yield the *socle series*.

Chapter 11: Tilting Modules.

Recall that these are defined by modules with both a standard and a costandard filtration.

Theorem (7.14)
:   Let $\lambda, \mu \in \Lambda$ be antidominant with $\lambda$ regular (so in the antidominant chamber $C$) and $\mu$ lies on a single simple root wall $H_\alpha \intersect \bar C$ (i.e. the stabilizers $W_\mu^0)$ of $\mu$ under the dot action is $\theset{1, s}$ with $s = s_\alpha$ for some $\alpha \in \Delta$.)\
    Assume that $w\in W$ with $ws > w$, then

    a. There is a SES (singular to regular, translation off the wall): $$ 0 \to M(ws \cdot \lambda ) \to T_{\mu}^\lambda M(w\cdot \mu) \to M(w\cdot \lambda) \to 0.$$
    b. The head is given by $\text{Head} T_{\mu}^\lambda M(w\cdot \mu) = L(w\cdot \lambda)$, and in particular the LHS is indecomposable and the sequence in (a) is non-split.

The SES here represents starting at the RHS, translating to get to a wall to get the middle term, then translating off the wall and picking up an $s$ term.

To see that standard and costandard filtrations exist, we can consider:

Also recall Proposition 3.7a: If $M\in \OO$ has a standard filtration and $\lambda \in \Pi(M)$ is maximal, then $M(\lambda) \injects M$ and $M/M(\lambda)$ has a standard filtration.

Theorem
:   Let $\lambda \in \Lambda$:

    a. There exists an indecomposable tilting module $T(\lambda) \in \OO_{\text{int}}$ such that $\dim T(\lambda)o_\lambda = 1$ and $\mu \in \Pi(T(\lambda)) \implies \mu \leq \lambda$.
      In particular, $( T(\lambda): M(\lambda) ) = 1$ and $M(\lambda) \injects T(\lambda)$.

      > Note that this implies that $T(\lambda)$ must lie in the single block $\OO_{\chi_\lambda}$, since it has a Verma $M(\lambda)$ and is indecomposable.

    b. Every indecomposable tilting module in $\OO_{\text{int}}$ is isomorphic to $T(\lambda)$ for some $\lambda \in \Lambda$.
    c. $T(\lambda)$ is the only tilting module up ti isomorphicin $\OO_{\text{int}}$ having the properties in (a).

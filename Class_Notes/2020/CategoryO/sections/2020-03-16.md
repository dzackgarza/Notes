Proposition
: Suppose $\lambda + \rho$ is dominant integral, then

- $M(w\cdot \lambda) \subset M(\lambda)$ for all $w\in W$
- $[M(\lambda): L(w\cdot \lambda)] > 0$ for all $w\in W$

  More precisely, if $w = s_1 \cdots s_\ell$ is reduced with $s_i = s_{\alpha_i}$ and $\lambda_k = s_k \cdots s_1 \cdot \lambda$, then

  ...

  Proof
  : By induction on $n = \ell(w)$.
    The $n=0$ case is obvious.
    For $\ell(w) = k+1$, write $w'= s_k \cdots s_1$.
    From section 0.3, $(w')\inv \alpha_{k+1} > 0$.
    We can compute
    \begin{align*}
    (\lambda_k + \rho, \alpha_{k+1}\dual)
    &= (w' \cdots \lambda + \rho, \alpha_{k+1}\dual) \\
    &= (w'(\lambda + \rho), \alpha_{k+1}\dual) \\
    &= (\lambda + \rho, (w')\inv \alpha_{k+1}\dual) \\
    &= (\lambda + \rho, ((w')\inv \alpha_{k+1})\dual) \\
    &\in \ZZ^{+}
    \end{align*}
    since $\lambda + \rho \in \Lambda^+$ and $(w')\inv \alpha_{k+1} \in \Phi^+$.


    This means that $\lambda_{k+1} = s_{k+1} \lambda_k \leq \lambda_k$.
    By proposition 1.4, reformulated in terms of the dot action, we have a map $M(\lambda_{k+1}) \injects M(\lambda_k)$, and nonzero morphisms are injective by 4.2a.

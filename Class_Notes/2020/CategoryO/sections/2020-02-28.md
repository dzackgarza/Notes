Recall that $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$ is *dominant* iff for all $\alpha \in \Phi^+$, we have $(\lambda + \rho, \alpha\dual) \not\in\ZZ^{<0}$.
Equivalently, as in Proposition 3.5c, $\lambda$ is maximal in its $W_{[\lambda]}\cdot$ orbit.

## Constructing Projectives 

Proposition
:   a. If $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$ is dominant, then $M(\lambda)$ is projective in $\OO$.
  
    b. If $P\in \OO$ is projective and $\dim L < \infty$< then $P \tensor_\CC L$ is projective.

Subfunctors:

A functor $F' \subset F: (\Sch/S)^{op} \to \Sets$ is open iff for all $T \mapsvia{\xi} F$ where $T = h_T$ and $\xi \in F(T)$.
We can take fiber products:

So we can think of "inclusion in $F$" as being an open condition: for all $T/S$ and $\xi \in F(T)$, there exists an open $U \subset T$ such that for all covers $f: T' \tp T$, we have $F(f)(\xi) = f^*(\xi) \in F'(T')$ iff $f$ factors through $U$.

Suppose $U \subset T$ in $\Sch/T$,  we then have

\begin{align*}
h_{U/T}(T') = \begin{cases}
\emptyset & T' \to T \text{ doesn't factor } \\
\pt & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
.\end{align*}

which follows because the literal statement is $h_{U/T}(T') = \hom_T(T', U)$.

By the definition of the fiber product, $(F' \cross_F T)(T') = \theset{ (a,b) \in F'(T) \cross T(T) \suchthat \xi(b) = \iota(a) \text{ in  } F(T)}$, where $F' \mapsvia{\iota} F$ and $T \mapsvia{\xi} F$.

So note that the RHS diagram here is exactly given by pullbacks, since we identify sections of $F/T'$ as sections of $F$ over $T/T'$ (?).

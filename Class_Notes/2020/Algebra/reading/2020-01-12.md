An ideal $\pr$ is prime iff $JK \subset \pr \implies J \subset \pr$ or $K\subset \pr$.

A ring is a domain iff the ideal $(0)$ is prime.

> Inductively, if $\pr$ contains a product of ideals then it contains one of them.

Maximal ideals are prime, since $\mm$ maximal implies that $R/\mm$ is a field.

A ring is *local* iff it has a unique maximal ideal $\mm$.

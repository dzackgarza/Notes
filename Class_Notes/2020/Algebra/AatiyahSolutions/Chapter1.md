Proposition 1.1:
Fix an ideal $\mfa \normal R$.
There is a correspondence

\begin{align*}
\correspond{\mfb \suchthat \mfa \subseteq \mfb \normal R} \iff
\correspond{\tilde \mvb \normal R/\mfa}
.\end{align*}

Proof:
?

Proposition 1.2:
TFAE

- $R$ is a field
- $R$ is simple, i.e. the only ideals of $R$ are $0, R$.
- Every homomorphism $\phi: R\to S$ for $S$ an arbitrary ring is injective.

Proof:
?

Proposition:
Maximal ideals are prime.

Proof:
?

Proposition:
If $\mfp \normal R$ is prime, $R/\mfp$ is a domain.
If $\mfm \normal R$ is maximal, $R/\mfr$ is a field.

Proof:
?

Theorem 1.3:
Every ring $R$ has a nontrivial maximal ideal $I \neq 0$, and every ideal is contained in a maximal ideal.

Proof:
?

Corollary 1.5:
Every non-unit of $R$ is contained in a maximal ideal.

Proof:
?

Proposition 1.6:
If $A\setminus \mfm \subset R\units$, then $A$ is a local ring with $\mfm$ its maximal ideal.
If $\mfm$ is maximal and $1+m \in R\units$ for all $m\in \mfm$, then $A$ is a local ring.

Proof:
?

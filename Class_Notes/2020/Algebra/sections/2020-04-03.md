Recall that the definition of a normal series for $G$ a group.

Theorem (Jordan Holder)
: Any two composition series for the same group $G$ are equivalent (same isomorphism classes of quotients and multiplicities).

There is an analog of this for modules, even over a noncommutative ring:  this is just a sequence of submodules inclusions, since normality is automatic.
There is similarly a notion of Schreir refinement.
For $p$ groups, the composition factors have to be cyclic of order $p$.
On one hand, we could fix the series and ask for what modules have a compatible composition series -- this is the extension problem, and is difficult in general.
Here we will fix the module and see what the possible composition series are.

Recall that we had an antitone bijection

\begin{align*}
\text{prime ideals of } R & \iff \text{irreducible closed subsets of } \sec R \\
\text{maximal ideals} &\iff \text{Singletons } \teset{p}, p\text{ closed} \\
\text{minimal primes} &\iff \text{maximal irreducible closed subsets}
.\end{align*}

Note that the last item on the RHS corresponds to an irreducible component.

Definition
: A topological space $X$ is *Noetherian* iff the ascending chain conditions holds for open sets.

Proposition (13.14)
: $X$ is a Noetherian space iff every *open* subset $U \subset X$ is quasicompact.

Recall that we had an antitone bijection

\begin{align*}
\text{prime ideals of } R & \iff \text{irreducible closed subsets of } \sec R \\
\text{maximal ideals} &\iff \text{Singletons } \teset{p}, p\text{ closed} \\
\text{minimal primes} &\iff \text{maximal irreducible closed subsets}
.\end{align*}

Note that the last item on the RHS corresponds to an irreducible component.

Definition
: A topological space $X$ is *Noetherian* iff the ascending chain conditions holds for open sets.

Proposition (13.14)
: $X$ is a Noetherian space iff every *open* subset $U \subset X$ is quasicompact. iff *all* subsets are quaaasicompact.

Note that this is a strange class of spaces!

Exercise
:   If $X$ is Noetherian and Hausdorff, then $X$ is finite.
    Conversely every finite space is Noetherian, regardless of whether or not it is Hausdorff.

Proposition
: A Noetherian space has finitely many connected components and is the direct sum (disjoint union) of its connected components.

This holds e.g. for manifolds, but not every topological space.
Thus if we're considering the topology of such spaces, we may as well assume they're connected.

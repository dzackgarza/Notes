Exercise
: If $f: R\to S$ is a ring morphism, then $f^*: \spec S \to \sec R$ is a continuous map of topological spaces.

Exercise
: Defining $R^{\text{red}} \definedas R/\mfm R$, show that $q^*: \spec R^{\text{red}} \to \spec R$ is a homeomorphism.

Exercise
: The bijection $\spec(\prod R_i) = \coprod \spec R_i$ is a canonical homeomorphism for finite (co)products.

Proposition
: For any ring, $\spec R$ is quasi-compact, i.e. every open cover has a finite subcover.

> Here, "compact" will denote quasi-compact and Hausdorff.

Proof (Sketch, Important to Check)
:   The open sets $U(f) \definedas \spec R \setminus V(f)$ are a base for the Zariski topology.
    It suffices to check that every open cover by basic open sets has a finite subcover.
    Can check that that the unit ideal is generated by finitely many elements.

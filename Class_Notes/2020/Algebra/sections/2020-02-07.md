## Projective Modules

For $X$ a topological space and $\pi:E\to X$ a real vector bundle on $X$.
Then $\Gamma(E, X) = \theset{\sigma: X\to E \suchthat \pi \circ \sigma = \id_X}$ is naturally a module over the ring $C(X, \RR)$ of continuous real-valued functions.
For $p\in X$, the fibers $\sigma(p) \in \pi\inv(p)$ are vector spaces, and we can consider $f(p)\sigma(p)$ for any $f\in C(X, \RR)$.

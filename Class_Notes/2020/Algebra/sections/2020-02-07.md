## Projective Modules

For $X$ a topological space and $\pi:E\to X$ a real vector bundle on $X$.
Then $\Gamma(E, X) = \theset{\sigma: X\to E \suchthat \pi \circ \sigma = \id_X}$ is naturally a module over the ring $C(X, \RR)$ of continuous real-valued functions.
For $p\in X$, the fibers $\sigma(p) \in \pi\inv(p)$ are vector spaces, and we can consider $f(p)\sigma(p)$ for any $f\in C(X, \RR)$.
For trivial bundles $\RR^n \cross X \mapsvia{\pi} X$ with a global section

\begin{align*}
\sigma: X &\to \RR^n \cross X \\
p &\mapsto (\tilde\sigma(p), p)
.\end{align*}

Then $\tilde\sigma: X \to \RR^n$, or equivalently a collection of $n$ continuous functions $\tilde\sigma_j \to \RR$.
Thus $\Gamma(X, E) \cong C(X, \RR)^n$.

Theorem (Swan):
Suppose $X$ is compact. 
Then

a. $\Gamma(X, E)$ is a finitely generated projective $C(X, \RR)\dash$module, i.e. $\pi$ is a direct summand of a trivial vector bundle on $X$, and

b. There is an equivalence of categories between vector bundles on $X$ and finitely generated projective $C(X, \RR)\dash$modules.

*Example:*
Let $X$ be the two points space $\theset{1, 2}$.
Take a 0-dimensional vector space over $1$ and a 1-dimensional vector space over $2$.

*Remark:*
Such cheap examples exist on $X$ iff $X$ is disconnected.

**Definition:**
Recall that it $0 \to A \to B \mapsvia{f} C \to 0$ is exact, then a *splitting* is a map $\sigma: C\to B$ such that $f\circ \sigma = \id_C$.
Then $B = A \oplus \sigma(C) \cong A \oplus C$.

*Exercise:*
Take $R=\ZZ$ and find a SES such that $B\cong_\ZZ A \oplus B$ but the sequence is *not* split.

**Definition:**
A module $P$ is projective iff $0 \to M \to N \to P \to 0$ is split.

> Exercise: show that free implies projective.
> Lift basis and use universal property.

**Theorem:**
If $P$ is projective, then there exists a $K$ such that $P\oplus K$ is free.

> Idea: summands can be *both* a submodule and a quotient module.

*Proof:*
Choose a free $F$ and an $R\dash$module surjection $q:F \surjects P$ with $K = \ker q$ to obtain $0 \to K \to F \to P \to 0$.

## Projective Modules

For $X$ a topological space and $\pi:E\to X$ a real vector bundle on $X$.
Then $\Gamma(E, X) = \theset{\sigma: X\to E \suchthat \pi \circ \sigma = \id_X}$ is naturally a module over the ring $C(X, \RR)$ of continuous real-valued functions.
For $p\in X$, the fibers $\sigma(p) \in \pi\inv(p)$ are vector spaces, and we can consider $f(p)\sigma(p)$ for any $f\in C(X, \RR)$.
For trivial bundles $\RR^n \cross X \mapsvia{\pi} X$ with a global section

\begin{align*}
\sigma: X &\to \RR^n \cross X \\
p &\mapsto (\tilde\sigma(p), p)
.\end{align*}

Then $\tilde\sigma: X \to \RR^n$, or equivalently a collection of $n$ continuous functions $\tilde\sigma_j \to \RR$.
Thus $\Gamma(X, E) \cong C(X, \RR)^n$.

Theorem (Swan):
Suppose $X$ is compact. 
Then

a. $\Gamma(X, E)$ is a finitely generated projective $C(X, \RR)\dash$module, i.e. $\pi$ is a direct summand of a trivial vector bundle on $X$, and

b. There is an equivalence of categories between vector bundles on $X$ and finitely generated projective $C(X, \RR)\dash$modules.

Example:
Let $X$ be the two points space $\theset{1, 2}$.

Coming up: the modules $\bigoplus \ZZ, \hom_R(M, N), M \tensor_R N$, as well as various properties:

- Torsion
- Torsionfree
- Free
- Projective
- Flat
- Injective
- Divisible

We have a series of implication
$$
\text{free} \implies \text{projective} \implies \text{flat} \implies \text{torsionfree}
$$

## Universal Mapping Properties

For a collection $\theset{M_i}$ of modules, the *direct product* is characterized by

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
&  &                                                     &  & M_j \\
N \arrow[rrrru, "\varphi_j", bend left] \arrow[rrrrd, "\varphi_k"', bend right] \arrow[rr, "\exists!", dotted] &  & \prod M_i \arrow[rrd, "\pi_k"] \arrow[rru, "\pi_j"] &  &     \\
&  &                                                     &  & M_k
\end{tikzcd}

# Wednesday January 29th

Coming up: the modules $\bigoplus \ZZ, \hom_R(M, N), M \tensor_R N$, as well as various properties:

- Torsion
- Torsionfree
- Free
- Projective
- Flat
- Injective
- Divisible

We have a series of implication
$$
\text{free} \implies \text{projective} \implies \text{flat} \implies \text{torsionfree}
$$

## Universal Mapping Properties

Definition
: For a collection $\theset{M_i}$ of modules, the *direct product* is characterized by

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
&  &                                                     &  & M_j \\
N \arrow[rrrru, "\varphi_j", bend left] \arrow[rrrrd, "\varphi_k"', bend right] \arrow[rr, "\exists!", dotted] &  & \prod M_i \arrow[rrd, "\pi_k"] \arrow[rru, "\pi_j"] &  &     \\
&  &                                                     &  & M_k
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Here we define the canonical projection by $\pi_j(m_1, \cdots, m_j, \cdots) = m_j$.

Fact
: $$\hom_R(N, \prod M_i) = \prod \hom_R(N, M_i)$$

Definition
: For a collection $\theset{M_i}$ of modules, the *direct sum* is characterized by

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
M_j \arrow[rrd, "\iota_i", hook] \arrow[rrrrd, "\varphi_j", bend left] &  &                                      &  &   \\
&  & \bigoplus M_i \arrow[rr, "\exists!"] &  & N \\
M_k \arrow[rru, "\iota_k"] \arrow[rrrru, "\varphi_k"', bend right]     &  &                                      &  &  
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Here we define the canonical *injection* by $\iota_j(m) = (0, 0, \cdots, m, 0, \cdots)$.
In this case, we can define $\phi(m_1, m_2, \cdots, m_i, \cdots) = \sum \phi_i(m_i)$, which makes sense because cofinitely many of the terms in this sum are zero.

## Free Modules

Definition
: For $M$ an $R\dash$module and $S\subset M$,

  1. $S$ *spans* $M$ if $\generators{S} = M$, where $\generators{S}$ is the set of all finite linear combinations of elements in $S$.

  2. $S$ is $R\dash$linearly independent iff $\sum r_i m_i = 0 \implies r_i = 0$ for all $i$.

  3. $S$ is a *basis* for $M$ iff $S$ is a spanning $R\dash$linearly independent subset of $M$.

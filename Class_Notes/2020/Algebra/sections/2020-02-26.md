## Radicals

For $R$ a ring, we defined $\nil(R) \definedas \theset{x\in R \suchthat \exists n\in \NN,~ x^n = 0} \normal R$.
We had a theorem: $\nil(R) = \intersect_{\mfp\in\spec(R)} \mfp$.

Definition
: For $I\normal R$, we define $\rad(I) = \theset{x\in R \suchthat \exists n,~ x^n \in I} \supseteq I$.

Fact
: $I \normal R$.
  To see this, note that for any $I \normal R$, then $\nil(R/I) \normal R = \rad(I)$.

Definition
: $I$ is a *radical ideal* iff $I = \rad(I)$.


Example
: Prime ideals are radical.
  
Definition
: Define a *closure operator* $\ell: I \mapsto \rad(I)$.
  In general, if $(X, \leq)$ is a poset, then a Moore closure operator is a map $c: X\to X$ satisfying

  1. $c(c(x)) = c(x)$
  2. $x \leq c(x)$
  3. $x\leq y \implies c(x) \leq c(y)$.

This is most often applied to $X$ the family of subsets of a set $A$ and $\leq$ subset inclusion.
Note that this doesn't completely correspond to a topological closure, since this would also require preservation of intersections.

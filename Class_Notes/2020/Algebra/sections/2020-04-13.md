## Nullstellensatz

Let $k$ be a ring (later a field) and $R_n \definedas k[t_1, \cdots, t_n]$.
If $x \in k^n$ and $f\in R_n$, we can evaluate $f$ at $x$ since $f(x) \in k$, and we thus get an evaluation map
\begin{align*}
E: R_n &\to k^{k^n}\\
f \mapsto (x\mapsto f(x))
\end{align*}

which is a ring homomorphism, where the RHS is regarded as a large direct product of rings.

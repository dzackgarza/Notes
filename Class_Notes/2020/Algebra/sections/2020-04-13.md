## Nullstellensatz

Let $k$ be a ring (later a field) and $R_n \definedas k[t_1, \cdots, t_n]$.
If $x \in k^n$ and $f\in R_n$, we can evaluate $f$ at $x$ since $f(x) \in k$, and we thus get an evaluation map
\begin{align*}
E: R_n &\to k^{k^n}\\
f \mapsto (x\mapsto f(x))
\end{align*}

which is a ring homomorphism, where the RHS is regarded as a large direct product of rings.

When can we identify polynomials (abstract elements of a ring) with the corresponding polynomial *function*?

Exercise
:   Suppose $k$ is a domain.

    a. If $k$ is infinite, then $E$ is injective but not surjective.
    b. If $k$ is finite, the $E$ is surjective but not injective.

Definition (Incidence Relation)
: Put a relation on $R \cross k^n$ where $f\sim x \iff f(x) = 0_R$.

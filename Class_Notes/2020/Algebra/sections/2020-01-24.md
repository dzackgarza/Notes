Recall: 
Prime and maximal ideals.

Fact:
If $I \normal R$ then there exists a maximal ideal $I \subset \mfm \normal R$.

Proof:
Use Zorn's lemma.

Corollary:
$\maxspec R \neq \emptyset \iff R \neq 0$.


Later:
Multiplicative avoidance, if $S \subset R$ is nonempty with $SS\subset S$, let $I \normal R$ with $I\intersect S = \emptyset$, then

a. There exists an ideal $J \supseteq I$ with $J \intersect S =\emptyset$ which is maximal with respect to being disjoint from $S$.

b. Any such ideal $J$ is prime.

Taking $S = \theset{1}$ recovers the previous fact.

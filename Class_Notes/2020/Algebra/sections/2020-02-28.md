Recall: radicals, nilradical, and now the Jacobson radical.

Definition
: $\mcj(R) = \intersect{\mfm \in \maxspec(R)} \mfm$.
  For a noncommutative ring, instead of intersecting just two-sided ideals, need to intersect either left ideals *or* right ideals (the intersections turn out to be equivalent).

If $R$ is finite dimensional over a field, then $\mcj(R) = 0 \iff R$ is semisimple.
By Wedderburn, this happens iff $R = \prod M_{n_i}(D_i)$.

Definition
: A ring is *semiprimitive* *(or $\mcj\dash$semisimple or Jacobson-semisimple)* iff $\mcj(R) = 0$.

Proposition
: $x\in \mcj(R) \iff 1-xR \subset R\units$.

Proof
: Let $x\in \mcj(R)$ and suppose $1-xy \not\in R\units$, so $1-xy\in\mfm$ for some maximal ideal.
  But then $x\in \mfm$, so $xy \in \mfm$, so $1 = \mfm + xy \in \mfm$, a contradiction.
  
  Suppose instead that $x\not\in\mcj(R)$, so there exists some maximal such that $\generators{m, x} = R$.
  Thus for $y\in R, m\in\mfm$, we have $1 = m+xy$ so $1-xy = m \in \mfm$ and thus $1-xy \not\in R\units$.

In other words, $R\units + \mcj(R) \subset R\units$, and is the largest ideal with this property.

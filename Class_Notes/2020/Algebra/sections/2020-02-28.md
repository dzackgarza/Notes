Recall: radicals, nilradical, and now the Jacobson radical.

Definition
: $\mcj(R) = \intersect{\mfm \in \maxspec(R)} \mfm$.
  For a noncommutative ring, instead of intersecting just two-sided ideals, need to intersect either left ideals *or* right ideals (the intersections turn out to be equivalent).

If $R$ is finite dimensional over a field, then $\mcj(R) = 0 \iff R$ is semisimple.
By Wedderburn, this happens iff $R = \prod M_{n_i}(D_i)$.

Definition
: A ring is *semiprimitive* *(or $\mcj\dash$semisimple or Jacobson-semisimple)* iff $\mcj(R) = 0$.

Proposition
: $x\in \mcj(R) \iff 1-xR \subset R\units$.

Proof
: Let $x\in \mcj(R)$ and suppose $1-xy \not\in R\units$, so $1-xy\in\mfm$ for some maximal ideal.
  But then $x\in \mfm$, so $xy \in \mfm$, so $1 = \mfm + xy \in \mfm$, a contradiction.
  
  Suppose instead that $x\not\in\mcj(R)$, so there exists some maximal such that $\generators{m, x} = R$.
  Thus for $y\in R, m\in\mfm$, we have $1 = m+xy$ so $1-xy = m \in \mfm$ and thus $1-xy \not\in R\units$.

In other words, $R\units + \mcj(R) \subset R\units$, and is the largest ideal with this property.
Thus the elements are "close to zero" in the sense that it doesn't take you outside of the unit group.

Proposition (Commutative Algebra Analog of Euclid IX.20: Infinitely Many Primes)
: Let $R$ be a domain, then recall that $p\in R^\bullet$ is irreducible iff $p\not\in R\units$ and $p=xy \implies x\in R^\units$ or $y\in R^\units$.

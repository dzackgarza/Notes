Recall: radicals, nilradical, and now the Jacobson radical.

Definition
: $\mcj(R) = \intersect{\mfm \in \maxspec(R)} \mfm$.
  For a noncommutative ring, instead of intersecting just two-sided ideals, need to intersect either left ideals *or* right ideals (the intersections turn out to be equivalent).

If $R$ is finite dimensional over a field, then $\mcj(R) = 0 \iff R$ is semisimple.
By Wedderburn, this happens iff $R = \prod M_{n_i}(D_i)$.

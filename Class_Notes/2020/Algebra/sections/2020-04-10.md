Last time: prime avoidance, for $\mfp, \ts{\mfq_i} \in \spec R$, if $\mfp \subset \union \mfq_i$, then $\mfp \subset \mfq_i$ for some $\mfq_i$.

Theorem
: For $R$ Noetherian and $\mfp \subsetneq \mfq \in \spec R$, then $(\mfp, \mfq) \definedas \theset{\mfn \in \spec R \st \mfp \subsetneq \mfn \subsetneq \mfq}$ is either empty or infinite.

Proof
:   Wlog by passing from $R$ to $R/\mfp$, assume $\mfp = (0)$, and toward a contradiction assume that the theorem doesn't hold.
    Then $(\emptyset, \mfq) = \theset{\mfp_i}$, and by prime avoidance, there exists an $x\in \mfq \setminus \union \mfp_i$ and thus $\mfq$ is a minimal prime over $x$.
    By Hauptfidealsatz, $\ht(\mfq) \leq 1$, but this is a contradiction because $\ht(\mfq) \geq 2$.

Proposition (Generalized Hauptfidealsatz)
: For $R$ Noetherian, $I = \gens{x_1, \cdots, x_n} \normalneq R$, if $\mfp \in \spec R$ is minimal over $I$, then $\ht(\mfp) \leq n$.

Corollary
: If $\mfp \in \spec(R)$ for $R$ Noetherian, then $R$ needs at least $\ht(\mfp)$ generators.

> Complete intersection: minimal number of defining equations.

Last item on Noetherian rings, used to prove Nullstellensatz:

Lemma (Artin-Tate Lemma)
: If $R$ is Noetherian and $R \subset T \subset S$ with $S$ finitely generated as a $T\dash$module and finitely-generated as an $R\dash$algebra, then $T$ is finitely generated as an $R\dash$algebra.

## Boolean Rings

Definition
: A ring $R$ is *Boolean* if every element is idempotent, i.e. $x^2 = x$ for all $x\in R$.

Exercise
:   If $R$ is Boolean, then

    1. $R = R\units$,
    2. Every quotient is Boolean,
    3. Every subring is Boolean,
    4. (More interesting) every ideal is radical.

Exercise
:   Suppose $R$ is Boolean.

    1. If $R$ is a domain then $R \cong \ZZ/2\ZZ$.
    2. $\dim R = 0$

Exercise
: If $R$ is Boolean and local, then $R \cong \ZZ/2\ZZ$.

Proposition
:   For $R$ Boolean, TFAE:

    1. $R$ is finite.
    2. $R$ is Noetherian.
    3. $\spec R$ is finite.

    In any of these cases, $\qty{\ZZ/2\ZZ}^n$.

Proof
:   \hfill

    - $1\implies 2$ is clear because any finite ring is Noetherian.
    - $2 \implies 3$: using Akazuki-Kopkins, $R$ is Artinian and thus $\spec R = \maxspec R$ is finite.
    - $3\implies 1$: By a previous exercise, since $\maxspec R$ is finite, $R/\mcj(R)$ is a finite product of fields (by CRT essentially).

Summary:
Free $\implies$ projective $\implies$ flat $\implies_{R \text{ a domain }}$ torsion free.
Moreover, projective $\implies$ reflexive.

If $M, N$ are cyclic $R\dash$modules, then $\ann(M\tensor_R N) = \ann M + \ann N$.
Does this hold for every $M, N$? 
The answer is no; we have $\ann(M\tensor_R N) \supseteq \ann M + \ann N$.

Summary:
Free $\implies$ projective $\implies$ flat $\implies_{R \text{ a domain }}$ torsion free.
Moreover, projective $\implies$ reflexive.

If $M, N$ are cyclic $R\dash$modules, then $\ann(M\tensor_R N) = \ann M + \ann N$.
Does this hold for every $M, N$? 
The answer is no; we have $\ann(M\tensor_R N) \supseteq \ann M + \ann N$.
See MSE post: let $I\normal R$ and $M$ an $R\dash$module, we have $M \tensor_R R/I = M/IM$.
Is there an equality $\ann(M/IM) = \ann(M) + I$?
No, take $R = \CC[x, y]$.

Recall that an $R\dash$module is *reflexive* iff $\iota: M \to (M\dual)\dual$ is an isomorphism, where $M\dual = \hom_R(M, R)$.
This is injective for $R$ a field, and then surjective iff $R$ is finite-dimensional.
As shown in the problem sessions, finitely generated free modules are reflexive.

**Exercise:**
Show that direct summands of reflexive modules are reflexive, and $M_1 \oplus M_2$ is reflexive iff $M_i$ are reflexive.
Conclude that finitely generated projective modules are reflexive. 

Example of a projective module that is not free:
$\CC^2 = \qty{ \CC \cross 0  } \oplus \qty{ 0\cross \CC  } = \CC^2$, which is free, so the summands are projective, but not free.

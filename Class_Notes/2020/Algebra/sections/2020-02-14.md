Let $R$ be a ring and consider $K_0(R)$.

> Measures difference between f.g. projective and free modules over $R$.

Define

1. $(M(R), +) \definedas$ the commutative monoid of isomorphism classes of f.g. projective $R\dash$modules with addition given by direct sum, i.e. $[P] + [Q] = [P\oplus Q]$ with identity the zero modules.

2. $K_0(R) = G((M(R), +))$ is the group completion, which any map $M(R) \to G$ a group factors through.

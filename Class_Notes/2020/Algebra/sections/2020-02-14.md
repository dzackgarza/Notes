Let $R$ be a ring and consider $K_0(R)$.

> Measures difference between f.g. projective and free modules over $R$.

Define $(M(R), +) \definedas$ the commutative monoid of isomorphism classes of f.g. projective $R\dash$modules with addition given by direct sum, i.e. $[P] + [Q] = [P\oplus Q]$ with identity the zero modules, and $K_0(R) = G((M(R), +))$ is the group completion, which any map $M(R) \to G$ a group factors through.
Concretely, any element of $K_0(R)$ is of the form $[P] - [Q]$, where $[P_1] -[Q_1] \sim [P_2] - [Q_2]$ iff $[M] + [P_1] + [Q_2] = [M] + [P_2] + [Q_2]$ for every finitely generated projective $R\dash$ module $M$.
Note that excluding the $R$ here fails transitivity and thus doesn't yield an equivalence relation.

If $P, Q$ are finitely generated projective $R\dash$modules, then $[P] = [Q]$ iff $\exists M$ such that $P \oplus M \cong Q \oplus M$ iff there exists $N$ a finitely generated projective such that $M\oplus N \cong R^n$ for some $n$, i.e. $P \oplus R^n \cong Q\oplus R^n$.
In such a case, we say $P, Q$ are stably isomorphic.

Note that $[P] = 0$ iff $[P]$ has rank zero, or $[P] \oplus R^n \cong R^n$.
Also note that $[P] \cong [Q]$ can occur without necessarily having $P\cong Q$ as modules.

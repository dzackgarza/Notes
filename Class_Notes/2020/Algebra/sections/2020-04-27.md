Theorem (14.19)
:   A domain $R$ is integrally closed iff $R_\mfp$ is integrally closed for all $\mfp \in \spec R$ iff $R_\mfp$ is integrally closed for all $\mfm \in \maxspec R$.

> Recall that the height of a prime ideal is the supremum of lengths of chains.
> Height one corresponds to principal.

Definition
: For $R$ a Noetherian ring, $\mfp \in \spec R$ is *regular* iff $\dim_{\RR_\mfp / pR_\mfp} {\mfp R_\mfp \over \qty{\mfp R_\mfp}^2} = \ht(\mfp)$.

This corresponds to a mild nonsingularity property for varieties.

## Divisible Modules

We know that injective implies divisible, and uniquely divisible implies injective.
Fact: quotients of divisible modules are divisible

Exercise
:   If $R$ is a domain that is not a field and $M$ is a finitely-generated divisible $R\dash$module, then $M = 0$.

Proof (of exercise)
:   Claim: for any ring $R$, any nonzero f.g. $R\dash$module $M$ has a nonzero cyclic (monogenic) quotient given by modding out by all but one of the generators.
    Thus if $M$ admits a finitely generated divisible $R\dash$module, it admits a cyclic module.

    Then $M \cong R/\ann M$, and there are two cases:

    - $\ann M = 0$, in which case $M\cong R$.
      Then choosing $r\in R^\bullet\setminus R\units$, then $[r]: R\to R$ is *not* a surjection.

    - Otherwise, choose $x\in \ann(M) \setminus \theset{0}$.
      Then $\times x: R \to R$ is the same map as $\times 0: R\to R$, so it is not surjective.

Fact: there is a classification of divisible (iff injective) $\ZZ\dash$modules:

- $(\QQ, +)$, since the fraction field of any domain is divisible.
- $(\QQ/\ZZ, +) = \bigoplus_{\text{primes}} \QQ_p / \ZZ_p$, where $\QQ_p / \ZZ_p = \lim \ZZ/p^n\ZZ$.
    This is isomorphic to the group of $p$ power roots of unity.
    On the other hand, $\QQ/\ZZ$ is the group of *all* roots of unity

Fact (Classification of Divisible $\ZZ\dash$Modules: 
:   Any divisible $\ZZ\dash$module is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of

  - $(\QQ, +)$
  - $(\QQ_p/\ZZ_p, +)$

  Note that any direct sum of divisible groups is still divisible.
  Moreover, this decomposition is unique.

## Rings?

Proposition (Multiplicative Avoidance)
:   Let $S\subset R$ with $SS \subset S$, $1\in S$, $0\not\in S$.
    Define $\mci(S)  = \theset{I\normal R \suchthat I\intersect S = \emptyset}$.
    Then

    1. $\mci(S) \neq \emptyset$
    2. Every element of $\mci(S)$ is contained in a maximal element of $\mci(S)$.
    3. Every maximal element of $\mci(S)$ is prime. 

Proof
:   In parts:

    a. $(0) \in \mci(S)$ by construction.

    b. Standard Zorn's lemma argument. 

    c. Let $I \in \mci(S)$ be a maximal element, and let $x, y \in R$ such that $xy\in I$ with $x\not\in I$.
      Then $\generators{x, I} \supsetneq I$, so $S\intersect \generators{x, I} \neq \emptyset$ by maximality.

## Divisible Modules

We know that injective implies divisible, and uniquely divisible implies injective.
Fact: quotients of divisible modules are divisible

Exercise
:   If $R$ is a domain that is not a field and $M$ is a finitely-generated divisible $R\dash$module, then $M = 0$.

Proof (of exercise)
:   Claim: for any ring $R$, any nonzero f.g. $R\dash$module $M$ has a nonzero cyclic (monogenic) quotient given by modding out by all but one of the generators.
    Thus if $M$ admits a finitely generated divisble $R\dash$module, it admits a cyclic module.

    Then $M \cong R/\ann M$, and there are two cases:

    - $\ann M = 0$, in which case $M\cong R$.
      Then choosing $r\in R^\bullet\setminus R\units$, then $[r]: R\to R$ is *not* a surjection.

    - Otherwise, choose $x\in \ann(M) \setminus \theset{0}$.
      Then $\times x: R \to R$ is the same map as $\times 0: R\to R$, so it is not surjective.

Fact: there is a classification

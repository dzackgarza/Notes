Last time: $R$ is a ring, $M$ a finitely-generated $R\dash$modules, $J\normal R$.

Nakayama: 
If $M = JM$, then there exists an $x\in R$ with $x = 1 \mod (J)$ such that $xM = (0)$.

Generalized Nakayama:
$M = JM \iff J + \ann M = R$.
The reverse implication is immediate, the forward is by Nakayama.

## Injective Modules

Recall that every $R\dash$module is free $\iff R$ is a field.
What is the analogous condition for every $R\dash$module to be projective?

Last time: $R$ is a ring, $M$ a finitely-generated $R\dash$modules, $J\normal R$.

Nakayama: 
If $M = JM$, then there exists an $x\in R$ with $x = 1 \mod (J)$ such that $xM = (0)$.

Generalized Nakayama:
$M = JM \iff J + \ann M = R$.
The reverse implication is immediate, the forward is by Nakayama.

## Injective Modules

Recall that every $R\dash$module is free $\iff R$ is a field.
What is the analogous condition for every $R\dash$module to be projective?

**Exercise:**
For $R=  R_1 \cross R_2$ and $M = M_1 \cross M_2$, $M_i$ is an $R_i\dash$module.

*Answer:*
Every SES $0\to M_1 \to M_2 \to M_3 \to 0$ of $R\dash$modules splits.

Focusing on $M_2$: every submodule $M_1$ of $M_2$ is a direct summand.

**Theorem:**
For an $R\dash$module $M$, TFAE

1. Every submodule of $M$ is a direct summand.
2. $M$ is a direct sum of simple modules (semisimple).
3. $M$ is generated by its simple submodules.

**Definition:**
$M$ is simple iff $\exists 0 \subsetneq N \subsetneq_R M$.

> In this case, $M \cong R/\ann M$ (i.e. cyclic, monogenic) and the $\ann M$ is maximal.

*Proof:*
Omitted, see chapter 8 of notes.

Thus every $R\dash$module is projective iff every $R\dash$module is semisimple.

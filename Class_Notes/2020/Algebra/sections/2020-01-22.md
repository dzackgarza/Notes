Let $R$ be a ring and let $\mathcal{I} (R)$ be the set of ideals $I\normal R$. 
This algebraic structure is

- Partially ordered under inclusion
- Forms a complete lattice with $\sup$ the ideal generated by a family and $\inf$ the intersection.
- Forms a commutative monoid under $I+J$
- Forms a commutative monoid under $IJ$

For any commutative monoid $(M, +)$, there exists a group completion $G(M)$ such that

- $G(M)$ is a commutative group
- $g: M \to G(M)$ is a monoid homomorphism
- For any map $\phi: (M, +) \to (G, +)$  into a commutative group, we have the following diagram

\begin{tikzcd}
M \arrow[rr, "\forall \phi"] \arrow[rdd, "g"] &                                   & G \\
                                              &                                   &   \\
                                              & M(G) \arrow[ruu, "\exists! \Phi"] &  
\end{tikzcd}

> So $\phi$ factors through $M(G)$.

If this exists, it is unique up to unique isomorphism (as are all objects defined by universal properties).
It remains to construct it.

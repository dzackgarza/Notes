Let $R$ be a ring and let $\mathcal{I} (R)$ be the set of ideals $I\normal R$. 
This algebraic structure is

- Partially ordered under inclusion
- Forms a complete lattice with $\sup$ the ideal generated by a family and $\inf$ the intersection.
- Forms a commutative monoid under $I+J$
- Forms a commutative monoid under $IJ$

Let $R$ be a ring and let $\mathcal{I} (R)$ be the set of ideals $I\normal R$. 
This algebraic structure is

- Partially ordered under inclusion
- Forms a complete lattice with $\sup$ the ideal generated by a family and $\inf$ the intersection.
- Forms a commutative monoid under $I+J$
- Forms a commutative monoid under $IJ$

For any commutative monoid $(M, +)$, there exists a group completion $G(M)$ such that

- $G(M)$ is a commutative group
- $g: M \to G(M)$ is a monoid homomorphism
- For any map $\phi: (M, +) \to (G, +)$  into a commutative group, we have the following diagram

\begin{tikzcd}
M \arrow[rr, "\forall \phi"] \arrow[rdd, "g"] &                                   & G \\
                                              &                                   &   \\
                                              & M(G) \arrow[ruu, "\exists! \Phi"] &  
\end{tikzcd}

> So $\phi$ factors through $M(G)$.

If this exists, it is unique up to unique isomorphism (as are all objects defined by universal properties).
It remains to construct it.

Exercise:
For $(M, +)$ a commutative monoid, show that TFAE

1. There exists an injective $\iota: M \injects G$ monoid homomorphism for $G$ some commutative group.
2. The map $g: M \to G(M)$ is an injection.
3. $M$ is cancellative, i.e. $\forall x,y,z\in M$ we have $x+z = y+z \implies x = y$, i.e. the map $p_z(x) = x + z$ is injective.

> The content here is in $3 \implies 1$.

A commutative monoid is *reduced* iff $M\units = (0)$, i.e. if "$\forall m\in M\exists n $ such that $m+n = 0$" $\implies $m=0$

Example:
$(\NN, +)$ and $(\ZZ^+, \cdot)$ are cancellative and reduced.

Definition
$z\in M$ is a zero element iff $z+x = z$ for all $x\in M$

Last time: a characterization of Artinian rings, the Akizuki-Hopkins theorem

Theorem (Akizuki-Hopkins)
: $R$ is Artinian iff $R$ is Noetherian with Krull dimension 1, i.e. all primes are maximal.

Proposition
:   Suppose $(R, \mfm)$ is Noetherian and local.
    Then either

    1. $\mfm^n \gneq \mfm^{n+1}$ for all $n$, or
    2. $\mfm^n = (0)$ for some $n$.

    Moreover, (2) holds iff $R$ is Artinian.

Proof
:   If $\mfm^n = \mfm^{n+1}$ for some $n$, then by Nakayama $\mfm^n = (0)$.

    If $R$ is Artinian, then (1) can not hold, so (2) must hold.
    Conversely, if (2) holds, then $\mfm \in \nil R = \intersect_{\spec R} \mfp$, but this can only happen if $\spec R = \theset{\mfm}$ is precisely one ideal.
    But then every prime ideal is maximal.

Note that Artinian rings have finitely many maximal ideals.

Theorem (Primary Decomposition)
:   Let $R$ be a nonzero Artinian ring and suppose $\maxspec R = \theset{\mfm_i}^n$.
    Then $R = \prod_{i=1}^n \mfr_i$ where $\mfr_i \definedas R_{\mfm_i}$.

Note that for $R = \ZZ$ and $N = \prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{a_i}$, this recovers $Z/N\ZZ = \prod_{i=1}^n \ZZ/p_i^{a_i}\ZZ$.

Punchline: Artinian rings split as a product of local rings.
Modules over local rings are free, and thus simple, so this gives a local-to-global principle.

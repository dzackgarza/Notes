Last time: a characterization of Artinian rings, the Akizuki-Hopkins theorem

Theorem (Akizuki-Hopkins)
: $R$ is Artinian iff $R$ is Noetherian with Krull dimension 1, i.e. all primes are maximal.

Proposition
:   Suppose $(R, \mfm)$ is Noetherian and local.
    Then either

    1. $\mfm^n \gneq \mfm^{n+1}$ for all $n$, or
    2. $\mfm^n = (0)$ for some $n$.

    Moreover, (2) holds iff $R$ is Artinian.

Proof
:   If $\mfm^n = \mfm^{n+1}$ for some $n$, then by Nakayama $\mfm^n = (0)$.

Recall that we had mutually inverse maps $V, I$ and for $J\normal R$, we had a closure $\bar J = I(V(J))$ and $\bar S = V(I(S))$.

Hilbert's Nullstellensatz says that if $k = \bar k$, then for all $J$, we have $\bar J = \rad J$ and there is a Galois correspondence between radical ideals of $k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ and Zariski closed subset of $\AA_k^n$.
The weak Nullstellensatz gives a correspondence between maximal ideals and points of $k^n$.

For $S = \bar S = k^n$, we have $S = \union_{x\in S} \theset{x}$ and by the Galois correspondence, we find that if $J$ is radical then $J = \intersect{\mfm \supset J} \mfm$.

Definition
: A ring $R$ is *Jacobson* if every radical ideal is the intersection of the maximal ideals containing it, i.e. for all $I\normal R$ we have $\rad I = \intersect_{\mfm \supset I} \mfm$

Exercise
:   For $x\in k^n$, define $\mfm_x \definedas I(\theset{x}) = \theset{f\in R \suchthat f(x) = 0}$.

    1. Show that $\mfm = \gens{t_1 - x_1, \cdots, t_n - x_n}$ and $R/\mfm_x = k$.
    2. Show that the following map is injective:
    \begin{align*}
    I: k^n &\to \maxspec R \\
    x &\mapsto \mfm_x
    .\end{align*}
    3. Show that $I(k^n) = \theset{\mfm \in \maxspec R \suchthat R/\mfm = k}$.
    
    > Hint: consider the images of $t_1, \cdots, t_n$ in $R/\mfm$.


The following result will imply the weak nullstellensatz:

Lemma (Zariski, 1947)
:   Let $k$ be a field, $R$ a finitely generated $k\dash$algebra, $\mfm \in \maxspec R$.
    Then $[R/\mfm : k] < \infty$.
    Equivalently, if $K/k$ is a field extension that is finitely generated as a $k\dash$algebra, then $K$ is finitely generated as a $k\dash$vector space.

Proof
:   \hfill
    Case 1: $K = k(\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n)$ is algebraic.
    \
    In this case you get the obvious tower of extensions where each extension is finite, so $[K: k]$ is finite.
    \
    Case 2: $K/k$ is not algebraic.
    \
    We can choose a transcendence basis $t_1, \cdots, t_n$, and since $K$ is finitely generated as a field extension over $k$, the transcendence degree is finite.
    Then $k \subset k(t_1, \cdots, t_n) \subset K$ and $K$ is algebraic over $k(t_1, \cdots, t_n)$, so $[K: k(t_1, \cdots, t_n)] < \infty$.
    By the Artin-Tate lemma, $k(t_1, \cdots, t_n)/k$ is a finitely generated $k\dash$algebra.

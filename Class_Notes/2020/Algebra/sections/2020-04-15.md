Recall that we had mutually inverse maps $V, I$ and for $J\normal R$, we had a closure $\bar J = I(V(J))$ and $\bar S = V(I(S))$.

Hilbert's Nullstellensatz says that if $k = \bar k$, then for all $J$, we have $\bar J = \rad J$ and there is a Galois correspondence between radical ideals of $k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ and Zariski closed subset of $\AA_k^n$.
The weak Nullstellensatz gives a correspondence between maximal ideals and points of $k^n$.

For $S = \bar S = k^n$, we have $S = \union_{x\in S} \theset{x}$ and by the Galois correspondence, we find that if $J$ is radical then $J = \intersect{\mfm\subset J} \mfm$.

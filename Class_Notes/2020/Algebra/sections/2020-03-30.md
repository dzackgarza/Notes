We'll cover localization and Noetherian rings.

We'll need some local to global results.

Corollary
: If $R$ is a domain with fraction field $K$, then
    $$
    \intersect_{\mfm \in\maxspec R} R_\mfm = R
    $$

It follows from this that the analogous statement for prime ideals holds.

Proposition (7.11 in the notes)
:   Let $M_1, M_2 <_R M$ be sub $R\dash$modules of $M$, then $(M_1 :_M M_2) = \theset{x\in R \suchthat xM_2 \subseteq M_1}$ is equal to $\ann\qty{M_1 + M_2 \over M_1}$.
    So the colon is an ideal.
    Suppose that $S \subset R$ be a multiplicatively closed subset satisfying

    a. If $M$ is finitely generated, $S\inv \ann M = \ann S\inv M$.
    b. If $M_2$ is finitely generated, then $S\inv(M_1 : M_2) = (S\inv M_1: S\inv M_2)$.

Proof (of Proposition)
: Omitted, see notes.

Proof (of Corollary)
:   We want to show that $R \injects \intersect R_\mfm$.
    If $x\in K \setminus R$ and $I \definedas (R : Rx) \definedas \theset{r\in R \suchthat rx \in R}$, note that $1\not\in I$.
    Thus $I$ is a proper ideal, so let $\mfm \in \maxspec R$ with $\mfm \supset I$.
    Then $(R\mfm: R\mfm x) = I_\mfm = ? \subset \mfm R_\mfm$ which is a proper ideal in $R\mfm$.
    So $1$ is not in the colon ideal.

These colon ideals aren't the obvious thing to look at, but come up in applications to algebraic geometry and number theory.

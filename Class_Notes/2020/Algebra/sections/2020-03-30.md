# Monday March 30th

We'll cover localization and Noetherian rings.

We'll need some local to global results.

Corollary
: If $R$ is a domain with fraction field $K$, then
    $$
    \intersect_{\mfm \in\maxspec R} R_\mfm = R
    $$

It follows from this that the analogous statement for prime ideals holds.

For a $R \subset T$ a subring of a ring, the set of intermediate rings is a large/interesting class of rings.
Recall: uncountably many rings between $\ZZ$ and $\QQ$!
Taking $R$ a PID and $T$ its fraction field, a similar result will hold.

Define $I\normal R$ as the kernel of a ring morphism.
This implies that $I \subset(R, +)$ with the absorption property $RI \subset I$.
Conversely, any $I$ satisfying these two properties is the kernel of a ring morphism: namely $R \to R/I$.
This makes sense as a group morphism.
Define $xy + I = (x+I)(y+I)$.

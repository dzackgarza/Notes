Some module topics from Chapter 8.

## Noetherian and Artinian Modules

**Definition:**
A poset $(X, \leq)$ is said to satisfy the ACC or to be Noetherian iff there does not exist an infinite sequence (a chain) $\theset{x_n}$ with strict inequalities $x_1 < x_2 < \cdots$.
Equivalently, every weakly ascending chain $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \cdots$ eventually stabilizes, i.e. there exists an $N$ such that $x_N = x_{N+1} = \cdots$.

**Definition:**
Similarly, a poset satisfies the DCC or is *Artinian* iff there does not exist an infinite decreasing sequence $x_1 > x_2 > \cdots$.

**Definition:**
For $(X, \leq)$, define the order dual $(X\dual, \leq)$ where $x\leq y \in X\dual \iff y\leq x \in X$.

Proposition:
$X$ is Noetherian iff $X\dual$ is Artinian.

**Lemma:**
The ACC holds iff every nonempty subset has a maximum (and similarly the DCC with minimums).

> Proof: Otherwise use AOC to pick elements $x_i$; if $x_i$ isn't the maximum then there is some $x_{i+1} > x_i$, and this yields an infinite ascending chain iff no maximum.

Let $M$ be an $R\dash$module, and define $\mathrm{Sub}_R M = \theset{(R\dash\text{submodules of } M, \leq)}$.

**Lemma:**
$M$ is Noetherian $\iff$ every submodule $N\leq M$ is finitely generated.

*Proof:*
Apply DCC.

Exercise:
Let $M' \subset M$ and $q: M \to M/M'$.
Let $N_1 \subset N_2 \subset M$ such that

- $N_1 \intersect M' = N_2 = M'$, and
- $q(N_1) = q(N_2)$.

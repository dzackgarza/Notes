Some module topics from Chapter 8.

## Noetherian and Artinian Modules

**Definition:**
A poset $(X, \leq)$ is said to satisfy the ACC or to be Noetherian iff there does not exist an infinite sequence (a chain) $\theset{x_n}$ with strict inequalities $x_1 < x_2 < \cdots$.
Equivalently, every weakly ascending chain $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \cdots$ eventually stabilizes, i.e. there exists an $N$ such that $x_N = x_{N+1} = \cdots$.

**Definition:**
Similarly, a poset satisfies the DCC or is *Artinian* iff there does not exist an infinite decreasing sequence $x_1 > x_2 > \cdots$.

Definition:
For $(X, \leq)$, define the order dual $(X\dual, \leq)$ where $x\leq y \in X\dual \iff y\leq x \in X$.

Cayley's theorem: For $G$ a group, then there is a canonical injective group homomorphism $\Phi: G \injects \mathrm{Sym}(G) \cong S_n$ for $n = \abs{G}$.
The map is given by $g \mapsto g\wait$, i.e. multiplying on the left.
Is there an analog for rings?

Take a similar map:

\begin{align*}
R \to \mathrm{End}_\ZZ(R, +) \\
r \mapsto (x \mapsto rx)
.\end{align*}

Unfortunately there is no specialization for commutative groups/rings -- $\mathrm{Sym}(G)$ for example is noncommutative when $\abs {G} \geq 2$.
Similarly, even if $R$ is commutative, $\End(R, +)$ is probably not.
As per the Grothendieck philosophy, we find that all rings are a ring of functions on something -- namely themselves, since this map is injective.

All rings are commutative here, so take $R\units = \theset{x\in R \suchthat \exists y \text{s.t.} xy = 1}$.
For $R$ a group, $R\units$ is a commutative group.

Recall that if $M, N$ are $R\dash$modules then there is a map $M\cross N \mapsvia{\Phi} M\tensor_R N$ where $(r, m) \mapsto r\tensor m$ which is universal wrt the property that any bilinear map $\phi: M \cross N \to A$ factors through $\Phi$ uniquely.

We have a notion of *pullback*, where if $i:R \to S$ and $N$ is an $S\dash$module then $i^*N$ is an $R$ module with action given by composition $R \mapsvia{i} S \mapsvia{\cdot} \endo_\ZZ(N)$.

Dually, we have a notion of *base change*, where for $M$ and $R\dash$module we can form $i_* M \defined S\tensor_R M$ an $S\dash$module where $s(\sum s_i\tensor m_i) = \sum ss_i \tensor m_i$.

An $R\dash$algebra is $i:R\to S$ a ring morphism, where algebra morphisms $f: S_1 \to S_2$ are given by commutative diagrams

\begin{tikzcd}
R \arrow[rr, "i_1"] \arrow[rrdd, "i_2"] &  & S_1 \arrow[dd, "f"] \\
                                        &  &                     \\
                                        &  & S_2                
\end{tikzcd}

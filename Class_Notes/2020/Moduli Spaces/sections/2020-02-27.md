Big picture idea:
We have moduli functors, such as

\begin{align*}
F_{S'}: &(\Sch/k)\op \to \Set \\
\hilb: &S \to \text{flat subschemes of } X_S \\
\pic: &S \to \pic(X_S)/\pid(S) \\
\def: &S \to \text{flat families } / S,~ \text{smooth, finite, of genus } g
.\end{align*}


Deformation Theory:
Choose a point f the scheme representing $F_{S'}$ with $\xi_0 \in F_{gl}(\spec K)$.
Define 

\begin{align*}
F_{\text{loc}}: (\text{Artinian local schemes} / K)\op \to \set
.\end{align*}

\begin{tikzcd}
\spec(K) \arrow[rr, "i", hook] &  & \spec(A) \arrow[rr] &  & F(i)\inv(\xi_0) \arrow[rr] &  & F_{gr}(\spec K) \arrow[dd, "F(i)"] \\
                               &  &                     &  &                            &  &                                    \\
                               &  &                     &  &                            &  & F_{gl}(\spec K)                   
\end{tikzcd}

Deformation functors:
Let $F: (\Art/k) \to \Set$ where $F(k)$ is a point.
Denote $\hat{\Art}/k$ the set of complete local $k\dash$algebras.
Since $\Art/k \subset \hat{\Art} / k$, we can make extensions $\hat F$ by just taking limits:

\begin{tikzcd}
                                & \Art/k \arrow[rrr, "F"]                         &  &  & \Set \\
                                &                                                 &  &  &      \\
\lim_{\from} R/\mfm_R^n = R \in & \hat{\Art}/k \arrow[uu] \arrow[rrruu, "\hat F"] &  &  &     
\end{tikzcd}

where we define $\hat{F}(R) = \lim_{\from} F(R/\mfm_R^n)$.

Question: when is $F$ pro-representable, which happens iff $\hat F$ is representable?
In particular, we want $h_R \mapsvia{\cong} \hat F$ for $R\in \hat{\Art}/k$, so $h_R = \hom_{\hat{\Art}/k}(R, \wait) = \hom_{?}(\wait, \spec k)$.

Example:
Let $F_{gl} = \hilb_{X/k}^p$, which is represented by $H/k$.
Then $\xi_0 = F_{gl}(k) = H(k) = \theset{Z\subset X \suchthat P_z = f}$.
Then $F_{loc}$ is representable by $\hat \OO_{H/\xi_0}$.

Definition
: Given an Artinian $k\dash$algebra $A \in \Art/k$, a *thickening* is an $A' \in \Art/k$ such that $0 \to J \to A' \to A \to 0$, so $\spec A \injects \spec A'$.

Definition
: A *small thickening* is a thickening such that $0 = \mfm_{A'} J$, so $J$ becomes a module for the residue field, and $\dim_k J = 1$.

Lemma
: Any thickening of $A$, say $B\to A$, fits into a diagram:

  \begin{tikzcd}
              &  &                                      &  & 0                        &  &                                     &  &   \\
              &  &                                      &  &                          &  &                                     &  &   \\
              &  & J \arrow[rr]                         &  & A' \arrow[uu] \arrow[rr] &  & A \arrow[dd, Rightarrow] \arrow[rr] &  & 0 \\
              &  &                                      &  &                          &  &                                     &  &   \\
  0 \arrow[rr] &  & I \arrow[rr] \arrow[uu]              &  & B \arrow[uu] \arrow[rr]  &  & A \arrow[rr]                        &  & 0 \\
              &  &                                      &  &                          &  &                                     &  &   \\
              &  & I' \arrow[rr, Rightarrow] \arrow[uu] &  & I' \arrow[uu]            &  &                                     &  &   \\
              &  &                                      &  &                          &  &                                     &  &   \\
              &  & 0 \arrow[uu]                         &  & 0 \arrow[uu]             &  &                                     &  &  
  \end{tikzcd}

Proof
: We just need $I' \subset I$ with $\mfm_S I \subset J' \subset I \iff J \mfm_B = 0$.

  Choose $J'$ to be a preimage of a codimension 1 vector space in $I/\mfm_B I$.
  Thus $J = I/I'$ is 1-dimensional.

Thus any thickening $A$ can be obtained by a sequence of small thickenings.
By the lemma, in principle $F$ and thus $\hat{F}$ are determined by their behavior under small extensions.


Example
: Consider $\pic$, fix $X/k$, start with a line bundle $L_0 \in \pic(x) /\pic(k) = \pic(x)$ and the deformation functor $F(A)$ being the set of line bundles $L$ on $X_A$with $\restrictionof{L}_x \cong L_0$, modulo isomorphism.

  Note that this yields a diagram
  
  \begin{tikzcd}
  x \arrow[rr] \arrow[dd, hook] &  & k \arrow[dd, "\text{unique closed point}"] \\
                                &  &                                            \\
  X_A \arrow[rr]                &  & \spec A                                   
  \end{tikzcd}


  This is equal to $(I_x)\inv (L_0)$, where $\pic(X_a) \mapsvia{I_x} \pic(x)$.

  If $0 \to J \to A' \to A \to 0$ is a small thickening, we can identify

  \begin{tikzcd}
  0 \arrow[rr] &  & J \tensor_x \OO_{x} \cong \OO_x \arrow[rr] &  & \OO_{X_{A'}} \arrow[rr]                    &  & \OO_{X_{A}} \arrow[rr]   &  & 0 &  & \in\text{AbSheaves} \\
              &  &                                            &  &                                            &  &                          &  &   &  &                     \\
  0 \arrow[rr] &  & \OO_x \arrow[rr, "f\mapsto 1+f"]                           &  & \OO_{X_{A'}}^* \arrow[rr] \arrow[uu, hook] &  & \OO_{X_{A}}^* \arrow[rr] &  & 0 &  &                    
  \end{tikzcd}


  This yields a LES

  \begin{tikzcd}
  0 \arrow[rr]            &  & {H^0(X, \OO_x) = k} \arrow[rr] &  & {H^0(X_{A'}, \OO_{x_{A'}}^*) = {A'}^*} \arrow[rr]                                     &  & {H^0(X_{A'}, \OO_{x_{A}}^*) = A^*} \arrow[lllldd] \arrow[rr]         &  & \therefore 0 \\
                          &  &                                &  &                                                                                       &  &                                                                      &  &              \\
  \therefore 0 \arrow[rr] &  & {H^1(X, \OO_{x})} \arrow[rr]   &  & {H^1(X_{A'}, \OO_{x_{A'}}^*) = \pic(X_{A'})} \arrow[rr, "\text{restriction to } X_A"] &  & {H^1(X_{A}, \OO_{x_{A}}^*) = \pic(X_A)} \arrow[lllldd, "\text{obs}"] &  &              \\
                          &  &                                &  &                                                                                       &  &                                                                      &  &              \\
                          &  & {H^2(X, \OO_x)}                &  &                                                                                       &  &                                                                      &  &             
  \end{tikzcd}

  To understand $F$ on small extensions, we're interested in

  1. Given $L \in F_{loc}(A)$, i.e. $L$ on $X_A$ restricting to $L_0$, when does it extend to $L' \in F_{loc}(A')$?
    I.e., does there exist an $L'$ on $X_{A'}$ restricting to $L$?

  2. Provided such an extension $L'$ exists, how many are there, and what is the structure of the space of extensions?

  We have an $L\in \pic(X_A)$, when does it extend?
  By exactness, $L'$ exists iff $\text{obs}(L) = 0\in H^2(X, \OO_x)$, which answers 1.
  To answer 2, $(I_x)\inv(L)$ is the set of extensions of $L$, which is a torsor under $H^1(x, \OO_x)$. 
  Note that these are fixed $k\dash$vector spaces.

Note #3: $H^1(X, \OO_x)$ is interpreted as the *tangent space* of the functor $F$, i.e. $F_{loc}(K[\eps])$.

> Note that if $X$ is projective, line bundles can be unobstructed without the group itself being zero.


For (3), just play with $A = k[\eps]$, which yields $0 \to k \mapsvia{\eps} k[\eps] \to k \to 0$, then 

\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[rr] &  & {H^1(X, \OO_x)} \arrow[rr] &  & {H^1(X_{k[\eps]}, \OO_{k[\eps]}^*)} \arrow[rr, "I_x"] &  & {H^1(X, \OO_x^*)} \arrow[ll, bend right=49] \\
             &  &                            &  & {(I_x)\inv(L_0) \in \pic(X_{k[\eps]})}                &  & L_0 \in \pic(x)                            
\end{tikzcd}

i.e., there is a canonical trivial extension $L_0[\eps]$.

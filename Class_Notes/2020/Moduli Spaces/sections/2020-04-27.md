## Principle of Galois Cohomology

Let $\ell/k$ a galois extension and $X/k$ some "object" for which it makes sense to associate another object over $\ell$.
We'll prove that there's a correspondence
\begin{align*}
\correspond{\ell/k twisted forms Y of X/k}/\sim \to H^1(\ell/k, \aut(X/\ell))
.\end{align*}

Example:
Take $\PGL(n ,\ell) = \GL(n ,\ell) / \ell\units$.

1. $X = \PP^{n-1}/k$, then $H^1(\ell/k, \PGL(n, \ell)$ parameterizes twisted forms of $\PP^{n-1}$, e.g. for $n=2$ twisted forms of $\PP^1$ and plane curves.

2. $X = M_n(k)$ the algebra of $n\times n$ matrices.
  Then by a theorem (Skolern-Noether) $\aut(M_n(k)) = \PGL(n, k)$.
  Thus $H^1(\ell/k, \PGL(n, k))$ also parameterizes twisted forms of $M_n(k)$ in the category of unital (not necessarily commutative) $k\dash$algebras.
  These are exactly central simple algebras $A/k$ where $\dim_k A = n^2$ with center $Z(A) = k$ with no nontrivial two-sided ideals.

  By taking $\ell = k\sep$, we get a correspondence
  \begin{align*}
  \correspond{CSAs A/k of degree n} \iff \correspond{Severi-Brauer varieties of dimension n-1}
  .\end{align*}

  Taking $n=2$ we obtain
  \begin{align*}
  \correspond{quaternion algebras A/k} \iff \correspond{Genus 0 curves \ell/k}
  .\end{align*}

The Weil Descent Criterion:
Fix $\ell/k$ finite galois with $g = \aut(\ell/k)$.

1. $X/k \to X/\ell$ with a $g\dash$action.
2. What additional data on an $\ell\dash$variety $Y/\ell$ do we need in order to "descend the base" from $\ell$ to $k$?

For $\sigma \in g$, write $\ell^\sigma$ to denote $\ell$ given the structure of an $\ell\dash$algebra via $\sigma: \ell \to \ell^\sigma$.
If $X/\ell$ is a variety, $X^\sigma / \ell$ 

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
X^\sigma\ar[dr, dotted] \ar[r]\ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
\spec \ell^\sigma \ar[r, "f"] & \spec \ell
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

where $f$ is the map induced on $\spec$ by $\sigma$.

We can also think of these on defining equations:
\begin{align*}
X &= \spec \ell[t_1, \cdots, t_n] / \gens{p_1, \cdots, p^n} \\
X^\sigma &= \spec \ell[t_1, \cdots, t_n] / \gens{\sigma_{p_1}, \cdots, \sigma{p^n}} \\
.\end{align*}

For $X/k, X/\ell$, we canonically identify $X$ with $X^\sigma$ by the map $f_\sigma: X \mapsvia{\cong} X^\sigma$, a canonical isomorphism of $\ell\dash$varieties.
We thus have
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
X \ar[r, "f_\sigma"] \ar[rr, bend left, "f_{\sigma \tau}"] & X^\sigma \ar[r, "f_\sigma"] & X^{\sigma \tau}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

under a "cocycle condition" $f_{\sigma \tau} = {}^\sigma f_\tau \circ f_\sigma$.

Theorem (Weil)
: Given $Y/\ell$ quasi-projective and $\forall \sigma \in g$ we have descent datum $f_\sigma: Y\mapsvia{\cong} Y^\sigma$ satisfyting the above cocycle condition, and there exists a unique $X/k$ such that $X/\ell \mapsvia{\cong} Y/\ell$ and the descent data coincide.

Application:
Let $X/k$ be a quasiprojective variety and $Y/k$ and $\ell/k$ twisted form.
Then $a_0 \in Z' (\ell/k, \aut X)$.

Conversely, let $a_0$ be such a cocycle and $\theset{s_\sigma: X\to X^\sigma}$ be descent datum attached to $X$.
Define twisted descent datum $g_\sigma \definedas f_\sigma \circ a_\sigma$ from
\begin{align*}
X /\ell\mapsvia{a_\sigma} X/\ell \mapsvia{f_\sigma} X^\sigma / \ell
.\end{align*}

Check that $g_\sigma$ satisfies the cocycle condition, so by Weil uniquely determines a ($k\dash$model) $Y/k$ of $X/\ell$.


Let $G/k$ be a smooth algebraic group and $X/k$ a torsor under $G$.
Then $\Aut(G) \supset \aut_{G\dash\text{torsor}} (G) = G$, since in general the translations will only be a subgroup of the full group of automorphisms.

Then
\begin{align*}
H^!(\ell/k, G) \to H^1(\ell/k, \aut G)
\end{align*}
defines a twisted form $X$ of $G$.

How do you descend the torsor structure? Possible not covered in Bjoern's book!
This requires expressing the descent data more functorially -- see the book on Neron models.

## The Cohomology Theory

Motivation: let $G/k$ be a smooth connected commutative algebraic group where $\char k$ does not divide $n$, so the map $[n]: G \to G$ is an isogeny.
Then
\begin{align*}
0 \to G[n](K\sep) \to G(k\sep) \mapsvia{[n]} G(k\sep) \to 0
\end{align*}
is a SES of $g = \aut(k\sep/k)\dash$modules.

Claim:
Taking the associated cohomology sequence yields the Kummer sequence:
\begin{align*}
0 \to G(k) / nG(k) \to H^1(k, G[n]) \to H^1(k, G)[n] \to 0
\end{align*}
where the RHS is the Weil-Chatalet group and the LHS is the Mordell-Weil group.

For $g$ a profinite group, a commutative discrete $g\dash$group is by definition a $g\dash$module.
These form an abelian category with enough injectives, so we can take right-derived functors of left-exact functors.
We will consider the functor 
$$
A \mapsto A^g \definedas \theset{x\in A \suchthat \sigma x = x ~\forall \sigma\in g}
,$$
then define $H^i(g, A)$ to be the $i$th right-derived functor of $A \mapsto A^\sigma$.
This is abstractly defined by taking an injective resolution, applying the functor, then taking cohomology.

A concrete description is given by $C^n(g, A) = \map(g^n, A)$ with
\begin{align*}
d: C^n(g, A) \to C^{n+1}(g, A) \\
(df)(\sigma_1, \cdots, \sigma_{n+1} \definedas \sigma_1 f(\sigma_2, \cdots, \sigma_{n+1})
+ \sum_{i=1}^n (-1) f(\sigma _1, \cdots, \sigma_{i-1}, \sigma_i, \sigma_{i+1}, \cdots, \sigma_{n+1}) + (-1)^{n+1} f(\sigma_1, \cdots, \sigma_n)
.\end{align*}

Then $d^2 = 0$, $H^n$ is kernels mod images, and this agrees with $H^1$ as defined before with $H^0 = A^g$.
We'll see that that $H^i(g, A) = \directlim_{U} G^i(g/U, A^U)$.

If $g$ is finite, $A$ is a $g\dash$module iff $A$ is a $\ZZ[g]\dash$module, and thus $A^g = \hom_{\ZZ[g]\dash\text{mod}}(\ZZ, A)$ where $\ZZ$ is equipped with a trivial $g\dash$action.
We can thus think of $H^i(g, A) = \ext^i_{\ZZ[g]}(\ZZ, A)$.

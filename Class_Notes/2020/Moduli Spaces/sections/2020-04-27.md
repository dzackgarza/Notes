## Principle of Galois Cohomology

Let $\ell/k$ a galois extension and $X/k$ some "object" for which it makes sense to associate another object over $\ell$.
We'll prove that there's a correspondence
\begin{align*}
\correspond{\ell/k twisted forms Y of X/k}/\sim \to H^1(\ell/k, \aut(X/\ell))
.\end{align*}

Example:
Take $\PGL(n ,\ell) = \GL(n ,\ell) / \ell\units$.

1. $X = \PP^{n-1}/k$, then $H^1(\ell/k, \PGL(n, \ell)$ parameterizes twisted forms of $\PP^{n-1}$, e.g. for $n=2$ twisted forms of $\PP^1$ and plane curves.

2. $X = M_n(k)$ the algebra of $n\times n$ matrices.
  Then by a theorem (Skolern-Noether) $\aut(M_n(k)) = \PGL(n, k)$.
  Thus $H^1(\ell/k, \PGL(n, k))$ also parameterizes twisted forms of $M_n(k)$ in the category of unital (not necessarily commutative) $k\dash$algebras.
  These are exactly central simple algebras $A/k$ where $\dim_k A = n^2$ with center $Z(A) = k$ with no nontrivial two-sided ideals.

  By taking $\ell = k\sep$, we get a correspondence
  \begin{align*}
  \correspond{CSAs A/k of degree n} \iff \correspond{Severi-Brauer varieties of dimension n-1}
  .\end{align*}

  Taking $n=2$ we obtain
  \begin{align*}
  \correspond{quaternion algebras A/k} \iff \correspond{Genus 0 curves \ell/k}
  .\end{align*}

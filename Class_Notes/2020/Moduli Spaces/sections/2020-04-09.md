Let $F: \art/k \to \sets$ be a deformation functor with an obstruction theory.
Then H1-H3 imply the existence of a miniversal family, and gives us some control on the hull $h_R \to F$, namely
\begin{align*}
\dim \def(F) \geq \dim R \geq \dim \def(F) - \dim \obs(F)
.\end{align*}

In particular, if $\obs(F) = 0$, then $R \cong k[[\def(F)\dual]] = k[[ t_F\dual ]]$.

Example:
Let $M = \hilb_{\PP^n/k}^{dt + (1-g)}$ where $k=\bar k$, and suppose $[Z] \in M$ is a smooth point.

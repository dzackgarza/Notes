For $k=\bar k$, and $C/k$ a smooth projective curve, then $\hilb_{C/k}^n = \sym^n C$.
For$X/k$ a smooth projective  *surface*, $\hilb_{X/k}^n \neq \sym^n X$.
There is a map (the Hilbert-Chow map) 

\begin{align*}
\hilb_{X/k}^n &\to \sym^n X \\
Z &\mapsto \supp(Z) \\
U  = \text{reduced subschemes} &\mapsto U' = \text{ reduced multisets } \\
\PP^1 &\mapsto (x, x)
.\end{align*}


Example: 
Consider $\AA^2 \cross \AA^2$ under the $\ZZ/2\ZZ$ action $( (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) \mapsto ((x_2, y_2), (x_1, y_1))$.
Then $(\AA^2)^2 / \ZZ/2 = \spec k[x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2]^{\ZZ/2} = \spec k[x_1 x_2, y_1 y_2, x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2, x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1, \cdots]$ with a bunch of symmetric polynomials adjoined. 

Example:
Take $\AA^2$ and consider $\hilb_{\PP^2}^3$.
If $I$ is a monomial ideal in $\AA^2$, there is a nice picture.
We can identify the tangent space $T_Z \hilb_{\PP^2}^n = \hom_{\OO_{\PP^2}} ( I_2, \OO_Z) = \bigopus \hom(I_{Z_i}, \OO_{Z_i})$ if $Z = \disjoint Z_i$. 
If $I$ is supported at 0, then we can identify the ideal with the generators it leaves out.

Example: $I = (x^2, xy, y^2)$:

Example: $I = (x^6, x^2y^2, xy^4, y^5)$:

Example: $I = (x^2, y)$.
Let $e=x^2, f = y$.

By comparing rows to columns, we obtain a relation $ye = x^2 f$.
Write $\OO = \theset{1, x}$, then note that this relation is trivial in $\OO$ since $y=x^2=0$.

Thus $\hom(I, \OO) = \hom(k^2, k^2)$ is 4-dimensional.

Note that $C/k$ for curves is an important case to know.
Take $Z \subset C \cross C^n$, then quotient by the symmetric group $S^n$ (need to show this can be done), then $Z/S^n \subset C \cross \sym^n C$ and composing with the functor $\hilb$ represents yields a map $\sym^n C \to \hilb_{C/k}^n$.
This is bijective on points, and a tangent space computation shows it's an isomorphism.

Example:
Consider the nodal cubic in $\PP^2$:

![Image](figures/2020-02-06-13:01.png)\

Consider the open subscheme $V \subset \hilb_{C/k}^2$ of points $z \subset U$ for $U \subset C$ open.

We can normalize:

![Image](figures/2020-02-06-13:03.png)\

This yields a map fro $\PP^1 \setminus\text{2 points}$.
This gives us a stratification, i.e. a locally closed embedding $(\text{z supported on U}) \disjoint (\text{1 point at p}) \disjoint (\text{both points at p}) \to \hilb_{C/k}^2$.

The first locus is given by the complement of two lines: 
![Image](figures/2020-02-06-13:08.png)\

The third locus is given by arrows at $p$ pointing in any direction, which gives a copy of $\PP^1$.

The second is $\PP^1$ minus two points.

Above each point is a nodal cubic with two marked points, and moving the base point towards a line correspond to moving one of the points toward the node:

More precisely, we're considering the cover $\PP^1 \setminus\text{2 points} \to C$ and thinking about ways in which two points and approach the missing points.
These give specific tangent directions at the node on the cubic, depending on how this approach happens -- either both points approach missing point #1, both approach missing point #2, or each approach a separate missing point.

> Useful example to think about. Not normal, reduced, but glued in a weird way.
> Possibly easier to think about: cuspidal cubic.

# Representability

**Definition:**
A coherent sheaf $F$ on $\PP_k^n$ for $k$ a field is $m\dash$regular iff $H^i(F(m-i)) = 0$ for all $i> 0$.

**Proposition:**
For every Hilbert polynomial $P$, there exists some $m_0$ depending on $P$  such that any $Z \subset \PP^n_k$ with $P_Z = P$ satisfies $I_Z$ is $m\dash$regular.

*Remark 1:*
$F$ is $m\dash$ regular iff $\bar F = F \cross_{\spec k} \spec \bar k$ is $m\dash$regular.

Remark 2:
The $m_0$ produced does not depend on $k$.

Lemma:
For $m_0 = m_0(P)$ and $N = N(P)$, we have an embedding as a subfunctor 

\begin{align*}
\hilb_{\PP^m_\ZZ}^P \to \Gr(N, H^0( \PP^n_\ZZ, \OO(m_0)  )\dual )
.\end{align*}


For any $Z \subset \PP^n_S$ flat over $S$ with $P_{Z_s} = P$ for all $s\in S$ points, we want to send this to 
$0\to R\dual \to \OO_s \tensor H^0(\PP^n_\ZZ, \OO(m_0))\dual \to Q \to 0$ or equivalently
$0 \to Q\dual \to \OO_s \tensor H^0(\PP^n_\ZZ, \OO(m_0)) \to R \to 0$
with $R$ locally free.


So instead of the quotient $Q$ being locally free, we can ask for the sub $Q\dual$ to be locally free instead, which is a weaker condition.

We thus send $Z$ to $0 \to \pi_{s*} I_Z(m_0) \to \pi_{s*} \OO_{\PP^n_s}(m_0) = \OO_s \tensor H^0(\PP^n, \OO(m_0))$ which we obtain by taking the pushforward from this square:

\begin{tikzcd}
\PP^n_s \arrow[dd, "\pi_s"] \arrow[rr] &  & \PP^n_Z \arrow[dd] \\
                                       &  &                    \\
S \arrow[rr]                           &  & \spec \ZZ         
\end{tikzcd}

We have a sequence $0 \to I_Z(m_0) \to \OO(m_0) \to \OO_Z(m_0) \to 0$.

> Review base-change!

This we get a sequence $0 \to \pi_{s*}I_Z(m_0) \to \pi_{s*}\OO(m_o) \to \pi_{s*} \OO_Z(m_0) \to R^1 \pi_{s*}I_Z(m_0) \to \cdots$.

*Step 1:* 
$R^1\pi_* I_Z(m_0) = 0$.

By base change, it's enough to show that $H^1(Z_s, I_{Z_s}(m_0)) = 0$.
This follows by $m_0\dash$regularity.

*Step 2:*
$\pi_{s*}I_Z(m_0)$ and $\pi_{s*} \OO_Z(m_0)$ are locally free.

For all $i>0$, we have 

- $R^i \pi_{s*} I_Z(m_0) = 0$ by $m_0\dash$regularity,
- $R^9 \pi_{s*} \OO(m_0) = 0$ by base change,
- and thus $R^i \pi_{s*} \OO_Z(m_0) = 0$.

*Step 3:*
$\pi_{s*}I_Z(m_0)$ has rank $N = N(P)$.

Again by base change, there is a map $\pi_* I_Z(m_0) \tensor k(s) \to H^0(Z_S, I_{Z_s}(m_0))$ which we know is an isomorphism.
Because $h^i ( I_{Z_S}(m_0) ) = 0$ for $i>0$ by $m\dash$regularity and $h^0(I_{Z_S}(m_0)) = P_\OO(m_0) - P_{\OO_{Z_s}}(m_0) = P_\OO (m_0) - P(m_0)$.

This yields a well-defined functor $\hilb_{\PP^n_\ZZ}^P \to \Gr(N, H^0(\PP^n, \OO(m_0))\dual )$.

Let $k$ be a field, $X/k$ projective, then the $k\dash$points $\hilb_{X/k}^P(k)$ corresponds to closed subschemes $Z\subset X$ with hilbert polynomial $P_z = P$.
Given a $P$, we want to understand the local structure of $\hilb_{X/k}^p$, i.e. diagrams of the form
\begin{tikzcd}
                                        &  &                                               &  & \hilb_{X/k}^P \arrow[dd] \\
                                        &  &                                               &  &                          \\
\spec(k) \arrow[rrrruu, "p"] \arrow[rr] &  & \spec(A) \arrow[rruu, "?", dashed] \arrow[rr] &  & \spec(k)                 \\
                                        &  &                                               &  &                          \\
                                        &  & A/k \text{ Artinian local} \arrow[uu]         &  &                         
\end{tikzcd}

Example
: For $A = k[\eps]$, the set of extensions is the Zariski tangent space.

Definition
: Let $(\Art/k)$ be the category of local Artinian $k\dash$algebras with local residue field $k$.
  Note: these will be the types of algebras appearing in the above diagrams.

Remark
: This category has fiber coproducts, i.e. there are pushouts:
  
  \begin{tikzcd}
  C \arrow[dd] \arrow[rr] &  & A \arrow[dd, dashed] \\
                          &  &                      \\
  B \arrow[rr, dashed]    &  & A \tensor_C B       
  \end{tikzcd}

  There are also fibered products,

  \begin{tikzcd}
  A \cross_C B \arrow[rr, dashed] \arrow[dd, dashed] &  & B \arrow[dd] \\
                                                    &  &              \\
  A \arrow[rr]                                       &  & C           
  \end{tikzcd}

  Here, $A \cross_C B \definedas \theset{(a, b) \suchthat f(a) = g(b)} \subset A\cross B$.

**Theorem:**
Let $X/S$ be a projective subscheme (i.e. $X\subset \PP^n$ for some $n$).
The Hilbert functor of flat families $\hilb_{X/S}^p$ is representable by a projective $S\dash$scheme.

> Note that without a fixed $P$, this is *locally* of finite type but not finite type. 
> After fixing $P$, it becomes finite type.

*Example:*
For a curve of genus $g$, there is a smooth family $\mcc \mapsvia{\pi} S$ with $S$ finite-type over $\ZZ$ where every genus $g$ curve appears as a fiber.
I.e., genus $g$ curves form a *bounded family* (here there are only finitely many algebraic parameters to specify a curve).

> How did we construct? Take the third power of the canonical bundle and show it's very ample, so it embeds into some projective space and has a hilbert polynomial.

In fact, there is a finite type *moduli stack* $\mcm_g / \ZZ$ of genus $g$ curves.
There will be a map $S \surjects \mcm_g$, noting that $\mcc$ is not a moduli space since it may have redundancy.

> We'll use the fact that a finite-type scheme surjects onto $\mcm_g$ to show it is finite type.


*Remarks:*
1. If $X/S$ is proper, we can't talk about the Hilbert polynomial, but the functor $\hilb_{X/S}$ is still representable by a locally finite-type scheme with connected components which are proper over $S$.

2. If $X/S$ is *quasiprojective* (so locally closed, i.e. $X\injects \PP^n_S$), then $\hilb_{X/S}^P(T) \definedas \theset{z\in X_T \text{ projective, flat over S with fiberwise Hilbert polynomial P }}$ is still representable, but now by a quasiprojective scheme.

*Example:*
Length $Z$ subschemes of $\AA^1$: representable by $\AA^2$.

Upstairs: parametrizing length 1 subschemes, i.e. points.

3. If $X\subset \PP_S^n$ and $E$ is a coherent sheaf on $X$, then

\begin{align*}
\quot_{E, X/S}^{P}(T) = \theset{ j^*E \to F \to 0, \text{ over } X_T \to T,~F \text{ flat with fiberwise Hilbert polynomial  } P  }  
\end{align*}

where $T \mapsvia{g} S$ is representable by an $S\dash$projective scheme.

*Example:*
Take $E = \OO_x$, $X$ and $S$ a point, and $E$ is a vector space, then $\quot_{E/S}^P = \Gr(\rank, E)$.


> The hilbert scheme of 2 points on a surface is more complicated than just the symmetric product.

*Example:*

\begin{align*}
\qty{\AA^2}^3 &\to \qty{\AA^2}^2 \\
\supseteq \Delta\definedas \Delta_{01} \cross \Delta{02} &\to \qty{\AA^2}^2
\end{align*}

where $\Delta_{ij}$ denote the diagonals on the $i, j$ factors.
Here all associate points of $\Delta$ dominate the image, but it is not flat.
Note that if we take the complement of the diagonal in the image, then the restriction $\Delta' \to \qty{\AA^2}^2\setminus D$ is in fact flat.

Mumford example:
The Hilbert scheme may have nontrivial scheme structure, i.e. this will be a "nice" hilbert scheme with is generally not reduced.
We will find a component $H$ of a $\hilb_{\PP^3_C}^P$ whose generic point corresponds to a smooth irreducible $C\subset \PP^3$ which is generically non-reduced.

## Cubic Surfaces

> See Hartshorne Chapter 5.

Let $X\subset \PP^3$ be a smooth cubic surface, then $\OO(1)$ on $\PP^3$ restricts to a divisor class $H$ of a hyperplane section, i.e. the associated line bundle $\OO_x(H) = \OO_x(1)$.

Two important facts:

1. $X$ is the blowup of $\PP^2$ minus 6 points (replace each point with a curve).
There is thus a blowdown map $X \mapsvia{\pi} \PP^2$.

![Image](figures/2020-02-18-13:07.png)\

Let $\ell = \pi^*(\text{line})$, then a fact is that $3\ell - E_1 -\cdots - E_6$ (where $E_i$ are the curves about the $p_i$) is very ample and embeds $X$ into $\PP^3$ as a cubic.

2. Every smooth cubic surface $X$ has *precisely* 27 lines.
Any 6 pairwise skew lines arise as $E_1, \cdots, E_6$ as in the previous construction.

Take an $X$ and a line $L\subset X$.
Consider any $C$ in the linear system $\abs{4H + 2L}$.
Fact: $\OO(4H + 2L)$ is very ample, so embeds into a big projective space, and thus $C$ is smooth and irreducible by Bertini.

Then the hilbert polynomial of $C$ is of the form $at + b$ where $b = \chi(\OO_c)$, the Euler characteristic of the structure sheaf of $C$, and $a = \deg C$.
So we'll compute these.

We have $\deg C = H \cdot C$ (intersection) $= H \cdot(4H + 2L) = 4H^2 + 2H\cdot L = 4\cdot 3 + 2 = 14$.
The intersections here correspond to taking hyperplane sections, intersecting with $X$ to get a curve, and counting intersection points:

![Image](figures/2020-02-18-13:14.png)\

In general, for $X$ a surface and $C\subset X$ a smooth curve, then $\omega_C = \omega_X(C)\mid_C$.
Since $X\subset \PP^3$, we have $\omega_X = \omega_{\PP^3}(X) \mid_X = \OO(-4) \oplus \OO(3)\mid_X = \OO_X(-1) = \OO_X(-H)$.
We also have $\omega_C = \omega_X(C)\mid_X = \qty{ \OO_X(-H) \oplus \OO_X(4H + 2L)   }\mid_C$, so taking degrees yields
$\deg \omega_C = C\cdot(3H + 2L) = (4H+2L)(3H+2L) = 12H^2 + 14HL + 4L^2 = 36 + 14 + (-4) = 46$.
Since this equals $2g(C) - 2$, we can conclude that the genus is given by $g(C) = 24$.

Thus $P$ is given by $14t + (1-g) = 14t - 23$.

> Good to know: moving a cubic surface moves the lines, you get a monodromy action, and the Weyl group of $E_6$ acts transitively so lines look the same.

**Claim:**
There is a flat family $Z\subset \PP^3_S$ with fiberwise hilbert polynomial $P$ of cures of this form such that the image of the map $S \to \hilb_{\PP^3}^P$ has dimension 56.

Proof:
We can compute the dimension of the space of smooth cubic surfaces, since these live in $\PP H^0(\PP^3, \OO(3))$, which has dimension ${3+3\choose 3} -1 = 19$.
Since there are 27 lines, the dimension of the space of such cubics with a choices of a line is also 19.
Choose a general $C$ in the linear system $\abs{4H + 2L}$ will add $\dim \abs{4H + 2L} = \dim \PP H^0(x, \OO_x(C))$.
We have an exact sequence

\begin{align*}
0 \to \OO_X \to \OO_X(C) \to \OO_C(C) \to 0 \\
H^0\qty{ 0 \to \OO_X \to \OO_X(C) \to \OO_C(C) \to 0 } \\
.\end{align*}

Since the first $H^0$ vanishes (?) we get an isomorphism.

By Riemann-Roch, we have $\deg \OO_C(C) = C^2 = (4H+2L)^2 = 16H^2 + 16 HL + 4L^2 = 64 - 4 = 60$.
We can also compute $\chi(\OO_C(C)) = 60 - 23 = 37$.
We have $h^0(\OO_C(C)) - h^1(\OO_C(C)) =  h^0(\OO_C(C)) - h^0(\omega_C(-C))) = 2(23) - 60 < 0$, so there are no sections.

So $\dim \abs{4H + 2L} =  37$.
Thus letting $S$ be the space of cubic surfaces $X$, a line $L$, and a general $C \in \abs{4H + 2L}$, $\dim S = 56$.
We get a map $S \to \hilb_{\PP^3}^P$, and we need to check that the fibers are 0-dimensional (so there are no redundancies).

We then just need that every such $C$ lies on a unique cubic.
Why does this have to be the case?
If $C \subset X, X'$ then $C \subset X\intersect X'$ is degree 14 curve sitting inside a degree 6 curve, which can't happen.

Thus if $H$ is a component of $\hilb_{\PP^3}^P$ containing the image of $S$, the $\dim H \geq 56$.

**Claim 3:**
For any $C$ above, we have $\dim T_C H = 57$.

When the subscheme is smooth, we have an identification with sections of the normal bundle $T_C H = H^0(C, N_{C/\PP^3})$.
There's an exact sequence

\begin{align*}
0 \to N_{C/X} = \OO_C(C) \to N_{C/\PP^3} \to N_{X/\PP^3}\mid_C = \OO_C(x)\mid_C = \OO_C(3H)\mid_C \to 0
.\end{align*}

> Note $\omeg_C = \OO_C(3H + 2L)$.

As we computed, 

\begin{align*}
H^0(\OO_C(C)) &= 37 \\
H^1(\OO_C(C)) &= 0 \\
.\end{align*}

So we need to understand the right-hand term $H^0(\OO_C(3H))$.
By Serre duality, this equals $h^1(\omega_C(-3H)) = h^1(\OO_C(3L))$.
We get an exact sequence

\begin{align*}
0 \to \OO_X(2L-C) \to \OO_X(2L) \to \OO_C(2L) \to 0
.\end{align*}

Taking homology, we have $0\to 0 \to 1\ to 1\ to 0$.

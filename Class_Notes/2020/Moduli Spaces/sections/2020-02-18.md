**Theorem:**
Let $X/S$ be a projective subscheme (i.e. $X\subset \PP^n$ for some $n$).
The Hilbert functor of flat families $\hilb_{X/S}^p$ is representable by a projective $S\dash$scheme.

> Note that without a fixed $P$, this is *locally* of finite type but not finite type. 
> After fixing $P$, it becomes finite type.

*Example:*
For a curve of genus $g$, there is a smooth family $\mcc \mapsvia{\pi} S$ with $S$ finite-type over $\ZZ$ where every genus $g$ curve appears as a fiber.
I.e., genus $g$ curves form a *bounded family* (here there are only finitely many algebraic parameters to specify a curve).

> How did we construct? Take the third power of the canonical bundle and show it's very ample, so it embeds into some projective space and has a hilbert polynomial.

In fact, there is a finite type *moduli stack* $\mcm_g / \ZZ$ of genus $g$ curves.
There will be a map $S \surjects \mcm_g$, noting that $\mcc$ is not a moduli space since it may have redundancy.

> We'll use the fact that a finite-type scheme surjects onto $\mcm_g$ to show it is finite type.


*Remarks:*
If $X/S$ is proper, we can't talk about the Hilbert polynomial, but the functor $\hilb_{X/S}$ is still representable by a locally finite-type scheme with connected components which are proper over $S$.

If $X/S$ is *quasiprojective* (so locally closed, i.e. $X\injects \PP^n_S$), then $\hilb_{X/S}^P(T) \definedas \theset{z\in X_T \text{ projective, flat over $S$, fiberwise ? }}$

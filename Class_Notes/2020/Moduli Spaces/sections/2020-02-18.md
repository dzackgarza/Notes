Let $X/S$ be a projective subscheme (i.e. $X\subset \PP^n$ for some $n$).
The Hilbert functor of flat families $\hilb_{X/S}^p$ is representable by a projective $S\dash$scheme.

Example:
For a curve of genus $g$, there is a smooth family $\mcc \mapsvia{\pi} S$ with $S$ finite-type over $\ZZ$ where every genus $g$ curve appears as a fiber.
I.e., genus $g$ curves form a *bounded family* (here there are only finitely many algebraic parameters to specify).

> How did we construct? Take the third power of the canonical bundle and show it's very ample, so it embeds into some projective space and has a hilbert polynomial.

In fact, there is a finite type *moduli stack* $\mcm_g / \ZZ$ of genus $g$ curves.
There will be a map $S \surjects \mcm_g$, noting that $\mcc$ is not a moduli space since it may have redundancy.

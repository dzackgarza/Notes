## Abstract Deformations

Let $X_0$ be smooth and consider the deformation functor
\begin{align*}
F : \art/k &\to \sets \\
A &\mapsto X/A \text{flat (and thus smooth) with a closed embedding } i: X_0 \injects X \text{ s.t. } i\tensor k \text{ is an iso }
.\end{align*}

Then $F$ has an obstruction theory with

- $\def(F) = H^1(X_0, T_0)$ of the tangent bundle
- $\obs(F) = H^2(X_0, T_0)$.

Additionally assume $X_0$ is smooth and projective, which will force the above cohomology groups to be finite-dimensional over $k$.

Key points:

- All deformations of smooth affine schemes are trivial
- Automorphisms of a deformation $X/A$ which are the identity on $X_0$ are $\id + \delta$ for $\delta$ a derivation in $\Der_k(\OO_{X_0}) = \hom_{\OO_{X_0}}(\Omega_{X_0/k}, \OO_{X_0})$.

Suppose we have a small thickening $k \to \AA^1 \to \AA$ and $X/\AA$ with an affine cover $X_\alpha$ of $X$.
This comes with gluing information $\phi_{\alpha\beta}: X_{\alpha\beta} \to X_{\beta\alpha} = X_\alpha \intersect X_\beta$.
These maps satisfy a cocycle condition

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
X_{\alpha\beta} \intersect X_{\alpha\gamma} \ar[rr]\ar[rd] & & X_{\gamma\alpha} \intersect X_{\gamma\beta}\ar[ld] \\
& X_{\beta\alpha} \intersect X_{\beta\gamma} &
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Question: can we extend this to $X'/\AA$?
We have $X_\alpha \cong X_\alpha\red \cross \AA$?

Choose $\phi'_{\alpha\beta}$ such that
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
X'_{\alpha\beta} \ar[r, \phi'_{\alpha\beta}] & X'_{\beta\alpha} = X_{\beta\alpha}\red \cross \AA \\
X_{\alpha\beta}\ar[u, hook] \ar[r, \phi_{\alpha\beta}] & X_{\beta\alpha} \ar[u, hook]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

We need $\phi'_{\alpha\beta}$ to satisfy the cocycle condition in order to glue.
We want the following map to be the identity: $(\phi'_{\alpha\gamma})\inv \phi'_{\beta\gamma} \phi'_{\alpha\beta}$.
This is an automorphism of $X'_{\alpha\beta} \intersect X'_{\alpha\beta}$ and is thus the identity in $\aut(X_{\alpha\beta} \intersect X_{\alpha\gamma})$.
So it makes sense to talk about $\delta_{\alpha\beta\gamma} \definedas (\phi'_{\alpha\gamma})\inv \phi'_{\beta\gamma} \phi'_{\alpha\beta} - \id \in M^0(T_{X\red_{\alpha\beta\gamma}})$.

    1. $\delta_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ is a $2\dash$cocycle for $T_{X_0}$, so it has trivial boundary in terms of Cech cocycles.
      Thus $[\delta_{\alpha\beta\gamma}] \in H^2(T_{X_0})$.
    2. The class $[\delta_{\alpha\beta\gamma}]$ is independent of choice of $\phi'_{\alpha\beta}$, i.e. $\phi'_{\alpha\beta} - \phi_{\alpha\beta}'' \in H^0(T_X_{\alpha\beta})$ gives a coboundary $\eta$ and thus $\delta = \delta' + \eta$.
      This yields $\obs(X) \in H^2(T_{X_0})$.
    3. $\obs(X) = 0 \iff X$ lifts to some $X'$ (i.e. a lift exists)

For the sufficiency, we have $\delta_{\alpha\beta\gamma} = \bd \eta_{\alpha\beta} \in H^0(T_{X_{\alpha\beta}})$.
Let $\phi_{\alpha\beta}'' = \phi_{\alpha\beta}' - \eta_{\alpha\beta}$, the claim is that $\phi_{\alpha\beta}''$ satisfies the gluing condition.

This covers the obstruction, so now we need to show that the set of lifts is a torsor for the action of the deformation space $\def(F) = H^1(T_{X_0})$.
From an $X'$, we obtain $X_{\alpha\beta}' \mapsvia{\phi_{\alpha\beta}'} X_{\beta\alpha}'$ where the LHS is isomorphic to $(X_{\alpha\beta}')\red \cross \AA^r$?
Given $\eta_{\alpha\beta} \in H^0(T_{X_{\alpha\beta}})$, then $\phi'_{\alpha\beta} + \eta_{\alpha\beta} = \phi_{\alpha\beta}''$ is another such identification.

Exercise

    1. $\bd \eta_{\alpha\beta} = 0$.
    2. Given an $X'$ and 1-coboundary $\eta$, we get a new lift $X'' = X' + \eta$.
      If $[\eta] = [\eta'] \in H^1(T_{X_0})$, then $X' + \eta \cong X' + \eta'$.

By construction, $(X' + \eta)_\alpha \cong (X' + \eta')_\alpha$, but these may not patch together.
However, if $\[\eta] = [\eta']$ then this isomorphism can be modified by by $\eps$ defined by $\eta-\eta' = \bd \eps$, and it patches.

> This kind of patching is ubiquitous -- essentially patching together local obstructions to get a global one.
> In general, there is a local-to-global spectral sequence that computes the obstruction space

## Proving Schlessinger

The Schlessinger axioms:

H1:
For any two small thickenings
\begin{align*}
A' &\to A \\
A'' &\to A
\end{align*}

we have a natural map
\begin{align*}
F(A' \cross_A A'') \to F(A') \cross_{F(A)} F(A'')
\end{align*}
and we require that this map is surjective.

> So deformations agreeing on the sub glue together.

H2:
When $(A' \to A) = (k[\eps] \to k)$ is the trivial extension, the map in H1 is an isomorphism.

> Doing things to first order is especially simple.

H3:
The tangent space of $F$ is given by $t_F = F(k[\eps])$, and we require that $\dim_k t_F < \infty$, which makes sense due to H2.

H4:
If we have two equal small thickenings $(A' \to A) = (A'' \to A)$, then the map in H1 is an isomorphism.

H4':
For $A' \to A$ small,
\begin{align*}
t_F \selfmap F(A') \to F(A)
\end{align*}
is exact in the middle and left.

> Note that the existence of this action uses H2.

Warning:
For $(R, \xi)$ a complete local ring and $\xi \in \hat F(R)$ a formal family, this is a hull $\iff$ miniversal, i.e. for $h_R \mapsvia{\xi} F$, this is smooth an isomorphism on tangent spaces.

Theorem (1, Schlesinger)
:   \hfill

    a. $F$ has a miniversal family $(R, \xi)$ with $\dim t_R < \infty$, noting that $t_R = \mfm_R / \mfm_R^2$, iff H1-H3 hold.
    b. $F$ has a universal family $(R, \xi)$ with $\dim t_R < \infty$ iff h1-H4 hold.

Theorem (2)
:   \hfill

    a. $F$ having an obstruction theory implies H1-H3.
    b. $F$ having a strong obstruction theory (exact on the left) is equivalent to H1-H4.

Some preliminary observations:

Exercise (Easy, fun, diagram chase)
: If $F$ has an obstruction theory, then H1-H3 hold.


Exercise
: An obstruction theory being exact on the left implies H4.

Exercise
: For $R$ a complete local $k\dash$algebra with $t_R$ finite dimensional has a strong obstruction theory.

Can always find a surjection from a power series ring:
\begin{align*}
S \definedas k[[t_R\dual]] \surjects R
\end{align*}

which yields an obstruction theory

- $\def = t_R$
- $\obs = I/\mfm_S I$

i.e., if $F$ is pro-representable, then it has a strong obstruction theory.

Suppose that $(R, \xi)$ is versal for $F$, this implies H1.
We get $F(A' \cross_A A'') \surjects F(A') \cross_{F(A)} F(A'')$

For versal, if we have $h_R \mapsvia{\xi} F$ smooth, we have

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
& & &  h_r \ar[d] \\
h_k \ar[r] \ar[rru] &h_A \ar[r]\ar[rru, dotted] \ar[rr, bend left, "\eta"] & h_{A'} \ar[ur, dotted]\ar[r] F
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

and we can find a lift from $h_{A''}$ as well, so we get a diagram
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
 & & F
h_{A''} \ar[r] & h_R \ar[ru] \\
h_A \ar[u] \ar[r] & h_{A'} \ar[u]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}


and thus
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
{A''} \ar[r] & R \\
A \ar[u] \ar[r] & {A'} \ar[u]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

So we get the left $\tilde \eta$ of $(\eta', \eta''$ we want from
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
h_{A' \cross_A A''} \ar[r, 'f'] \ar[rr, "\tilde\eta", bend right] & h_R \ar[r] & F
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

If $(R, \xi)$ is miniversal, then H2 holds.
We want to show that the map
\begin{align*}
F(A'' \cross_K k[\eps]) \mapsvia{\cong} ??
\end{align*}
is a bijection.

Suppose we have two maps
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
& & h_R \\
h_{A''} \ar[rru] \ar[r] & h_{A'' \cross k[\eps]} \ar[ru, bend left] \ar[r, bend left] \ar[ru, bend right] \ar[r, bend right] F \\
h_{k[\eps]} \ar[ur] \\
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Then the two lifts are in fact equal, and
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
R \ar[r, bend up] \ar[r, bend left] A'' \cross k[\eps]\ar[r]\ar[d] & k[\eps] \\
 & A'' &
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

If $(R, \xi)$ is miniversal with $t_R$ finite dimensional, then H3 holds immediately.

## Abstract Deformations

Let $X_0$ be smooth and consider the deformation functor
\begin{align*}
F : \art/k &\to \sets \\
A &\mapsto X/A \text{flat (and thus smooth) with a closed embedding } i: X_0 \injects X \text{ s.t. } i\tensor k \text{ is an iso }
.\end{align*}

Then $F$ has an obstruction theory with

- $\def(F) = H^1(X_0, T_0)$ of the tangent bundle
- $\obs(F) = H^2(X_0, T_0)$.

Additionally assume $X_0$ is smooth and projective, which will force the above cohomology groups to be finite-dimensional over $k$.

Last time:
Twisted cubics, given by $\hilb_{\PP^3_k}^{3t+1}$.

We got lower (?) bounds on the dimension by constructing families, but want an exact dimension.

Key:
Let $Z\subset X$ be a closed $k\dash$dimensional subspace.

Proposition:
For $[z] \in \hilb_{X/k}^P(k)$, we have an identification of the Zariski tangent space $T_[z] \hilb_{X/k}^P = \hom_{\OO_x}(I_z, \OO_z)$.

Say $F: (\sch/K)\op \to \sets$ is a function and let $x\in F(k)$.
There is an inclusion $i: \spec k \injects \spec k[\eps]$.
Then there is an induced map $F(\spec k [\eps]) \mapsvia{i^*} F(\spec k)$ where $T_x F \definedas (i^*)\inv(x) \mapsto x$.
So if $F$ is represented by a scheme $H/k$, then $T_x h_J = T_x H = (\mfm_x / \mfm_x^2)\dual$ over $k$.

> Will need a criterion for flatness later, esp. for Artinian thickenings.

Lemma:
Assume $A'$ is a Noetherian ring and $0 \to J \to A' \to A \to 0$ with $J^2 = 0$.
Assume we have $X' / \spec A'$, and a coherent sheaf $F'$ on $X'$, where $X'$ is Noetherian.

Then $F'$ is flat over $A'$ iff

1. $F$ is flat
2. $0 \to F\tensor_A J \to F'$ is exact.

Take the first exact sequence and tensor with $F'$ (which is right-exact), then $J \tensor_{A'} F' = J \tensor_A$ canonically.
This follows because $J = J \tensor_{A'} A$, and there is an isomorphism $J \tensor_{A'} \A' \to J \tensor_{A'} A$.
And $F = F' \tensor_{A'} A$ is a pullback of $F'$.
If flat, then tensoring is exact.

Proof:
Both conditions are necessary since pullbacks of flats are flat (1), and (2) gives the flatness condition.)

Recall that for a module over a Noetherian ring, $M/A$, $M$ is flat over $A$ iff $\tor_1^A(M, A/p) = 0$ for all prime $p$.
Reason: Tor commutes with direct limits, so $M$ is flat iff $\Tor_1^A(M, N) = 0$ for all finitely generated $N$.
Since $A$ is Noetherian, $N$ has a finite filtration $N^\cdot$ where $N_i / N_{i+1} \cong A/p_i$.
Use the fact that every ideal is contained in a prime ideal.

Take $x\in N$, this yields a map $A\to N$ which factors through $A/I$.
If we make such a filtration on $A/I$, then we can quotient $N$ by $\img f$ where $f: A/I \to N$.
Continuing inductively, the resulting filtration must stabilize.
So we can assume $N = A/I$.

Then $I$ is contained in a maximal.

Exercise:
Finish proof.
See Aatiyah Macdonald.

So it's enough to show that $\tor_1^{A'}(F', A'/p') = 0$ for all primes $p' \subset A'$.

Observation:Since $J$ is nilpotent, $J \subset p'$.
Let $p = p'/J$, this is a prime ideal.

We have an exact diagram by taking quotients:

\begin{tikzcd}
             &  &              &  & 0 \arrow[dd]             &  & 0 \arrow[dd]            &  &   \\
             &  &              &  &                          &  &                         &  &   \\
0 \arrow[rr] &  & J \arrow[rr] &  & p' \arrow[rr] \arrow[dd] &  & p \arrow[rr] \arrow[dd] &  & 0 \\
             &  &              &  &                          &  &                         &  &   \\
0 \arrow[rr] &  & J \arrow[rr] &  & A' \arrow[rr] \arrow[dd] &  & A \arrow[rr] \arrow[dd] &  & 0 \\
             &  &              &  &                          &  &                         &  &   \\
             &  &              &  & A'/p' \arrow[dd]         &  & A/p \arrow[dd]          &  &   \\
             &  &              &  &                          &  &                         &  &   \\
             &  &              &  & 0                        &  & 0                       &  &  
\end{tikzcd}

So we can tensor with $F'$ everywhere, and get a map from kernels to cokernels using the snake lemma:

\begin{tikzcd}
             &  &                                                                  &  & 0 \arrow[dd]                                     &  & {\tor(A, F) = 0} \arrow[dd]             &  &   \\
             &  &                                                                  &  &                                                  &  &                                         &  &   \\
             &  & 0 \arrow[rr, "\text{snake}"] \arrow[dd]                          &  & {\tor_1^{A_1}(A'/p', F')} \arrow[dd]             &  & {\tor_1^{A_1}(A/p, F')} \arrow[dd]      &  &   \\
             &  &                                                                  &  &                                                  &  &                                         &  &   \\
0 \arrow[rr] &  & J \tensor_{A'} F' \arrow[rr, "\text{by commuting square}", hook] &  & p' \tensor_{A'} F' \arrow[rr] \arrow[dd]         &  & p \tensor_{A'} F' \arrow[rr] \arrow[dd] &  & 0 \\
             &  &                                                                  &  &                                                  &  &                                         &  &   \\
0 \arrow[rr] &  & J \tensor_{A'} F' \arrow[rr, "\text{by (2)}"', hook]             &  & A' \tensor_{A'} F' \arrow[rr] \arrow[dd]         &  & A \tensor_{A'} F' \arrow[rr] \arrow[dd] &  & 0 \\
             &  &                                                                  &  &                                                  &  &                                         &  &   \\
             &  & 0 \arrow[rr, "\text{snake}"]                                     &  & A'/p' \tensor_{A'} F' \arrow[dd] \arrow[rr, "="] &  & A/p \tensor_{A'} F' \arrow[dd]          &  &   \\
             &  &                                                                  &  &                                                  &  &                                         &  &   \\
             &  &                                                                  &  & 0                                                &  & 0                                       &  &  
\end{tikzcd}

Then by (1), we have $\tor_1^{A'}(A'/p', F') = \tor_1^{A'}(A/p, F') = 0$.

$\qed$

We will just need this for $A' = k[\eps]$ and $A=k$.

Proposition:
$T_z \hilb_{X/k} = \hom_{\OO_x}(I_z, \OO_z)$.

Proof:
Again we have $\T_z \hilb_{X/k} \subset \hilb_{X/k}(k[\eps])$, and is given by $\theset{Z' \subset X \cross_{\spec k} \spec k[\eps] \text{flat}/k[\eps] \suchthat Z' \cross_{\speck k[\eps]}\spec k = Z}$.

We have an exact diagram

\begin{tikzcd}
                    &  & 0 \arrow[r]  & I_{Z'} \arrow[r]           & {\OO_{X[\eps]}} \arrow[r]                               & \OO_{Z'} \arrow[r]           & 0  \\
0 \arrow[d]         &  &              & {} \arrow[d]               & {} \arrow[d]                                            & {} \arrow[d]                 &    \\
k \arrow[d]         &  & {} \arrow[r] & I_Z \arrow[r] \arrow[d]    & \OO_x \arrow[r] \arrow[d]                               & \OO_z \arrow[r] \arrow[d]    & {} \\
{k[\eps]} \arrow[d] &  & {} \arrow[r] & I_{Z'} \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & {\OO_{x[\eps]}} \arrow[r] \arrow[d]                     & \OO_{Z'} \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & {} \\
k \arrow[d]         &  & {} \arrow[r] & I_Z \arrow[r] \arrow[d]    & \OO_x \arrow[r] \arrow[d] \arrow[u, dotted, bend right] & \OO_Z \arrow[r] \arrow[d]    & {} \\
0                   &  &              & {}                         & {}                                                      & {}                           &   
\end{tikzcd}

Note the existence of a splitting above.

Given $\phi \in \hom_{\OO_x}(I_Z, \OO_Z)$.
We have 

\begin{align*}
I_{Z'} = \theset{f + \eps g \suchthat f\in I_Z,~ \phi(f) = g \mod I_Z,~ \phi(f) \in \OO_Z,~ g\mod I_Z \in \OO_x/I_Z = \OO_Z}
.\end{align*}

It's easy to see that $Z' \subset x'$, and

1. $Z'\cross k = Z$
2. It's flat over $k[\eps]$, looking at $0 \to k\tensor I_{Z'} \to I_{Z'}$.

For the converse, take $f\in I_Z$ and lift to $f' = f + \eps g \in I_{Z'}$, then $g\in \OO_x$ is well-defined wrt $I_Z$.
Then $g\in \hom_{\OO_x}(I_z, \OO_z)$.

The main point: these hom sets are extremely computable.

Example:
Let $Z$ be a twisted cubic in $\hilb_{\PP^3/k}^{3t+1}(k)$.

Observation:
$\hom_{\OO_x}(I_Z, \OO_Z) = \hom_{\OO_X}(I_Z/I_Z^2, \OO_Z) = \hom_{\OO_Z}(I_Z/I_Z^2, \OO_Z)$.
If $I_Z/I_Z^2$ is locally free, these are global sections of the dual, i.e. $H^0((I_Z/I_Z^2)\dual)$.

In this case, $Z\injects X$ is regularly embedded, and thus $(I_Z/I_Z^2)\dual$ should be regarded as the normal bundle.

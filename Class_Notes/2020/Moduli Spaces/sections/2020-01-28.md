Last time:
Twisted cubics, given by $\hilb_{\PP^3_k}^{3t+1}$.

We got lower (?) bounds on the dimension by constructing families, but want an exact dimension.

Key:
Let $Z\subset X$ be a closed $k\dash$dimensional subspace.

Proposition:
For $[z] \in \hilb_{X/k}^P(k)$, we have an identification of the Zariski tangent space $T_[z] \hilb_{X/k}^P = \hom_{\OO_x}(I_z, \OO_z)$.

Say $F: (\sch/K)\op \to \sets$ is a function and let $x\in F(k)$.
There is an inclusion $i: \spec k \injects \spec k[\eps]$.
Then there is an induced map $F(\spec k [\eps]) \mapsvia{i^*} F(\spec k)$ where $T_x F \definedas (i^*)\inv(x) \mapsto x$.
So if $F$ is represented by a scheme $H/k$, then $T_x h_J = T_x H = (\mfm_x / \mfm_x^2)\dual$ over $k$.

> Will need a criterion for flatness later, esp. for Artinian thickenings.

Lemma:
Assume $A'$ is a Noetherian ring and $0 \to J \to A' \to A \to 0$ with $J^2 = 0$.
Assume we have $X' / \spec A'$.

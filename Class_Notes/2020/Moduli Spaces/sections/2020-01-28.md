Last time:
Twisted cubics, given by $\hilb_{\PP^3_k}^{3t+1}$.

We got lower (?) bounds on the dimension by constructing families, but want an exact dimension.

Key:
Let $Z\subset X$ be a closed $k\dash$dimensional subspace.

Proposition:
For $[z] \in \hilb_{X/k}^P(k)$, we have an identification of the Zariski tangent space $T_[z] \hilb_{X/k}^P = \hom_{\OO_x}(I_z, \OO_z)$.

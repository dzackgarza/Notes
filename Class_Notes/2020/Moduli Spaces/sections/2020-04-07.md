(Missing first few minutes.)

Take $I_{q+1}$ to be the minimal $I$ such that $\mfm_q I_q \subset I \subset I_1$ and $\xi_q$ lifts to $S/I$.

Claim:
Such a minimal $I$ exists, i.e. if $I, I'$ satisfy the two conditions then $I \intersect I'$ does as well.
So $I, I'$ are determined by their images $v, v'$ in the vector space $I_q \tensor k$.
So enlarge either $v$ or $v'$ such that $v + v' = I_q \tensor k$ but $v \intersect v'$ is the same.
We can thus assume that $I + I' = I_q$, and so
\begin{align*}
S / I \intersect I' = S/I \cross_{S/I_q} S/I'
\end{align*}
which by H1 yields a map
\begin{align*}
F(S/I\intersect I') &\to F(S/I) \cross_{F(S/I_q)} F(S/I')
\end{align*}

So $I\intersect I'$ satisfies both conditions and thus a minimal $I_{q+1}$ exists.
Let $\xi_{q+1}$ be a lift of $\xi_q$ over $S/I_{q+1}$ (noting that there may be many lifts).

Define $R = \directlimit R_q$ and $\xi = \directlimit \xi_q$, the claim is that $(R, \xi)$ is miniversal.

We already have $h_R \mapsvia{\xi} F$ and thus $t_R \mapsvia{\cong}t_F$ is fulfilled.
We need to show formal smoothness, i.e. for $A' \to A$ a small thickening, suppose we have a lift

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
 & & h_R \ar[d, "\xi"] \\
h_a \ar[rru, "n"] \ar[rrr, bend left] \ar[r] & h_{A'} \ar[r] & F
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

If we have a $u'$ such that commutativity in square 1 holds (?) then we can form a lift $u'$ satisfying commutativity in both squares 1 and 2.

We can restrict sections to get a map $F(A') \to F(A)$ and using representability obtain $h_R(A') \to h_R(A)$.

(Missing first few minutes.)

Take $I_{q+1}$ to be the minimal $I$ such that $\mfm_q I_q \subset I \subset I_1$ and $\xi_q$ lifts to $S/I$.

Claim:
Such a minimal $I$ exists, i.e. if $I, I'$ satisfy the two conditions then $I \intersect I'$ does as well.
So $I, I'$ are determined by their images $v, v'$ in the vector space $I_q \tensor k$.
So enlarge either $v$ or $v'$ such that $v + v' = I_q \tensor k$ but $v \intersect v'$ is the same.
We can thus assume that $I + I' = I_q$, and so
\begin{align*}
S / I \intersect I' = S/I \cross_{S/I_q} S/I'
\end{align*}
which by H1 yields a map
\begin{align*}
F(S/I\intersect I') &\to F(S/I) \cross_{F(S/I_q)} F(S/I')
\end{align*}

So $I\intersect I'$ satisfies both conditions and thus a minimal $I_{q+1}$ exists.

(Missing first few minutes.)

Take $I_{q+1}$ to be the minimal $I$ such that $\mfm_q I_q \subset I \subset I_1$ and $\xi_q$ lifts to $S/I$.

Claim:
Such a minimal $I$ exists, i.e. if $I, I'$ satisfy the two conditions then $I \intersect I'$ does as well.
So $I, I'$ are determined by their images $v, v'$ in the vector space $I_q \tensor k$.
So enlarge either $v$ or $v'$ such that $v + v' = I_q \tensor k$ but $v \intersect v'$ is the same.
We can thus assume that $I + I' = I_q$, and so
\begin{align*}
S / I \intersect I' = S/I \cross_{S/I_q} S/I'
\end{align*}
which by H1 yields a map
\begin{align*}
F(S/I\intersect I') &\to F(S/I) \cross_{F(S/I_q)} F(S/I')
\end{align*}

So $I\intersect I'$ satisfies both conditions and thus a minimal $I_{q+1}$ exists.
Let $\xi_{q+1}$ be a lift of $\xi_q$ over $S/I_{q+1}$ (noting that there may be many lifts).

Define $R = \directlimit R_q$ and $\xi = \directlimit \xi_q$, the claim is that $(R, \xi)$ is miniversal.

We already have $h_R \mapsvia{\xi} F$ and thus $t_R \mapsvia{\cong}t_F$ is fulfilled.
We need to show formal smoothness, i.e. for $A' \to A$ a small thickening, suppose we have a lift

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
 & & h_R \ar[d, "\xi"] \\
h_a \ar[rru, "n"] \ar[rrr, bend left] \ar[r] & h_{A'} \ar[r] & F
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

If we have a $u'$ such that commutativity in square 1 holds (?) then we can form a lift $u'$ satisfying commutativity in both squares 1 and 2.

We can restrict sections to get a map $F(A') \to F(A)$ and using representability obtain $h_R(A') \to h_R(A)$.
Combining H1 and H2, we know $t_F$ acts transitively on fibers, yielding

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
t_R \selfmap \ar[d, "\cong"] & u'\in h_R(A') \ar[r] \ar[d] \ar[r] & u\in h_R(A) \ar[d]\\
t_F \selfmap & \eta' \in F(A') \ar[r] \ar[r] & \eta \in F(A) \\
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Then $u' \mapsto u$ is equivalent to (1), and $u' \mapsto \eta'$ is equivalent to (2).
Let $\eta_0$ be the image of $u'$ and define $\eta' = \eta_0 + \theta, \theta \in t_F$ then $u' = u' + \theta, \theta \in t_R$.
So we can modify the lift to make these agree.

Thus it suffices to show
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
A' \ar[r] & A & R_q \ar[l] \\
S \ar[u, "v"] \ar[r] & \ar[lu, dotted, "\exists_? u'"] \ar[u, "u"] \ar[ur] &
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

We get a diagram of the form
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
S \ar[d] \ar[r, "w"] & A' \cross_A R_1 \ar[r]\ar[d, "\pi_2, \text{small}"] & A' \ar[d, "\text{small}"]\\
R \ar[r] & R_q \ar[r] & A
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Some observations:

1. $S \to R_q$ is surjective.
2. $\im(w) \subset A' \cross_A R_1$ is a subring, so either
  a. $\im(w) \mapsvia{\cong} R_q$ if it doesn't meet the kernel, or
  b. $\im(w) = A' \cross_A R_q$

In case (a), this yields a section of the middle map and we'd get a map $R_q \to A'$ and thus the original map we were after $R \to A$.

So assume $w$ is surjective and consider
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \ar[r] & I \ar[r] & S \ar[r] & A' \cross_A R_q \ar[r]\ar[d, "\text{small}"] & 0  \\
 & & & R_q &
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

and we have $\mfm_S I_1 \subset I \subset I_q$ where the second containment is because $I$ a quotient of $R_q$ factors through $S/I$ and the first is because $S/I$ is a small thickening of $R_q$.

But $\xi_q$ lifts of $S/I$, and we have
\begin{align*}
\xi \in F(S/I) \surjects \xi = \xi' \cross \xi_q ?
.\end{align*}

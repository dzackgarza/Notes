Recall that we are looking at $X_0/k$, $F: \art/k \to \sets$ where $A$ is sent to $X/A$ flat with $i: X_0 \injects X$ where $i\tensor k$ is an isomorphism.
The second condition is equivalent to a cartesian diagram
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
X_0 \ar[r, hook]\ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
\spec k \ar[r, hook] & \spec A
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

We showed we always have H1 and H2, and H3 if $X_0/k$ is projective or $X_0$ is affine with isolated singularities.
In this situation we have a miniversal family.

This occurs iff for $A' \to A$ a small thickening and $(X_0 \injects X) \in F(A)$, we have a surjection
\begin{align*}
\Aut_{A'}(X_0 \injects X') \surjects \Aut_A(X_0 \injects X)
.\end{align*}

where the RHS are automorphisms of $X/A$, i.e. those which commute with the identity on $A$ and $X_0$.

We had a naive functor $F_n$ where we don't include the inclusion $X_0 \injects X$.
When $F$ has a hull then the naive functor has a versal family, since there is a forgetful map that is formally smooth.

If it's the case that for all $A' \to A$ small and $F_{\text{n}} \to F_n(A)$ we have $\Aut_{A'}(X') \surjects \Aut_A (X)$, then $F = F_n$ and both are pro-representable.
The forgetful map is smooth because given $X/A$ in $F_n(A)$, we have some inclusion $X_0 \injects X$, so one gives surjectivity.
Using the surjectivity on automorphisms, we get
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
X_0\ar[rd, hook] \ar[rr, hook] & & X\ar[ld, dotted] \\
& X & 
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Deformation theory is better at answering when the following diagrams exist:

i.e., the existence of an extension of $X$ to $A'$.
This is different than understanding diagrams of the following type

where we're considering isomorphism classes of the squares, and deformation theory helps understand the blue one.

Example:
Hypersurface singularities.

Take $S = k[x, y]$ and $B = S/(f)$, then deformations of $\spec B$ to ?

Given $k \to k[\eps] \to k$ we can tensor to obtain

We want to understand $F(k[\eps])$.
We know $f' = f + \eps g$ for some $g\in S$.
Some observations:

1. $g\in B$ and $f'' = f + \eps(g + cf)$ generates the same ideal.
2. We're free to reparameterize, i.e. $x \mapsto x + \eps a$ and $y \mapsto y + \eps b$ and thus $g \mapsto g + a f_x + b f_y$ (the partial derivatives).

Thus isomorphism classes of $B'$ in deformations $B' \to B$ only depend on the isomorphism classes $g\in B/(f_x, f_y) B$.
When the singularities are isolated, this quotient is finite-dimensional as a $k\dash$vector space.

> Example: $F(k[\eps]) = B/(f_x, f_y)B$.

Thus H3 holds and there is a miniversal family $h_R \to F$.
We can describe it explicitly: take $g_i \in S$, yielding a $k\dash$basis in $S/(f, f_x, f_y)$.
Then $V(f + \sum t_i g_i) \subset \spec k[[t_1, \cdots, t_n]][x, y]$.
Set $R = k[[t_1, \cdots, t_n]]$, then this lands in $\AA_R^2$.

Example:
The nodal curve $y^2 = x^3$, take $S/(y^2-x^3, 2y, -3x^2) = S/(y, x^2)$.
So take $g_1 = 1, g_2 = x$, then the miniversal family is $V(y^2 - x^3 + t + t_2 x) \subset \AA^2_{k[[t_1, t_2]]}$.
This gives all ways of smoothing the node.

Recall how we constructed the hilbert scheme of hypersurfaces
$$
\hilb_{\PP_k^n}^{P_{m, d}} = \PP H^0(\PP^n; \OO(d))\dual
$$
A section $\hilb_{\PP_k^n}^{P}(s)$ corresponds to $z\in \PP^n_s$.
We can look at the exact sequence

\begin{align*}
0 \to I_Z(m) \to \OO_{\PP_S^n} \mapsvia{\text{restrict}} \OO_z(m) \to 0
.\end{align*}

as $\PP_s^n \mapsvia{\pi_s} S$, so we can pushforward along $\pi$, which is left-exact, so

\begin{align*}
0 \to \pi_{s*} I_Z(m) \to \pi_{s*} \OO_{\PP_S^n}  = \OO_S \tensor H^0(\PP^n; \OO(m)) \to \OO_z(m) \to R^1 \pi_{s*} I_Z(m) \to \cdots
.\end{align*}

*Idea:*
$Z \subset \PP_k^n$ will be determined (in families!) by the space of degree $d$ polynomials vanishing on $Z$ (?), i.e. $H^0(\PP^n, I_z(m)) \subset H^0(\PP^n, \OO(m))$ for $m$ very large.
This would give a map of functors $\hilb_{\PP_k^n}^{P} \to \Gr(N, H^0(\PP^n, \OO(m) ))$.
If this is a closed subfunctor, a closed subfunctor of a representable functor is representable and we're done.

Some facts about the Hilbert polynomial:

1. For a subscheme $Z \subset $\PP_k^n$ with $\deg P_z = \dim Z = n$, then $p_z(t) = \deg z t^n/(n!) + O(t^{n-1})$.
2. We have $p_z(t) = \chi(\OO_z(t))$, consider the sequence $0 \to I_z(t) \to \OO_{\PP^n}^{(t)} \to \OO_z^{(t)} \to 0$, then $\chi(I_z(t)) = \dim H^0( \PP^n, J_z(t)  )$ for $t \gg 0$, and $p_z(0)$ is the Euler characteristic of $\OO_Z$.

Good example to keep in mind: the twisted cubic

Then $p_C(t) = (\deg C)t + \chi(\OO_{\PP^1}) = 3t + 1$.

Hypersurfaces:
Recall length 2 subschemes of $\PP^1$ are the same as specifying quadratics that cut them out, each such $Z \subset \PP^1$ satisfies $Z = V(f)$ where $\deg f = d$ and $f$ is homogeneous.
So we'll be looking at $\PP H^0(\PP^n_k, \OO(d))\dual$, and the guess would be that this is $\hilb_{\PP^n_k}$

Resolve the structure sheaf

\begin{align*}
0 \to \OO_{\PP^n}(-d) \to \OO_{\PP^n}(t) \to \OO_D(t) \to 0
.\end{align*}

so we can twist to obtain

\begin{align*}
0 \to \OO_{\PP^n}(t-d) \to \OO_{\PP^n}(t) \to \OO_D(t) \to 0
.\end{align*}

Then $\chi(\OO_D(t)) = \chi(\OO_{\PP^n}(t)) - \chi(\OO_{\PP^n}(t-d))$, which is ${n+t \choose n} - {n+t-d \choose n} = d t^{n-1}/(n-1)! + O(t^{n-2})$.

**Lemma:**
Anything with the Hilbert polynomial of a degree $d$ hypersurface is in fact a degree $d$ hypersurface.

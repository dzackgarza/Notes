See notes on Ben's website.
We'll review where we were.

## Deformation Theory

We want to represent certain moduli functors by schemes.
If we know a functor is representable, it's easier to understand the deformation theory of it and still retain a lot of geometric information.
The representability of deformation is much easier to show.


We're considering functors $F: \Art/k \to \Sets$.

Example
:   The Hilbert functor
    \begin{align*}
    \hilb_{X/k} (\Sch/k)\op \to \sets \\
    S \mapsto \theset{ Z  \subset  X \cross S \text{ flat over } S}
    .\end{align*}

    This yields to
    \begin{align*}
    F: \art/K \to \sets \\
    ???
    .\end{align*}

Recall that we're interested in pro-representability, where $\hat F(R) = \liminverse F(R\mu_R^n)$ is given by a lift of the form
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\Art/k \ar[r, "F"] & \sets \\
\hat{\Art/k}\ar[u, hook] \ar[ur, "\hat F"]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Question:
Is $\hat F$ representable, i.e. is $F$ pro-representable?

Example
:   The $F$ in the previous example is pro-representable by $\hat F = \hom(\OO_{\hilb, z_0}, \wait)$.

Definition (Pro-representable Hull)
: $F$ has a *pro-representable hull* iff there is a formally smooth map $h_R \to F$.

Question: does $F$ have a pro-representable hull?

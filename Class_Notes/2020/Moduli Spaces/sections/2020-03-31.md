See notes on Ben's website.
We'll review where we were.

## Deformation Theory

We want to represent certain moduli functors by schemes.
If we know a functor is representable, it's easier to understand the deformation theory of it and still retain a lot of geometric information.
The representability of deformation is much easier to show.

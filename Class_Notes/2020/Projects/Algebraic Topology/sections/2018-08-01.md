Today: a review of singular homology, Mayer-Vietoris.

First we'll review reduced homology: if we have a chain complex $C_*X$, we can associate a *reduced chain complex* given by
\begin{align*}
\tilde C_*X \definedas \cdots \to C_1 X \to C_0 X \to C_{-1}X\definedas \ZZ \to 0
.\end{align*}

Why do this? 
It yields $\tilde H_*(\pt) = 0$, where we recall that the usual homology is given by
\begin{align*}
H_n(\pt) = 
\begin{dcases}
\ZZ, & n=1 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{dcases}
.\end{align*}

## Relative Homology

For $A\subset X$, there is an exact sequence
\begin{align*}
0 \to C_* A \to C_* X \to C_*(X, A) \definedas C_*X / C_* A,
,\end{align*}

and we define $C_*(X, A)$ to be the *relative chain complex*.
For $[x]\in C_n(X, A)$, we obtain a coset $[x] = x + C_n A$ where $x\in C_n(X)$.

Elements of $H_n(X, A)$ are therefore $n\dash$cycles $x\in C_{n}X$ such that $\bd x\in C_{n-1}A$.
This immediately yields a LES
\begin{align*}
H_nX \to H_n(X, A) \mapsvia{\delta} H_{n-1}A \mapsvia{\iota_*} H_{n-1}X \to \cdots
\end{align*}
where $A \mapsvia{\iota} X$.

Warning
:   $\iota$ injective does *not* imply $\iota^*$ is injective!
:   A counterexample is $S^{n-1} \injects D^n$, where the former has nontrivial homology but the latter is contractible.

# Prelim Level

## Linear Algebra
Vector spaces, subspaces, basis and dimension, linear transformations and matrices, rank and nullity, change of basis and similarity of matrices, inner product spaces, orthogonality and, orthonormality, Gram-Schmidt process, adjoints of linear transformations and dual spaces, quadratic forms and symmetric matrices, orthogonal and unitary matrices, diagonalization of hermitian and symmetric matrices, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and their computation, exponentiation of matrices and application to differential equations, least squares problems, trace, determinant, canonical forms. Systems of linear equations: solvability criteria, Gaussian elimination, row-reduced form, LU decomposition.

## Analysis
One-variable calculus foundations: completeness of the real numbers, sequences, series, limits, continuity, including epsilon-delta arguments, maxima and minima, uniform continuity, definition of the derivative, the mean value theorem, Taylor expansion with remainder, Riemann integral, mean value theorem for integrals, fundamental theorem of calculus, sequences and series of functions, uniform convergence and integration, differentiation under the integral sign, contraction maps, fixed point theory, with applications to Newton's method and solutions of non-linear equations, numerical integration with error estimation.
Metric space topology and analysis, primarily in R^n: open and closed sets, completeness, convergence of sequences of numbers and functions, closure, compactness, connectedness, uniform continuity, equicontinuity, countability and uncountability (e.g. of the reals), spaces of functions. Basic arguments and theorems of undergraduate analysis using these concepts, including the Bolzano-Weierstrass, the Stone-Weierstrass, and the Arzela-Ascoli theorems.
Multivariable calculus: definition of differentiability in several variables (approximating linear transformation), partial derivatives, chain rule, Taylor expansion in several variables, inverse and implicit function theorems, equality of mixed partials, multivariable integration, change of variables formula.

Let $(X, \omega)$ be a symplectic manifold acted on by a lie group $G$. There is a moment map $\mu: X \to \mathcal{Of}^*$ (?), and we can consider a quotient space $X//G = \mu^{-1}(0) / G$ where we look at where the moment map vanishes and quotient out by a group action. This is an orbifold, and in fact a manifold and symplectic.

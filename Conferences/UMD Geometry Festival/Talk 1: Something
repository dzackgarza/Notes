Outline: 

- Geometric interpretation of Euler equations for incompressible fluids (Arnold 1966)
- Discrete fluids, combinatorial optimization, generalized incompressible flows
- Generalized minimizing geodesics with probability and convexity tools (1989-2012)
- The initial value problem, relates to the completeness of certain manifolds (2018)

First PDEs written in modern style: Euler, 1757

The Euler flow is an incompressible fluid confined to a compact Riemannian manifolds, evolving according to the Euler equations. (It wasn't clear how to extend defn of Riemannian manifolds to infinite dimensions.) Evolve along geodesics, need to be volume-preserving. Look at action on gridded-up version of torus $T^2$.

Discrete version of incompressible motion - acts by permutation, i.e. a finite series of permutations on gridded cells. Compute "cost" of flow by adding squares of displacements, which increases if any step moves any given grid by a large amount.

There is some solution that gives the final permutation at the lowest cost -- the possibilities are finite, but large. This will be our "geodesic", i.e. optimal transport.

Example: find the minimal flow between $[1,2,\cdots n]$ and $[n, n-1, \cdots, 2, 1]$. Transpositions get it done in 12 steps. This is nice because it passes to the limit nicely, which ends up looking like a solution to Euler's equation. Observe pattern of each number "bouncing" off wall, while its neighboring number does so in a symmetric fashion the yields a rectangle.

Well-known: in 1D, there is no non-trivial solution.

In passing to the continuous limit, this solution can be improved by a factor of $\frac \pi {12}$. Actual solution in continuous case is known; all trigonometric functions. This shape is reflected in the finite

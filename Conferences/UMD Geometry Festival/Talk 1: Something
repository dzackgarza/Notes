Outline: 

- Geometric interpretation of Euler equations for incompressible fluids (Arnold 1966)
- Discrete fluids, combinatorial optimization, generalized incompressible flows
- Generalized minimizing geodesics with probability and convexity tools (1989-2012)
- The initial value problem, relates to the completeness of certain manifolds (2018)





First PDEs written in modern style: Euler, 1757

The Euler flow is an incompressible fluid confined to a compact Riemannian manifolds, evolving according to the Euler equations. (It wasn't clear how to extend defn of Riemannian manifolds to infinite dimensions.) Evolve along geodesics, need to be volume-preserving. Look at action on gridded-up version of torus $T^2$.

Discrete version of incompressible motion - acts by permutation.

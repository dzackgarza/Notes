## Euler Equations

First PDEs written in modern style: Euler, 1757

The Euler flow is an incompressible fluid confined to a compact Riemannian manifolds, evolving according to the Euler equations. (It wasn't clear how to extend defn of Riemannian manifolds to infinite dimensions.) Evolve along geodesics, need to be volume-preserving. Look at action on gridded-up version of torus $T^2$.

Discrete version of incompressible motion - acts by permutation, i.e. a finite series of permutations on gridded cells. Compute "cost" of flow by adding squares of displacements, which increases if any step moves any given grid by a large amount.

There is some solution that gives the final permutation at the lowest cost -- the possibilities are finite, but large. This will be our "geodesic", i.e. optimal transport.

Example: find the minimal flow between $[1,2,\cdots n]$ and $[n, n-1, \cdots, 2, 1]$. Transpositions get it done in 12 steps. This is nice because it passes to the limit nicely, which ends up looking like a solution to Euler's equation. Observe pattern of each number "bouncing" off wall, while its neighboring number does so in a symmetric fashion the yields a rectangle.

Well-known: in 1D, there is no non-trivial solution.

In passing to the continuous limit, this solution can be improved by a factor of $\frac \pi {12}$. Actual solution in continuous case is known; all trigonometric functions. This shape is reflected in the finite numeric simulations.

This generalized solution has been discovered in an entirely different framework involving random walks on the symmetric group (Virag et al). The least action principle ruling the original problem is the limit of a large deviation principle ruling the random exchange of adjacent cells in the discrete model. This principle says that looking at Brownian motion to a point, conditioned on the motion being in a neighborhood of that point, converges to a geodesic in the limit as the noise goes to zero.



## Generalized Flows

A generalized incompressible flow on a compact Riemannian manifold $D$ is a probability measure $\mu$ on paths $\xi_t$ such that $\mu$ has finite energy $E_\mu \int_0^T \frac 1 2 \abs{\frac{d\xi}{dt}}^2 dt$ (where we take the expectation of this integral).

Main results on minimizing geodesic (since 1992): let $\mu_{0, T}$ be a probability measure on $D\times D$ such that the projections $\mu_0=\mu_t = \mathcal L_D$, the Lebesgue measure.

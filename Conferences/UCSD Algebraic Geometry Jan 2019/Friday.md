Keywords:
- Modular variety
- Calabi-Yau model
- Modular forms
- Hodge numbers
- Picard group

Definition: A Calabi-Yau manifold is a complex project manifold $X$ with a trivial canonical class, where $H^k(X, \mathcal{O}_X) = 0$ for $k=0,n$

$\dim X = 1:$ Elliptic curves, all topologically $T^2$
$\dim X = 2: K_3$ surface, only one topological type (all diffeomorphic)
$\dim X = 3$: Many, suspected to be finite (around 500 million possibly!), unknown if infinite.

Hodge numbers
- $H^{?,?}$: Number of deformations
- $H^{1,1}(X)$: Number of independent curve classes

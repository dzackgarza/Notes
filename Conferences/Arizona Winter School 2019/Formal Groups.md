A *formal group law* is an intermediate notion between a Lie group and a Lie algebra, being slightly more general than a Lie algebra, which has a product operation that can be represented entirely in terms of formal power series.

Given a lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ over a field $k$, a *deformation* of $\mathfrak g$ is another lie algebra $\mathfrak a$ over a $k\dash$algebra $A$, along with an isomorphism
$$
\phi: \mathfrak g \to \mathfrak a \tensor_A k

A *formal group law* is an intermediate notion between a Lie group and a Lie algebra, being slightly more general than a Lie algebra, which has a product operation that can be represented entirely in terms of formal power series.

These appear in Topology when considering "complex oriented cohomology theories" evaluated on $\CP^\infty$, and in particular in complex cobordism cohomology. They are also useful in class field theory to

Given a lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ over a field $k$, a *deformation* of $\mathfrak g$ is another lie algebra $\mathfrak a$ over a $k\dash$algebra $A$, along with an isomorphism

A *formal group law* is an intermediate notion between a Lie group and a Lie algebra, being slightly more general than a Lie algebra, which has a product operation that can be represented entirely in terms of formal power series.

These appear in Topology when considering "complex oriented cohomology theories" evaluated on $\CP^\infty$, and in particular in complex cobordism cohomology. They are also useful in class field theory to construct something called the "local Artin map". In characteristic zero, every formal group is completely determined by a corresponding Lie algebra. Moreover, a formal group is a group object in the category of formal schemes.

Given a lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ over a field $k$, a *deformation* of $\mathfrak g$ is another lie algebra $\mathfrak a$ over a $k\dash$algebra $A$, along with an isomorphism
$$
\phi: \mathfrak g \to \mathfrak a \tensor_A k

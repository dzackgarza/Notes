A *formal group law* is an intermediate notion between a Lie group and a Lie algebra, which is defined by a power series that essentially resembles.

A related notion is that of a deformation of a lie algebra. Given a lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ over a field $k$, a *deformation* of $\mathfrak g$ is another lie algebra $\mathfrak a$ over a $k\dash$algebra $A$, along with an isomorphism
$$
\phi: \mathfrak g \to \mathfrak a \tensor_A k

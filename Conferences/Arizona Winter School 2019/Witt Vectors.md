# Witt Vectors

General idea: given a commutative ring $R$, a Witt vector $w$ will be an infinite sequence of elements of $R$. Taking $W(R)$ to be a collection of such $w$, we will equip $W(R)$ with its own ring structure.

One useful fact will be that $W(\FF_p) = \ZZ_p$, the ring of $p\dash$adic integers.

> Quick review: the $p\dash$adic integers are completions of $\ZZ$ that are not equal just $\QQ$, where "complete" is meant

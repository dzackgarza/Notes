# Preface

These are notes taken from the [2019 Arizona Winter School](http://swc.math.arizona.edu/aws/2019/index.html), which are perhaps closer to transcriptions, as I've referred back to the videos to include as much detail as possible.
As such, I make no claims of originality, I've merely compiled everything into one place in written form for my own purposes, and share it in the hopes that it may be useful to others as well.

## Group Theory

Sylow Theorems: Write $\abs{G} = p^n m$ where $m {\notdivides} p$, $S_p$ a sylow$\dash p$ subgroup, and $n_p$ the number of sylow$\dash p$ subgroups.

- $\forall p^n \divides \abs{G}$, there exists a subgroup of size $p^n$.
  - Corollary: $\forall p \divides \abs{G}$, there exists an element of order $p$.
- All sylow$\dash p$ subgroups are conjugate for a given $p$.
  - Corollary: $n_p = 1 \implies S_p \normal G$
- $n_p \divides m$
- $n_p \equiv 1 \mod p$
- $n_p = [F : N(S_p)]$ where $N$ is the normalizer.

Useful facts: 

  - $\ZZ_p, \ZZ_q \subset G \implies \ZZ_p \intersect \ZZ_q = \ZZ_{(p,q)}$, so coprime order subgroups are disjoint.
  - $(p, q) = 1 \implies \ZZ_p \times \ZZ_q \cong \ZZ_{pq}$
  - Characterizing direct products: $G \cong H \times K$ when
    - $G = HK = \theset{hk \suchthat h\in H, k\in K}$
    - $H\intersect K = \theset{e} \subset G$
    - $H, K \normal G$
      - Can relax to only $H\normal G$ to get a semidirect product instead
  
**Semidirect Products**:

$G = N \semidirect_\phi H$ where 
$$
\phi: H \to \Aut(N) \\
h \mapsto h(\wait)h^{-1}
$$

Note $\Aut(\ZZ_n) \cong (\ZZ^n)\units \cong \ZZ^{\varphi(n)}$ where $\varphi$ is the totient function.

**Class Equation**:
$$
\abs{G} = \abs{Z(G)} + \sum_{\substack{\text{One $x_i$ from} \\ \text{each conjugacy class}}} [G: C_G(x_i)]
$$
where $C_G(x)$ is the centralizer of $x$, given by $C_G(x) = \theset{g \suchthat [g, x] = e}$.

**Fields:**
$GF(p^n)$ is obtained as $\frac{\FF_p}{\generators{f}}$ where $f$ is irreducible of degree $n$ .

## Linear Algebra

Finding the minimal polynomial $m(x)$ of $A$:

1. Find the characteristic polynomai $\chi(x)$; this annihilates $A$ by Cayley-Hamilton. Then $m(x) \mid \chi(x)$, so just test the finitely many products of irreducible factors.

2. Pick any $\vector v$ and compute $T\vector v, T^2\vector v, \cdots T^k\vector v$ until a linear dependence is introduced. Write this as $p(T) = 0$; then $\chi(x) \ p(x)$. 

Proof that when $A_i$ are diagonalizable, $\theset{A_i}$ commutes $\iff A,B$ are simultaneously diagonalizable: induction on number of operators

  - $A_n$ is diagonalizable, so $V = \bigoplus E_i$ a sum of eigenspaces
  - Restrict all $n-1$ operators $A$ to $E_n$. 
    - The commuted in $V$ so they commute here too
    - (Lemma) They were diagonalizable in $V$, so they're diagonalizable here too
    - $\implies$ they're simultaneously diagonalizable by I.H.
  - But these eigenvectors for the $A_i$ are all in $E_n$, so they're eigenvectors for $A_n$ too.
  - Can do this for each eigenspace. $\qed$

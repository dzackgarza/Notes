1. We prove the stronger statement that if $A$ is invertible and $A^n$ is diagonalizable, then $A$ is diagonalizable.

  With no assumptions, we know that $A$ has a minimal polynomial $\mu(x)$ satisfying $\mu(A) = 0$. It also divides the characteristic polynomial $p(x)$, and so $p(A) = 0$ as well. But we know $p(x) =

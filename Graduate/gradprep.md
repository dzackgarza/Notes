## Linear Algebra

Finite dimensional vector spaces (over R) and linear maps between them – subspaces, quotient spaces, dimension, bases, matrix representations. Positive definite inner products, orthonormal bases, extensions of orthonormal subsets. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors for automorphisms. Characteristic polynomial.

## Abstract Algebra

Definitions of groups, rings, fields, and modules over a ring. Homomorphisms of these objects. Subgroups, normal subgroups, quotient groups. Cyclic groups, finite abelian groups (structure theorem). Ideals, prime and maximal and their quotients — basic examples Z, k[X], rings of algebraic integers. Field extensions, splitting fields of polynomials, normal extensions.

## Complex Analysis: 

Definition of holomorphic functions, Cauchy integral formula, power series representations of holomorphic functions, radius of convergence, meromorphic functions, residues.

**Reference**: L. Ahlfors, ‘Complex Analysis‘, (McGraw-Hill, 1973), Chapters 1- 5.

## Real Analysis: 

A thorough working knowledge of advanced calculus, at the level of the books of W. Rudin or A. Browder as listed under Calculus. Additional topics: Pointwise uniform convergence of functions, equi-continuity, l2, L2(S1), Hilbert spaces, orthonormal bases.

## Other Introductory Material
For those entering students whose backgrounds are strong and who wish to do reading before entering graduate school to enrich their knowledge of mathematics the Department suggests the following books. The Department considers each of these to be a well-written introduction which conveys the flavor of the subject. Looking at these books may help give a feeling for various subspecialities within mathematics.

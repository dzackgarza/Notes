Other Introductory Material
For those entering students whose backgrounds are strong and who wish to do reading before entering graduate school to enrich their knowledge of mathematics the Department suggests the following books. The Department considers each of these to be a well-written introduction which conveys the flavor of the subject. Looking at these books may help give a feeling for various subspecialities within mathematics.

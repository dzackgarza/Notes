[Part 2: Surface bundles, mapping class groups, moduli spaces, and cohomology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Ly2NWX1g8)

29th Workshop in Geometric Topology, Oregon State University, June 29, 2012

- Talk about the theory surface bundles.
  - This talk: not so much related to his personal work!

[Part 3: Reconstruction problems in geometry and topology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0XBnKBKSDI)

- Work-in-progress!

Geometric motivation: a map $\phi \RR^n \to \RR^n$ if there is a matrix $A \in \GL(n, \RR)$ such that $\exists \vector{w} \in \RR^n :\forall \vector{v} \in \RR^n, \phi(\vector{v}) = A \vector{v} + \vector{w} $

29th Workshop in Geometric Topology, Oregon State University, June 29, 2012

- Talk about the theory surface bundles.
  - This talk: not so much related to his personal work!

Geometric motivation: a map $\phi \RR^n \to \RR^n$ if there is a matrix $A \in \GL(n, \RR)$ such that $\exists \vector{w} \in \RR^n :\forall \vector{v} \in \RR^n, \phi(\vector{v}) = A \vector{v} + \vector{w}.$

In other words, a composition of a linear map and a translation. Takes lines to lines, planes to planes.

Fundamental Theorem of Affine Geometry:
Suppose you have a set map that is a bijection $\Phi: \theset{\text{affine subspaces of } \RR^n} \selfmap$ which satisfies
$$
P_1 \subseteq P_2 \implies \Phi(P_1) \subseteq \Phi(P_2),
$$

then $\Phi$ is induced by a unique affine map $\phi$.

# Classifying Space

Usually look at this in the context of a topological group $G$, and denote $BG$ the classifying space of $G$. It is the quotient of some contractible space $EG$ by a free action of $G$, so we have something that looks like $G \to EG \to BG$ and $BG = EG/G$.

For a discrete group $G$, we have $BG = K(G,1)$, so that $\pi_1(BG) = G$ and $\pi_k(BG) = 0$ for $k \neq 1$.

*Question: what is a principal bundle? According to wikipedia, any G-principal bundle is a pullback of $EG \to BG$.*

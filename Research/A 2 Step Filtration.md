# A 2 Step Filtration



Let $X$ be a space and let $A\subset X$ be a subspace, so we have the following inclusions of spaces:

$$0 \injects A \injects B$$

Then consider applying the "chain functor" $C_*(\cdot): \textbf{Top} \into \textbf{Ab}$ that sends a space $X$ to a singular chain complex 


Applying this to the above inclusion

# Research Meeting Notes, January 17



We began this session with me going over a bit of what I'd read the past week (mostly Postnikov tower and rational homotopy), and started with a question about some of the most trivial examples of spectral sequences. The reply was that the long exact sequence is probably the best example, but I still need to do a bit of work to see how the LES sits inside a SS (and also how Mayer Vietoris does).

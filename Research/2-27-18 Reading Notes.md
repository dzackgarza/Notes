Stacks and orbifolds are concepts fromalgebraic geometry respectively geometric topology that allow us to talk about objects thatlocally look like the quotient of a smooth object by a group action, in a way that remembersinformation about the isotropy groups of the action.  Such 'stacky' objects can behave likesmooth  objects  even  if  the  underlying  spaces  have  singularities.   As  for  spaces,  manifolds,and schemes, cohomology theories are important invariants also for stacks and orbifolds, andexamples such as ordinary cohomology orK-theory lend themselves to generalization.  Spe-cial cases of orbifolds are `global quotients', often denoted M/G, for example for a smoothaction of a compact Lie groupGon a smooth manifold M.  In such examples, the orbifoldcohomology of M/G is supposed to be theG-equivariant cohomology ofM.  This suggests away todeneorbifold cohomology theories by means of equivariant stable homotopy theory,via suitableG-spectra.  However, since the groupGis not intrinsic and can vary, one needsequivariant cohomology theories for all groupsG, with some compatibility.  Global homotopytheory makes this idea precise.

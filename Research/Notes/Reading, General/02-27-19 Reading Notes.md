> The Hochschild homology of an R−R-bimodule reflects some ring-theoretic stuff. For instance, H1(R,R) of a k-algebra R is the module of differentials ΩR/k. If Q⊆R then there is an algebraic decomposition of this homology that is analogous to the Hodge decomposition in complex manifold theory.

> Taking the above example further if k is a ring and X a simplicial set, the cyclic homology (Hochschild homology taking into account a cyclic action on the corresponding simplicial set) of the simplicial module k[X] is the same as the S1-equivariant homology of the geometric realisation of X with coefficients in k.

> K-theory is like homology on rings. Moreover, algebraic topology is clearly interested in vector bundles; on a nice space X the category of rank n real vector bundles on X is equivalent to the category of rank n finitely generated projective modules over the continuous functions C(X,R). The group K0(C(X)) is the Grothendieck group of the isomorphism classes of fg projectives.

> We look first at vector bundles over a space X. A vector bundle assigns a vector
space to every point of X. This is done in a continuous fashion. The k-dimensional
vector bundles over X are equivalent to the homotopy classes of maps from X to
a fixed space BOk: [X, BOk], [Ste51]. So, as is the case with many geometric
problems, the classification of isomorphism classes of k-dimensional vector bundles
is reduced to the computation of homotopy classes of maps. Furthermore, it is clear
that studying BOk is very useful for this problem. It comes about by a standard
construction which builds a classifying space, BG, for any group G

Amazing result: all n-dim manifolds, M n , immerse in R2n−α(n) where α(n) is the number of ones in the binary expansion of n. (Wow!)

Reading: [Mark Hovey's List of Open Problems in Algebraic Topology](http://mhovey.web.wesleyan.edu/problems/big.html)

To look up and learn more about:

- The Weil Conjectures
  - What are the actual statements? What is their importance within AG?
  - What were Deligne's contributions?
- The Ravenel conjectures
  - Particularly Mike Hopkins' contributions
- The generating hypothesis in stable homotopy theory
- Elliptic cohomology
  - Hopkins' viewpoint on elliptic spectra
- The etale fundamental group
- Topological modular forms
- Index theory
- The chromatic splitting conjecture
  - Is this similar to fracture theorems in stable homotopy..?
- Bousfield localization
- The telescope conjecture
- Loop spaces
- Weyl groups
- The Kervaire invariant 1 problem
- The Adams Spectral Sequence
- Morava $K$ and $E$ theory

> Note: a vector bundle is a locally free sheaf.
> A scheme is a generalization of a ring, in the same way that a manifold is a generalization of R^n

To look up and learn more about:

- The Weil Conjectures
  - What are the actual statements? What is their importance within AG?
  - What were Deligne's contributions?
- The Ravenel conjectures
  - Particularly Mike Hopkins' contributions
- The generating hypothesis in stable homotopy theory
- Elliptic cohomology
  - Hopkins' viewpoint on elliptic spectra
- The etale fundamental group
- Topological modular forms
- Index theory
- The chromatic splitting conjecture
  - Is this similar to fracture theorems in stable homotopy..?
- Bousfield localization
- The telescope conjecture
- Loop spaces
- Weyl groups
- The Kervaire invariant 1 problem
- The Adams Spectral Sequence
- **Morava $K$ and $E$ theory**
- The Morava stabilizer groups
- Lubin-Tate spaces
- **Spectra**
  - Really spell out the details of how they're constructed (find/pick one of the nicer definitions) and their duality with homology theories
  - Extract some of the motivating examples of computations with spectra from my textbook annotations
  - Especially try to understand the bordism spectrum, $MO$?
- Hopf Algebras
  - Same story, extract and understand the motivating examples
  - Also piece together theory of e.g. comodules over them
  - Also Hopf Algebroids
- Localization
  - See some actual computations of computing "at a prime" or "away from a prime" 
- Gerbes
- Simplicial sets
  - Find some results that actually work/compute with these
- **$K\dash$theory**
- The Novikov conjecture
- Metrics and curvature on manifolds
- Understand the $H$ notation, i.e. $H\ZZ$
- $A_\infty$
- $H\dash$spaces
- Motivate and understand phantom maps
- Nilpotence
- Profinite groups
- Quasi-coherent sheaves over a scheme
- Moduli stacks
- Formal group laws
- Symmetric monoidal categories
- Quillen equivalence
- Model categories 
  - And cofibrant generation

There seems to be some interest from topologists and geometers around the **Novikov conjecture**. On the analytic side, **Sarnak's conjecture** seems to have some buzz as well.

Surface bundles and monodromy representations sound interesting.

I should really get a better grip on etale cohomology and the etale fundamental group.

Defining THH:
- Take $A \in \mathcal C$, a "nice" monoidal category, we'll call the monoidal operation $\tensor$.
- We'll make a simplicial object $THH_\wait(A)$

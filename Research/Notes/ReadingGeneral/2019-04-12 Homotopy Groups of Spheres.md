A homotopy n-sphere is a smooth n-manifold which is homotopy equivalent to
$S^n$. Kervaire and Milnor defined Θn to be the group of homotopy spheres up
to h-cobordism (where the group operation is given by connect sum). By the
h-cobordism theorem [Sma62] (n > 4) and Perelman’s proof of the Poincare conjecture [Per02], [Per03a], [Per03b] (n = 3), for n 6= 4, Θn = 0 if and only if $S^n$ has
a unique differentiable structure (i.e. there are no exotic spheres of dimension n).

We wish to consider the following question: For which n is Θn = 0?

The general belief is that there should be finitely many such n, and these n should
be concentrated in relatively low dimensions.

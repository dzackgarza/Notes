# Recent Developments in Algebraic Topology

Big Theorems:
- Brouwer Fixed Point
- Division Algebras over $\RR$
- Borsuk-Ulam
- Invariance of domain
- Aatiyah-Singer Index Theorem
  - $K\dash$theory and bordism
- Brown Representability Spectrum

Opinion from MO: modern Topology starts with spectra.

Stuff to Review:
- Stiefel-Whitney class
- Mapping cylinder/cone
- Chern class
- Euler class (or Euler bundle..?)

Stuff to Look Into
- Kervaire Invariant 1 Problem
  - Equivariant topology
  - Chromatic homotopy theory
  - Orthogonal spectra
- Model categories
- The cobordism hypothesis
- Milnor's conjecture
- Vandiver's conjecture
- $\infty\dash$categories
- Classifying orbifolds
- $K\dash$theory
- Deformation theory
- Topological modular forms
- Riemann-Roch
- Localizations
- Completions
- Steenrod Algebra
- Tate Twist

# Recent Developments in Algebraic Topology

Big Theorems:
- Brouwer Fixed Point
- Division Algebras over $\RR$
- Aatiyah-Singer Index Theorem
  - $K\dash$theory and bordism
- Brown Representability Spectrum

Opinion from MO: modern Topology starts with spectra.

Stuff to Look Into
- Kervaire Invariant 1 Problem
  - Equivariant topology
  - Chromatic homotopy theory
  - Orthogonal spectra
- Model categories
- The cobordism hypothesis
- Milnor's conjecture
- Vandiver's conjecture
- $\infty\dash$categories
- Classifying orbifolds
- $K\dash$theory

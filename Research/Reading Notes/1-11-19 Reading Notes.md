# Recent Developments in Algebraic Topology

Big Theorems:
- Brouwer Fixed Point
- Division Algebras over $\RR$
- Borsuk-Ulam
- Invariance of domain
- Aatiyah-Singer Index Theorem
  - $K\dash$theory and bordism
- Brown Representability Spectrum

Opinion from MO: modern Topology starts with spectra.

Stuff to Review:
- Stiefel-Whitney class
- Mapping cylinder/cone
- Chern class
- Euler class (or Euler bundle..? Find in old email)
- Homotopy limit/colimit
- The $J$-homomorphism
  - [See beginning of Hopkins talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix4pg87LKVk)
- $p\dash$adic stuff
- Linearly independent sections
- Normal bundle
- Tubular neighborhoods
- Resolutions
- Suspension

- $K\dash$theory
- Deformation theory
- Topological modular forms
- Riemann-Roch
- Localizations

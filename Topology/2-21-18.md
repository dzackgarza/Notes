# Bar Resolutions
Let $A$ be an associative, unital, generally not commutative algebra over a field $k$ (or just a ring over $\ZZ$). Consider the category of $A\dash A\dash$ bimodules, which has the fundamental structure of two multiplication maps of the form
$$
A\tensor M \tensor A \to M\\
a_1\tensor m \tensor a_2 \mapsto a_1 m a_2
$$

There is a particularly interesting module ${}_A A_A$, the "diagonal" or "trivial" module. Trivial because $(\wait)\tensor_A {}_A A_A = \id$ as a functor.

Note that this module is not free! However, compare this to ${}_A(A\tensor_k A)_A$ is a free module -- it is a vector space over $k$ -- of rank 1, with generator $1\tensor 1$. So we can write a free resolution of ${}_A A_A$ as a bimodule:

$$
(A^{\tensor 4}) \mapsvia{a\tensor b\tensor c \tensor d \mapsto ab\tensor c\tensor d - a\tensor bc \tensor d + a\tensor b \tensor cd} \\
{}_A(A^{\tensor 3})_A \mapsvia{f_1:~a\tensor b \tensor c ~\mapsto~ ab\tensor c - a\tensor bc} {}_A(A\tensor_k A)_A \mapsvia{f_0: ~a\tensor b~ \mapsto~ a1b} {}_A A_A \to 0
$$

Then $f_1$ surjects onto $\ker f_0$, yielding the second term.

Continue to yield $B^{-n}(A) = {}_A A\tensor_k A^{\tensor_k^{n}}\tensor_k A_A$, which is free as an $A\dash A\dash$ bimodule (it decomposes as a direct sum indexed by the middle term).

Let $A$ be an algebra over a field $k$ (or just a ring over $\ZZ$). Consider the category of $A\dash A\dash$ bimodules, which has the fundamental structure of two multiplication maps of the form
$$
A\tensor M \tensor A \to M\\
a_1\tensor m \tensor a_2 \mapsto a_1 m a_2
$$

There is a particularly interesting module ${}_A A_A$, the "diagonal" or "trivial" module.

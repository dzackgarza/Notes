# Homology

What is homology? Seems to be ubiquitous in mathematics, pops up in number theory, algebraic geometry, topology (obviously), ...?

Many routes to motivate it, we'll take the topological tact. Coming up:

1. Simplicial Homology
   Of simplicial complexes, a la Poincare ~1900
   Easier to compute
2. Singular Homology
   Easier to define, more general
   Harder to compute, need theorems



Definition: An *n-simplex* $\sigma = (a_0, \cdots a_n) \subseteq \RR^n$ is a *convex hull* of $n+1$ points when the points are *affinely independent*.

The convex hull is $\theset{\sum \lambda_i a_iL \mid 0 \leq \lambda_i \leq 1, \sum \lambda_i = 1}$.

They are affinely independent if there is a unique decomposition of every point into a sum of the above form (barycentric coordinates). $\sum v_i a_i = 0 \and \sum v_i = 0 \implies v_i = 0 ~\forall i$. It follows that if $\sum \lambda_i a_i = \sum \mu_i a_i$ then $\lambda_i = \mu_i ~\forall i$.

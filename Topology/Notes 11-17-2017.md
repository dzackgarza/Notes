# Homology

What is homology? Seems to be ubiquitous in mathematics, pops up in number theory, algebraic geometry, topology (obviously), ...?

Many routes to motivate it, we'll take the topological tact. Coming up:

1. Simplicial Homology
   Of simplicial complexes, a la Poincare ~1900
   Easier to compute
2. Singular Homology
   Easier to define, more general
   Harder to compute, need theorems



Definition: An *n-simplex* $\sigma = (a_0, \cdots a_n) \subseteq \RR^n$ is a *convex hull* of $n+1$ points when the points are *affinely independent*.

The convex hull is $\theset{\sum \lambda_i a_iL \mid 0 \leq \lambda_i \leq 1, \sum \lambda_i = 1}$, i.e. set of centers of gravity of masses placed at vertices.

They are affinely independent if there is a unique expression of every point in barycentric coordinates. $\sum v_i a_i = 0 \and \sum v_i = 0 \implies v_i = 0 ~\forall i$. It follows that if $\sum \lambda_i a_i = \sum \mu_i a_i$ then $\lambda_i = \mu_i ~\forall i$.

The *face* of an $n$-simplex are the subsets where the barycentric coordinates are 0. Consider a triangle with points $\lambda a, \mu b, \nu c$, then one edge is a face ($\lambda=0$), as is another $(\nu = 0$), as is the point $\mu b$ where $\nu  = \lambda = 0$.

A *simplicial complex* is a set $K$ of simplexes in $\RR^n$, say $K = \theset{\sigma_0, \sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_n}$, such that they are pasted together correctly, i.e.

1. $\sigma \in K \and \tau \subset \sigma \implies \tau \in K$
2. If $\sigma, \sigma' \in K$ then they overlap in a common face, i.e. either $\sigma \intersect \sigma' = \emptyset \or \sigma\intersect\sigma'$ is a face of both $\sigma,\sigma'$.

Given such a $K$, define $\abs{K} = \union_{\sigma\in K} \sigma \subseteq \RR^n$ a topological space.

A *triangulation* of a space $X$ is a homeomorphism $h: X \into \abs{K}$ for some $K$.

For example, $S^1 \cong $ a triangle (can't allow curved stuff or multiple edges!), has 6 simplexes

$S^2 \cong $ a tetrahedron with 14 simplexes

% This AMS package gives us a newtheorem command, which can be extended to define new environments of things that should logically be one piece - like a claim or definition. Each gets its own separate numbering, and allows you to reference it later on by label.
\newtheorem{defn}{Definition}
\newtheorem{claim}{Claim}

% Immediately using the 'defn' environment we made in the preamble:
\begin{defn}
A \textbf{topology} $\mathcal{T}$ on a set $X$, denoted $\mathcal{T}(X)$, is a subset of $2^X$ (the powerset of $X$) satisfying...
\end{defn}

\begin{claim}
Suppose $X$ is a set and $\mathcal{T}$ is a topology on $X$. Then $\mathcal{T}$ is great.
\end{claim}

% Proof inserts a nice square at the end of all of its content, aligned to the right - this is usually a stand-in for something like "Proof Completed", "QED", etc.
\begin{proof}
Left as an exercise for the reader.
\end{proof}

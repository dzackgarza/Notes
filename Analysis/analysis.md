Algebras are closed under complements, finite unions, and finite intersections.

$\sigma$-Algebras are Algebras that are closed under *countably infinite* intersections and unions.

$\sigma$-finite measures are measures for which $\exists \{A_i\}: A_i \uparrow \Omega$ where $\mu(A_i) < \infty$.



All measures are countably additive for disjoint sets

Finite measures are continuous from above and below for monotonic sequences of sets

Finite measures are countably subadditive for any sets

Not every finitely additive set function is measure.

Measures are defined on $\sigma$-Algebras, premeasures are defined on Algebras.

Premeasures are measures where additivity is restricted to sets whose union is still in the algebra.

Semi-algebras over $S$ can be extended to algebras by including all finite, disjoint unions of sets in $S$.

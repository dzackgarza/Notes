- Determining is a set is a subgroup:
	- Two step subgroup test: #todo

## Symmetric Group
- Generated by:
	- Transpositions
	- #todo
- Inversions: given $\tau = (p_1 \cdots p_n)$, a pair $p_i, p_j$ is *inverted* iff $i < j$ but $p_j < p_i$
- Can count inversions $N(\tau)
	- Equal to minimum number of transpositions to obtain non-decreasing permutation
- Sign of a permutation: $\sigma(\tau) = (-1)^{N(\tau)}$
- Parity of permutations $\cong (\ZZ, +)$
	- even $\circ$ even = even
	- odd $\circ$ odd = even
	- even $\circ$ odd = odd

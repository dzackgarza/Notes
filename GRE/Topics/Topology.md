- Open sets: closed under arbitrary unions, finite intersections
- Closed sets: closed under finite unions, arbitrary intersections
- Interior
- Exterior
- Boundary
- Limit Point
- Closure
- Connected
	- Space of connected sets closed under union, product
	- Convex $\implies$ connected
- Disconnected
- Path Connected
	- $\forall x,y \in X \exists f: I \to X \mid f(0) = x, f(1) = y$
	- Path connected $\implies$ connected
- Simply Connected
- Totally Disconnected

Example:
- The space $\theset{\frac{1}{n}}_{n\in \NN}$

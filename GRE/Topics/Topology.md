- Closure
- Connected
	- Space of connected sets closed under union, product, closures
	- Convex $\implies$ connected
- Disconnected
- Path Connected
	- $\forall x,y \in X \exists f: I \to X \mid f(0) = x, f(1) = y$
	- Path connected $\implies$ connected
- Simply Connected
- Totally Disconnected
- Hausdorff
- Compact
	- Every covering has a finite subcovering.
	- $X$ compact and $U \subset X: (U \text{ closed } \implies U \text{ compact })$
		- $U \text{ compact } \implies U \text{ closed }$ iff $X$ is Hausdorff
	- Closed under products

Example:
- The space $\theset{\frac{1}{n}}_{n\in \NN}$

List of properties preserved by continuous maps:
- Connectedness
- Compactness

Checking if a map is homeomorphism:
- $f$ continuous, $X$ compact and Hausdorff $\implies f$ is a homeomorphism.

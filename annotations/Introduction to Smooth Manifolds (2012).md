## Highlights

- Typically, volumes are computed by integration, and curvatures are computed by differentiation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Lee 16</a>)
- We say that M is a topological manifold of dimension n or a topological n-manifold if it has the following properties: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Lee 17</a>)
- Thus, we do not consider spaces of mixed dimension, such as the disjoint union of a plane and a line, to be manifolds at all (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Lee 18</a>)
- Theorem 1\.2 \(Topological Invariance of Dimension\)\. A nonempty n-dimensional topological manifold cannot be homeomorphic to an m-dimensional manifold unless m D n\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Lee 18</a>)
- The basic example of a topological n-manifold is Rn itself\. It is Hausdorff because it is a metric space, and it is second-countable because the set of all open balls with rational centers and rational radii is a countable basis for its topology\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Lee 18</a>)
- The motivation for second-countability is a bit less evident, but it will have important (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Lee 18</a>)
- I Exercise 1\.1\. Show that equivalent definitions of manifolds are obtained if instead n of allowing U to be homeomorphic to any open subset of Rn , we require it to be homeomorphic to an open ball in Rn , or to Rn itself\.

- it is easy to verify that in a Hausdorff space, finite subsets are closed and limits of convergent sequences are unique (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Lee 18</a>)
- M is a Hausdorff space: for every pair of distinct points p; q 2 M; there are disjoint open subsets U; V  M such that p 2 U and q 2 V \.  M is second-countable: there exists a countable basis for the topology of M \.  M is locally Euclidean of dimension n: each point of M has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of Rn \.

- In particular, it follows that every open subset of a topological nmanifold is itself a topological n-manifold \(with the subspace topology, of course\)\.

- both the Hausdorff and second-countability properties are usually easy to check, especially for spaces that are built out of other manifolds, because both properties are inherited by subspaces and finite products (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">Lee 19</a>)

- If \.U; '/ is any chart whose domain contains p, it is easy to obtain a new chart centered at p by subtracting the constant vector '\.p/\.

- connected if there do not exist two disjoint, nonempty, open subsets of X whose union is X ;  path-connected if every pair of points in X can be joined by a path in X ; and  locally path-connected if X has a basis of path-connected open subsets\.

- Proposition 1\.11\. Let M be a topological manifold\. \(a\) M is locally path-connected\. \(b\) M is connected if and only if it is path-connected\. \(c\) The components of M are the same as its path components\. \(d\) M has countably many components, each of which is an open subset of M and a connected topological manifold\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=23" target="_blank">Lee 23</a>)
- Proposition 1\.12 \(Manifolds Are Locally Compact\)\. Every topological manifold is locally compact\. Proof\. Lemma 1\.10 showed that every manifold has a basis of precompact open subsets\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Lee 24</a>)
- Let M be a topological space\. A collection X of subsets of M is said to be locally finite if each point of M has a neighborhood that intersects at most finitely many of the sets in X\. Given a cover U of M; another cover V is called a refinement of U if for each V 2 V there exists some U 2 U such that V  U \. We say that M is paracompact if every open cover of M admits an open, locally finite refinement\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Lee 24</a>)
- Theorem 1\.15 \(Manifolds Are Paracompact\)\. Every topological manifold is paracompact\. In fact, given a topological manifold M; an open cover X of M; and any basis B for the topology of M; there exists a countable, locally finite open refinement of X consisting of elements of B\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Lee 24</a>)
- at least for connected spaces, paracompactness can be used as a substitute for second-countability in the definition of manifolds\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Lee 24</a>)
- Another key topological property possessed by manifolds is called paracompactness\. It is a consequence of local compactness and second-countability, and in fact is one of the main reasons why second-countability is included in the definition of manifolds\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Lee 24</a>)

- the resulting cover is locally finite (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Lee 24</a>)
- Proposition 1\.16\. The fundamental group of a topological manifold is countable\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">Lee 25</a>)
- It follows that f is pathhomotopic to a special loop (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">Lee 25</a>)
- Define a special loop to be a loop based at p that is equal to a finite product of paths of the form hB x;x 0 \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">Lee 25</a>)

- To show that 1 \.M; p/ is countable, therefore, it suffices to show that each element of 1 \.M; p/ is represented by a special loop\.

- If U and V are open subsets of Euclidean spaces Rn and Rm , respectively, a function F W U ! V is said to be smooth \(or C 1 , or infinitely differentiable\) if each of its component functions has continuous partial derivatives of all orders\. If in addition F is bijective and has a smooth inverse map, it is called a diffeomorphism\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">Lee 26</a>)
- A diffeomorphism is, in particular, a homeomorphism\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">Lee 26</a>)
- There is a good reason for this: however we might try to make sense of derivatives of functions on a manifold, such derivatives cannot be invariant under For example, the map ' W R2 ! R2 given by der 1=3  1=3homeomorphisms\. 1=3 '\.u; v/ D u ; v is a homeomorphism, and it is easy to construct differentiable functions f W R2 ! R such that f ƒ± ' is not differentiable at the origin\. \(The function f \.x; y/ D x is one such\.\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">Lee 26</a>)
- there is no mention of calculus\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">Lee 26</a>)
- If \.U; '/, \.V; / are two charts such that U \ V ¬§ ¬ø, the composite map ƒ± ' 1 W '\.U \ V / ! \.U \ V / is called the transition map from ' to \(Fig\. 1\.6\)\. It is a composition of homeomorphisms, and is therefore itself a homeomorphism\. Two charts \.U; '/ and \.V; / are said to be smoothly compatible if either U \ V D ¬ø or the transition map ƒ± ' 1 is a diffeomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=27" target="_blank">Lee 27</a>)
- We define an atlas for M to be a collection of charts whose domains cover M \. An atlas A is called a smooth atlas if any two charts in A are smoothly compatible with each other\.

- To show that an atlas is smooth, we need only verify that each transition map ƒ± ' 1 is smooth whenever \.U; '/ and \.V; / are charts in A; once we have proved ver \.U; '/ and \.V; / are charts in A; once we have prov this, it follows that ƒ± ' 1 is a diffeomorphism because its inverse ƒ± ' 1 D ' ƒ± 1 is one of the transition maps we have already shown to be smooth\.

- Alternatively, given two particular charts \.U; '/ and \.V; /, it is often easiest to show that (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=27" target="_blank">Lee 27</a>)
- A plausible definition of a smooth function on M would be to say that f W M ! R is smooth if and only if the composite function f ƒ±' 1 W Uy ! R is smooth in the sense of ordinary calculus\. But this will make sense only if this property is independent of the choice of coordinate chart (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=27" target="_blank">Lee 27</a>)
- they are smoothly compatible by verifying that ƒ± ' 1 is smooth and injective with nonsingular Jacobian at each point, and appealing to Corollary C\.36\.

- there will be many possible atlases that give the ‚Äúsame‚Äù smooth structure, in that they all determine the same collection of smooth functions on M \. For example, consider the following pair of atlases on Rn : A 1 D Rn ; IdRn ; A Àö   2 D B1 \.x/; IdB1 \.x/ W x 2 Rn : (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Lee 28</a>)
- If M is a topological manifold, a smooth structure on M is a maximal smooth atlas\. A smooth manifold is a pair \.M; A/, where M is a topological manifold and A is a smooth structure on M \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Lee 28</a>)
- Proposition 1\.17\. Let M be a topological manifold\. \(a\) Every smooth atlas A for M is contained in a unique maximal smooth atlas, called the smooth structure determined by A\. \(b\) Two smooth atlases for M determine the same smooth structure if and only if their union is a smooth atlas\.

- a smooth atlas A on M is maximal if it is not properly contained in any larger smooth atlas\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Lee 28</a>)
- This just means that any chart that is smoothly compatible with every chart in A is already in A\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Lee 28</a>)

- We could choose to define a smooth structure as an equivalence class of smooth atlases under an appropriate equivalence relation\. However, it is more straightforward to make the following definition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Lee 28</a>)
- a function f W Rn ! R is smooth with respect to either atlas if and only if it is smooth in the sense of ordinary calculus\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Lee 28</a>)
- there exist topological manifolds that admit no smooth structures at all\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Lee 28</a>)
- It is generally not very convenient to define a smooth structure by explicitly describing a maximal smooth atlas, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Lee 28</a>)
- Fortunately, we need only specify some smooth atlas (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Lee 28</a>)

- class C k , we obtain the definition of a C k structure\. Similarly, if we require that each transition map be real-analytic (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Lee 30</a>)
- we obtain the definition of a real-analytic structure, also called a C ! structure (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Lee 30</a>)
- If M has even dimension n D 2m, we can identify R2m m with C m and require that the transition maps be complex-analytic; this determines a complex-analytic structure (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Lee 30</a>)
- A manifold endowed with one of these structures is k called a C k manifold, real-analytic manifold, or complex manifold, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Lee 30</a>)

- If M is a smooth manifold, any chart \.U; '/ contained in the given maximal smooth atlas is called a smooth chart, and the corresponding coordinate map ' is called a smooth coordinate ma (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Lee 30</a>)
- A smooth coordinate ball means a smooth coordinate domain whose image under a smooth coordinate map is a ball in Euclidean space\. A smooth coordinate cube is defined similarly (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Lee 30</a>)
- Because Bx is homeomorphic to Bxr \.0/, it is compact, and thus every regular coordinate ball is precompact in M (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Lee 30</a>)
- Proposition 1\.19\. Every smooth manifold has a countable basis of regular coordinate balls\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Lee 30</a>)
- We say a set B  M is a regular coordinate ball if there is a smooth coordinate ball B 0  Bx and a smooth coordinate map ' W B 0 !

- On an appropriate open subset such as U D f\.x; y/ W x > 0g  R2 , \.r; / can be expressed as smooth functions of \.x; y/, and the map that sends \.x; y/ to the corresponding \.r; / is a smooth coordinate map with respect to the standard smooth structure on R2 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">Lee 31</a>)
- Using this map, we can write a given point p 2 U either as p D \.x; y/ in standard coordinates or as p D \.r; / in polar where polar wher p coordinates,  the two coordinate representations are related by \.r; / D x 2 C y 2 ; tan1 y=x and \.x; y/ D \.r cos ; r sin  / (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">Lee 31</a>)
- Other polar coordinate charts can be obtained by restricting \.r; / to other open subsets of R2 X f0g\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">Lee 31</a>)
- But we pay for this flexibility by being obliged to ensure that any objects we wish to define globally on a manifold are not dependent on a particular choice of coordinates\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">Lee 31</a>)
- There are generally two ways of doing this: either by writing down a coordinate-dependent definition and then proving that the definition gives the same results in any coordinate chart, or by writing down a definition that is manifestly coordinate-independent \(often called an invariant definition\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">Lee 31</a>)
- One of the most important skills you will need to acquire in order to use manifold theory effectively is an ability to switch back and forth easily between invariant descriptions and their coordinate counterparts\.

- Any norm on V determines a topology, which is independent of the choice of norm (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=32" target="_blank">Lee 32</a>)
- A topological manifold M of dimension 0 is just a countable discrete space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=32" target="_blank">Lee 32</a>)

- Thus, the set of all charts on M trivially satisfies the smooth compatibility condition, and each 0-dimensional manifold has a unique smooth structure\.

- R n is a smooth n-manifold with the smooth structure determined by the atlas consisting of the single chart \.Rn ; IdRn /\. We call this the standard smooth structure n on Rn and the resulting coordinate map standard coordinates\.

- the smooth coordinate charts for Rn are exactly those charts \.U; '/ such that ' is a diffeomorphism \(in the sense of ordinary calculus\) from U to another open subset Uy  R (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=32" target="_blank">Lee 32</a>)
- The atlas consisting of the single chart \.R; / defines a smooth structure on R\. This chart is not smoothly compatible with the standard smooth structure, because the transition map IdR ƒ± 1 \.y/ D y 1=3 is not smooth at the origin\. Therefore, the smooth structure defined on R by is not the same as the standard one\.

- The collection of all such charts thus defines a smooth structure, called the standard smooth structure on V \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=33" target="_blank">Lee 33</a>)

- We interpret any such expression according to the following rule, called the Einstein summation convention: if the same index name \(such as i in the expression above\) appears exactly twice in any monomial term, once as an upper index and once as a lower index, that term is understood to be summed over all possible values of that index, generally from 1 to the dimension of the space in question (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=33" target="_blank">Lee 33</a>)
- We always write basis vectors \(such as Ei \) with lower indices, and components of a vector with respect to a basis \(such as x i \) with upper indices (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=33" target="_blank">Lee 33</a>)
- These index conventions help to ensure that, in summations that make mathematical sense, each index to be summed over typically appears twice in any given term, once as a lower index and once as an upper index (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=33" target="_blank">Lee 33</a>)
- Any index that is implicitly summed over is a ‚Äúdummy index,‚Äù meaning that the value of such an expression is unchanged if a different name is substituted for each dummy index\. For example, x i Ei and x j Ej mean exactly the same thing\.

- Yet another approach to defining the tangent space is based on the transformation rule \(3\.12\) for the components of tangent vectors in coordinates\. One defines at a point p 2 M to be a rule that assigns an ordered n-tuple v tangent vector 1 ; : : : ; v n 2 Rn to each smooth coordinate chart containing p, with the property that the n-tuples assigned to overlapping charts transform according to \(3\.12\)\.

- In this approach, the velocity of a curve is defined by the usual Euclidean formula in coordinates, and the differential of F W M ! N is defined as the linear map determined by the Jacobian matrix of F in coordinates\.

- Another common approach to tangent vectors is to define an intrinsic equivalence relation on the set of smooth curves with the same starting point, which captures the idea of ‚Äúhaving the same velocity,‚Äù and to define a tangent vector as an equivalence class of curve (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">Lee 87</a>)
- The germ definition has a number of advantages\.

- The definition we have chosen, however abstract it may seem at first, has several advantages: it is relatively concrete \(tangent 1 vectors are actual derivations of C 1 \.M /, with no equivalence classes involved\); it makes the vector space structure on Tp M obvious; and it leads to straightforward coordinate-independent definitions of differentials, velocities, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Lee/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) (736)/Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2012) - Lee.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">Lee 88</a>)

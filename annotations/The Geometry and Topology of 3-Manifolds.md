## Highlights

- it is not known\) that this is the only way S 3 can be obtained as a cyclic branched covering of itself over a knot (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 10</a>)
- Montesinos and Hilden \(independently\) showed that every oriented three-manifold is a branched cover of S 3 with 3 sheets, branched over some knot\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 10</a>)
- Every three-manifold can be obtained from two handlebodies \(of some genus\) by gluing their boundaries together\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 11</a>)
- such a complex is a manifold if and only if its Euler characteristic is zero\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 11</a>)
- There are three kinds of geometry which possess a notion of distance, and which look the same from any viewpoint with your head turned in any orientation: these are elliptic geometry \(or spherical geometry\), Euclidean or parabolic geometry, and hyperbolic or Lobachevskiian geometry (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 18</a>)
- The underlying spaces of these three geometries are naturally Riemannian manifolds of constant sectional curvature +1, 0, and −1, respectively\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 18</a>)
- Elliptic n-space is the n-sphere, with antipodal points identified (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 18</a>)
- Certain surfaces of revolution in R3 have constant curvature −1 and so give an idea of the local picture of the hyperbolic plane\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 19</a>)
- The simplest of these is the pseudosphere, the surface of revolution generated by a tractrix\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 19</a>)
- A tractrix is the track of a box of stones which starts at \(0, 1\) and is dragged by a team of oxen walking along the x-axis and pulling the box by a chain of unit length\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 19</a>)
- This model is conformally correct, that is, hyperbolic angles agree distances are greatly distorted\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 20</a>)
- If the two lines converge in the visual circle, this means that they meet on the circle at infinity, and they are called parallels\. Otherwise, the two lines are called ultraparallels (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=23" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 23</a>)
- The metric dx2 restricted to this hyperboloid is positive definite, and it is not hard to check that it has constant curvature −1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 26</a>)
- With our dictionary now complete, it is easy to derive hyperbolic trigonometric formulae from linear algebra\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 30</a>)
- A manifold is a topological space which is locally modelled on Rn \. The notion of what it means to be locally modelled on Rn can be made definite in many different ways, yielding many different sorts of manifolds\. In general, to define a kind of manifold, we need to define a set G of gluing maps which are to be permitted for piecing the manifold together out of chunks of Rn \. Such a manifold is called a Gmanifold\. G should satisfy some obvious properties which make it a pseudogroup of local homeomorphisms between open sets of Rn : (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 37</a>)
- For instance, given a constant λ > 1 consider an annulus of radii 1 and λ + ǫ\. Identify neighborhoods of the two boundary components by the map x → λx\. The resulting manifold, topologically, is T 2 \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 37</a>)
- Milnor showed that the only closed two-dimensional affine manifolds are tori and Klein bottles (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 38</a>)
- The main unsolved question about affine manifolds is whether in general an affine manifold has Euler characteristic zero\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 38</a>)
- Conjecture\. Every three-manifold with finite fundamental group has an elliptic structure\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 38</a>)
- If G is the group of isometries of Euclidean space E n , then a \(G, E n \)-manifold is called a Euclidean manifold, or often a flat manifold\. Bieberbach proved that a Euclidean manifold is finitely covered by a torus\. Furthermore, a Euclidean structure automatically gives an affine structure, and Bieberbach proved that closed Euclidean manifolds with the same fundamental group are equivalent as affine manifolds\. If G is the group O\(n + 1\) acting on elliptic space Pn \(or on S n \), then we obtain elliptic manifolds\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 38</a>)
- This conjecture is a stronger version of the Poincaré conjecture; we shall see the logic shortly\. All known three-manifolds with finite fundamental group certainly have elliptic structures\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=39" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 39</a>)
- For instance, any surface of negative Euler characteristic has a hyperbolic structure (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=39" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 39</a>)
- R\. Riley showed that the figure-eight knot complement has a hyperbolic structure \( (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=40" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 40</a>)
- the fundamental group of the complement of the (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=40" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 40</a>)
- figure-eight knot is isomorphic to a subgroup of index 12 in PSL2 \(Z[ω]\), where ω is a primitive cube root of unity\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=41" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 41</a>)
- holonomy of M \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 45</a>)
- \. For example, if G is the trivial group and X is closed then closed \(G, X\)-manifolds are precisely the finite-sheeted covers of X, and D is the covering projection\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 45</a>)
- Definition\. M is a complete \(G, X\)-manifold if D : ̃ M̃ → X is a covering map\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 45</a>)
- If X is similarly connected, then any complete \(G, X\)-manifold M may easily be reconstructed from the image Γ = H\(π1 \(M \)\) of the holonomy, as the quotient space X/Γ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 45</a>)
- Proposition 3\.6\. Let G be a group of analytic diffeomorphisms acting transitively on a manifold X, such that for any x ∈ X, the isotropy group Gx of x is compact\. Then every closed \(G, X\)-manifold M is complete\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 45</a>)
- If M is any closed \(G, X\)-manifold, then there is some ǫ > 0 such that the ǫ-ball in the Riemannian metric on M is always convex and contractible (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 46</a>)
- For example, any closed elliptic three-manifold has universal cover S 3 , so any simply-connected elliptic manifold is S 3 \. Every closed hyperbolic manifold or Euclidean manifold has universal cover hyperbolic three-space or Euclidean space\. Such manifolds are consequently determined by their holonomy (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 46</a>)
- A hyperbolic structure can be obtained by gluing two ideal triangles \(with all vertices on the circle at infinity\) in this pattern (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 46</a>)
- Similarly, if X is a point on the sphere at infinity, the horospheres “centered” at X are the surfaces orthogonal to all lines through X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 48</a>)
- One property which can be used to determine the spheres centered at a point X is the fact that such a sphere is orthogonal to all lines through X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 48</a>)
- To analyze what happens near the vertices of an ideal polyhedron when it is glued together, we need the notion of horospheres \(or, in the hyperbolic plane, they are called horocycles\.\) A horosphere has the limiting shape of a sphere in hyperbolic space, as the radius goes to infinity (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 48</a>)
- From this picture one easily sees that a horosphere in H n is isometric to Euclidean space E n−1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=49" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 49</a>)
- \. It is easy to see from the Gauss-Bonnet theorem that any similarity two-manifold has Euler characteristic zero\. \(Its tangent bundle has a flat orthogonal connection\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=52" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 52</a>)
- Theorem 4\.7\. Every manifold obtained by Dehn surgery along the figure-eight knot K has a hyperbolic structure, except the six manifolds: \(S 3 − K\)\(µ,λ\) = \(S 3 − K\)\(±µ,±λ\) where \(µ, λ\) is \(1, 0\), \(0, 1\), \(1, 1\), \(2, 1\), \(3, 1\) or \(4, 1\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=72" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 72</a>)
- The statement of the theorem is meant to suggest, but not imply, the true fact that the six exceptions do not have hyperbolic structures (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=72" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 72</a>)
- Definition 4\.8\.1\. A codimension-k foliation of an n-manifold M is a G-structure, on M , where G is the pseudogroup of local homeomorphisms of Rn−k ×Rk which 4\.23 have the local form φ\(x, y\) = \(f \(x, y\), g\(y\)\)\. In other words, G takes horizontal \(n − k\)-planes to horizontal \(n − k\)-planes\. In other words, G takes horizontal \(n − k\)-planes to horizontal \(n − k\)-planes\. These horizontal planes piece together in M as \(n − k\)-submanifolds, called the leaves of the foliation\. M , like a book without its cover, is a disjoint union of its leaves\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=72" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 72</a>)
- Definition\. An H-foliation is complete if the developing map is a fibration\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 75</a>)
- Any three-manifold with a complete codimension-2 hyperbolic foliation has universal cover H 2 × R, and covering transformations act as global isometries in the first coordinate (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 75</a>)
- A Seifert fibration of a three-manifold M is a projection p : M → B to some surface B, so that p is a submersion and the preimages of points are circles in M \. A Seifert fibration is a fibration except at a certain number of singular points x1 , \. \. \. , xk \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 75</a>)
- The model for the behavior in p −1 \(Nǫ \(xi \)\) is a solid torus with a foliation having the core circle as one leaf, and with all other leaves winding p times around the short way and q times around the long way, where 1 < p < q and \(p, q\) = 1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 75</a>)
- A discrete group Γ of orientation-preserving isometries of a surface N has quotient N/Γ a surface (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 75</a>)
- prove the following: Proposition 4\.9\.3\. If g : H 2 → H 2 is a non-trivial isometry of H 2 which preserves orientation, then exactly one of the following cases occurs: \(i\) g has a unique interior fixed point or \(ii\) g leaves a unique invariant geodesic or \(iii\) g has a unique fixed point on the boundary of H 2 \. Case \(i\) is called elliptic, case \(ii\) hyperbolic, case \(iii\) parabolic (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 78</a>)
- Then S is incompressible if every loop \(simple closed curve\) on S which bounds an \(open\) disk in M − S also bounds a disk in S\. Some people prefer the alternate, stronger definition that S is \(strongly\) incompressible if π1 \(S\) injects into π1 \(M \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 82</a>)
- If M is oriented and irreducible \(every two-sphere bounds a ball\), then M is sufficiently large if it contains an incompressible and ∂-incompressible surface\. A 4\.39 compact, oriented, irreducible, sufficiently large three-manifold is also called a Hakenmanifold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 82</a>)
- The only previously known examples are certain Seifert fibered spaces over S 2 with three exceptional fibers\. In what follows we give the first known examples of compact, irreducible three-manifolds which are not Haken-manifolds and are not Seifert fiber spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 82</a>)
- Theorem 4\.11\. Every incompressible and ∂-incompressible connected surface in M is isotopic to one of S1 through S6 \. Corollary\. The Dehn surgery manifold M\(m,l\) is irreducible, and it is a Hakenmanifold if and only if \(m, l\) = \(0, ±1\) or \(±4, ±1\)\. In particular, none of the hyperbolic manifolds obtained from M by Dehn surgery is sufficiently large\. \(Compare 4\.7\.\) Thus we have an infinite family of examples of oriented, irreducible, non-Haken-manifolds which are not Seifert fiber spaces\. It seems likely that Dehn surgery along other knots and links would yield many more examples\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 84</a>)
- In this section we will derive some information about the global structure of the space of hyperbolic structures on a closed, oriented surface M \. This space is called the Teichmüller space of M and is defined to be the set of hyperbolic structures on M where two are equivalent if there is an isometry homotopic to the identity between them\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 100</a>)
- A distinction is often made between “loxodromic” and “hyperbolic” transformations in dimension 3\. In this usage a loxodromic transformation means an isometry which is a pure translation along a geodesic followed by a non-trivial twist, while a hyperbolic transformation means a pure translation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 100</a>)
- Proposition 5\.3\.1\. On any closed hyperbolic n-manifold M there is a unique, closed geodesic in any non-trivial free homotopy class (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 100</a>)
- Now we are in a position to describe the Teichmüller space for a closed surface\. The coordinates given below are due to Nielsen and Fenchel\. Pick 3g − 3 disjoint, non-parallel simple closed curves on M 2 \. \(This is the maximum number of such curves on a surface of genus g\.\) Take the corresponding geodesics and cut along them\. This divides M 2 into 2g − 2 surfaces homeomorphic to S 2 —three disks \(called “pairs of pants” from now on\) with geodesic boundary\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=101" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 101</a>)
- Proposition 5\.3\.2\. Two distinct geodesics in the universal cover H n of M which are invariant by two covering translations have distinct endpoints at ∞\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=101" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 101</a>)
- This information leads to an easy computation of the Teichmüller space of P \. Proposition 5\.3\.4\. T\(P \) is homeomorphic to R3 with coordinates \(log l1 , log l2 , log l3 \), where li = length of the i-th boundary component\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=102" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 102</a>)
- Remark\. If a hyperbolic surface is cut along a closed geodesic and glued back together with a twist of 2πn degrees \(n an integer\), then the resulting surface is isometric to the original one\. However, the isometry is not isotopic to the identity so the two surfaces represent distinct points in Teichmüller space\. Another way to say this is that they are isometric as surfaces but not as marked surfaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=103" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 103</a>)
- Theorem 5\.3\.5\. The Teichmüller space T\(M \) of a closed surface of genus g is homeomorphic to R6g−6 \. There are explicit coordinates for T\(M \), namely \(log l1 , τ1 , log l2 , τ2 , \. \. \. , log l3g−3 , τ3g−3 \), where li is the length and τi the twist coefficient for a system of 3g − 3 simple closed 5\.13 geodesics\.

- The definition of Teichmüller space can be extended to general surfaces as the space of all metrics of constant curvature up to isotopy and change of scale\.

- Geometric Corollary 5\.4\.2\. Any complete hyperbolic manifold M 3 whose fundamental group is generated by two elements a and b admits an involution s \(an isometry of order 2 \) which takes a to a−1 and b to b−1 \. If the generators are conjugate, there is a Z2 ⊕ Z2 action on M generated by s together with an involution t which interchanges a and b unless a and b have a common fixed point at infinity\.

- Remark\. Actually, it can be shown that when ∂M 6= 0, a representation ρ : π1 M → PSL\(2, C\) is the holonomy of some hyperbolic structure for M if and only if it lifts to a representation in SL\(2, C\)\. \(The obstruction to lifting is the second Stiefel–Whitney class ω2 of the associated H 3 -bundle over M \.\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- Since the universal cover of a hyperbolic manifold is H n , it is a K\(π, 1\)\. Two such manifolds are homotopy equivalent if and only if there is an isomorphism between their fundamental groups\. Corollary 5\.7\.3\. If M1 and M2 are hyperbolic manifolds which are complete with finite volume, then they are homeomorphic if and only if they are homotopy equivalent\. \(The case of dimension two is well known\.\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- For any manifold M , there is a homomorphism Diff M → Out\(π1 M \), where Out\(π1 M \) = Aut\(π1 M \)/ Inn\(π1 M \) is the group of outer automorphisms\. Mostow’s Theorem implies this homomorphism splits, if M is a hyperbolic manifold of dimension n ≥ 3\. It is unknown whether the homomorphism splits when M is a surface\. sion n ≥ 3\. It is unknown whether the homomorphism splits when M is a surface\. When n = 2 the kernel Diff 0 \(M \) is contractible, provided χ\(M \) ≤ 0\. If M is a Haken 5\.31 three-manifold which is not a Seifert fiber space, Hatcher has shown that Diff 0 M is contractible\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- Theorem 5\.9\.8\. For a closed, hyperbolic n-manifold M , π1 M acts ergodically on n−1 S∞ , i\.e\., every measurable, invariant set has zero measure or full measure\.

- Since π1 M1 acts on n−1 S∞ conformally and e is invariant under conformal maps, e is a measurable, π1 M1 n−1 invariant function on S∞ \. However, such functions are very simple because of the following theorem: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=123" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 123</a>)
- n−1 Theorem 5\.9\.10\. π1 \(M \) acts ergodically on S∞ n−1 n−1 ∞ × S∞ \. Remark\. This theorem is equivalent to the fact that the geodesic flow of M is n−1 ergodic since pairs of distinct points on S∞ are in a one-to-one correspondence to n geodesics in H \(whose endpoints are those points\)\.

- Now one must again invoke the theorem, from analysis, that a quasi-conformal map whose derivative is conformal a\.e\. is conformal in the usual sense; it is a spheren−1 preserving map of S∞ , so it extends to an isometry I of H n \. The isometry I conjugates the action of π1 M1 to the action of π1 M2 , completing the proof of Mostow’s Theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- Lemma 5\.10\.1 \(The Margulis Lemma\)\. For every dimension n there is an ǫ > 0 such that for every discrete group Γ of isometries of H n and for every x ∈ H n , Γ′ǫ \(x\) is abelian and Γǫ \(x\) has an abelian subgroup of finite index\. Remark\. This proposition is much more general than stated; if “abelian” is replaced by “nilpotent,” it applies in general to discrete groups of isometries of Riemannian manifolds with bounded curvature\. The proof of the general statement is essentially the same (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- describes the structure of the set of all complete hyperbolic three-manifolds with volume bounded by a constant C: Theorem 5\.11\.2 \(Jørgensen’s theorem [first version]\)\. Let C > 0 be any constant\. Among all complete hyperbolic three-manifolds with volume ≤ C, there are only finitely many homeomorphism types of M[ǫ,∞\) \. In other words, there is a link Lc in S 3 such that every complete hyperbolic manifold with volume ≤ C is obtained by Dehn surgery along LC \. \(The limiting case of deleting components of LC to obtain a non-compact manifold is permitted\.\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- With somewhat more effort, we obtain Jørgensen’s theorem, which beautifully describes the structure of the set of all complete hyperbolic three-manifolds with (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- Any two hyperbolic manifolds M and N such that M[ǫ,∞\) = N[ǫ,∞\) can be obtained from one another by Dehn surgery\. All manifolds with volume ≤ C can therefore be obtained from a fixed finite set of manifolds by Dehn surgery on a fixed link in each manifold\. Each member of this set can be obtained by Dehn surgery on some link in S 3 , so all manifolds with volume ≤ C can be obtained from S 3 by Dehn surgery on the disjoint union of all the relevant links (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- üller space\. Mostow’s Theorem implies that every closed manifold M in H is an isolated point, since M[ǫ,∞\) = M when ǫ is small enough (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 130</a>)
- On the other hand, a manifold in H with one end or cusp is a limit point, by the hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem 5\.9\. A manifold with two ends is a limit point of limit points and a manifold with k ends is a k-fold limit point (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- Thus we obtain the inequality area \( ∂ solid torus\) volume \(solid torus\) = 1 2 sinh r0 cosh r0 < 1 2 \. The limiting case as r0 → ∞ can be computed similarly; the ratio is 1/2\. Applying 5\.61 this to M , we have 1 5\.11\.2\. volume \(M \) ≤ volume \(M[ǫ,∞\) \) + 2 area \(∂M[ǫ,∞\) \)\. It follows easily that v is a continuous function on H\.

- Theorem 5\.12\.1\. The function v : H → R+ is proper\. In other words, every sequence in H with bounded volume has a convergent subsequence\. For every C, there is a finite set M1 , \. \. \. , Mk of complete hyperbolic manifolds with volume ≤ C there is a finite set M1 , \. \. \. , Mk of complete hyperbolic manifolds with volume ≤ C such that all other complete hyperbolic manifolds with volume ≤ C are obtained from this set by the process of hyperbolic Dehn surgery \(as in 5\.9\)\.

- Note\. Gromov proved that in dimensions n 6= 3, there is only a finite number of complete hyperbolic manifolds with volume less than a given constant\. He proved this more generally for negatively curved Riemannian manifolds with curvature varying between two negative constants\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- Gromov also gave a weaker version of hyperbolic Dehn surgery, 5\.8\.2: he showed that many of the manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery can be given metrics of negative curvature close to −1\.

- Gromov’s norm on the real singular homology \(really it is only a pseudo-norm\) is obtained from this norm on cycles by passing to homology: if a ∈ Hk \(X; R\) is any homology class, then the norm of α is defined to be the infimum of the norms of cycles representing α, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- Example\. The n-sphere n ≥ 1 admits maps f : S n → S n of degree 2 \(and higher\)\. As a consequence of 6\.1\.2 k [S n ] k = 0\. More explicitly, one may picture a sequence {zi } representing the fundamental class of S 1 , where zi is \( il \)σi and σi wraps a 1-simplex i times around S 1 \. Since kzi k = 1i , k [S 1 ] k = 0\.

- For k = 2, there is only one ideal simplex up to isometry\. We have seen that 2 copies of the ideal triangle fit inside a compact surface \(§3\.9\)\.

- Gromov gave a very quick proof of Mostow’s theorem for hyperbolic three-manifolds, based on 6\.2\. The proof would work for hyperbolic n-manifolds if it were known that the regular ideal n-simplex were the unique simplex of maximal volume (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- Lemma 6\.3\.1\. If M1 and M2 are homotopy equivalent, closed, oriented hyperbolic manifolds, then v\(M1 \) = v\(M2 \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- If M is a manifold and A ⊂ M a submanifold, the relative chain group Ck \(M, A\) is defined to be the quotient Ck \(M \)/Ck \(A\)\. The norm on Ck \(M \) goes over to a norm on Ck \(M, A\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- Gromov’s invariant of a compact, oriented norm kγk of a homology class γ ∈ Hk \(M, A\) is defined, as before, to be the infimal norm of relative cycles representing γ\. Gromov’s invariant of a compact, oriented manifold with boundary \(M, ∂M \) is [M, ∂M ] , where [M, ∂M ] denotes the relative fundamental cycle\.

- For any finite sheeted covering space p : M̃ → M there is a canonical chain map, transfer: C∗ \(M \) → C∗ \(M̃ \)\. The transfer of a singular simplex is simply the average of its lifts to ̃ M̃ ; this extends in an obvious way to measures on singular simplices\.

- With 6\.5\.5 combined with 6\.5\.2, one can compute Gromov’s invariant for any manifold which is obtained from Seifert fiber spaces and complete hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume by identifying along incompressible tori\.

- Theorem 6\.5\.6\. Suppose M1 is a complete hyperbolic manifold of finite volume and that M2 6= M1 is a complete hyperbolic manifold obtained topologically by replacing certain cusps of M1 by solid tori\. Then v\(M1 \) > v\(M2 \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P.

- Closed oriented surfaces can be arranged very neatly in a single sequence, in terms of their Euler characteristic\. What happens when we arrange all hyperbolic three-manifolds in terms of their volume? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=151" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 151</a>)
- follows that the set of volumes is a closed subset of R+ \. Furthermore, by combining Jørgensen’s theorem with the relative version of Gromov’s theorem, 6\.5\.4, we obtain Corollary 6\.6\.1\. The set of volumes of hyperbolic three-manifolds is well-ordered\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=152" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 152</a>)
- Corollary 6\.6\.2\. The volume is a finite-to-one function of hyperbolic manifolds\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=152" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 152</a>)
- a convergent sequence of manifolds with non-increasing volume must be eventually constant\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=152" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 152</a>)
- In view of these results, the volumes of complete hyperbolic manifolds are indexed by countable ordinals\. In other words, there is a smallest volume v1 , a next smallest volume v2 , and so forth\. This sequence v1 < v2 < v3 < · · · < vk < · · · has a limit point vω , which is the smallest volume of a complete hyperbolic manifold with one cusp\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=152" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 152</a>)
- It would be very interesting if a computer study could determine some of the low volumes, such as v1 , v2 , vω , vω2 \. It seems plausible that some of these might come from Dehn surgery on the Borromean rings\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=152" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 152</a>)
- There is some constant C such that every manifold with k cusps has volume ≥ C ·k\. This follows from the analysis in 5\.11\.2: the number of boundary components of M[ǫ, ∞\) is bounded by the number of disjoint ǫ/2 balls which can fit in M \. It would be interesting to calculate or estimate the best constant C (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=152" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 152</a>)
- Corollary 6\.6\.3\. The set of values of Gromov’s invariant k [ ] k0 on the class of connected manifolds obtained from Seifert fiber spaces and complete hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume by identifying along incompressible tori is a closed wellordered subset of R+ , with order type ω ω \. We shall see later \(§ \) that this class contains all Haken manifolds with toral boundaries\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- Definition 6\.7\.1\. If Γ1 and Γ2 are two discrete subgroups of isometries of H n , then Γ1 is commensurable with Γ2 if Γ1 is conjugate \(in the group of isometries of H n \) to a group Γ′1 1 such that Γ′ ∩ Γ2 has finite index in Γ′1 and in Γ2 \. Definition 6\.7\.2\. Two manifolds M1 and M2 are commensurable if they have finited sheeted covers ̃ M̃1 and ̃ M̃2 which are homeomorphic\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- Example 6\.7\.3\. If W is the Whitehead link and B is the Borromean rings, then S 3 − W has a four-sheeted cover homeomorphic with a two sheeted cover of S 3 − B: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- Proposition 6\.7\.3\. If M1 is a complete hyperbolic manifold with finite volume and M2 is commensurable with M1 , then M2 is homotopy equivalent to a complete hyperbolic manifold\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=154" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 154</a>)
- Waldhausen proved that two Haken manifolds which are homotopy equivalent are homeomorphic, so this would follow whenever M1 is Haken\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=155" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 155</a>)
- so this would follow whenever M1 is Haken\. There are some sorts of properties of three-manifolds which do not change under passage to a finite-sheeted cover\. For this reason \(and for its own sake\) it would be interesting to have a better understanding of the commensurability relation among three-manifolds\. This is difficult to approach from a purely topological point of view, but there is a great deal of information about commensurability given by a hyperbolic structure\. For instance, in the case of a complete non-compact (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=155" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 155</a>)
- hyperbolic three-manifold M of finite volume, each cusp gives a canonical Euclidean structure on a torus, well-defined up to similarity (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=155" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 155</a>)
- Proposition 6\.7\.4\. If Γ is a discrete subgroup of PSL\(2, C\) such that H 3 /Γ has finite volume, then Γ is conjugate to a group of matrices whose entries are algebraic (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=156" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 156</a>)
- One can ask the more subtle question, whether all entries can be made algebraic integers\. Hyman Bass has proved the following remarkable result regarding this question: Theorem 6\.7\.5 \(Bass\)\. Let M be a complete hyperbolic three-manifold of finite volume\. Then either π1 \(M \) is conjugate to a subgroup of PSL\(2, O\), where O is the ring of algebraic integers, or M contains a closed incompressible surface \(not homotopic to a cusp\)\.

- \. As an example, very few knot complements seem to contain non-trivial closed incompressible surfaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- If two manifolds are commensurable, then their volumes have a rational ratio\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

- From Milnor’s formula \(6\), p\. 7\.15, for the volume, we can compute some values\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

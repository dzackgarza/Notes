## Highlights

- the Whitehead theorem which states that \.fW X ! Y is a homotopy equivalence if and only if f is an isomorphism on homotopy groups—cf\. Sect\. 9\.2 for a proof\) is true (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 16</a>)
- if X ¤ X\.n/ for any n \(thus X is infinite dimensional\), then X has the weak topology with respect to the X\.n/ ’s meaning that U  X is an open set if and only if U \ X\.n/ is open for all n\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 17</a>)
- Also, a map fW X ! Y from a CW complex to a space is continuous if and only if its restriction to each skeleton X\.n/ is continuous (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 17</a>)
- \. Any simplicial complex K has the natural structure of a CW complex\. The n-cells of this CW structure are exactly the n-simplices\. Conversely, if X is a CW complex, then there is a simplicial complex K and a homotopy equivalence from K to X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 18</a>)
- A CW pair \.X; A/ is a pair of spaces A  X such that X is obtained from A by attaching cells (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 18</a>)
- \.Of course, as we have already remarked, any simplicial complex is a CW complex\. The converse is true up to homotopy\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 20</a>)
- It is frequently easier to work with an inclusion rather than an arbitrary map\. This is always possible up to homotopy equivalence\. Theorem 2\.3\. Given fW X ! Y, there is a space Mf , the mapping cylinder of f, inclusions jW X ! Mf and iW Y ! Mf , and a map W Mf ! Y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 20</a>)
- f\. Thus, we may replace Y by a homotopy equivalent space in which X is included\.\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=21" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 21</a>)
- Thus, we may consider any map as an inclusion without leaving the category of CW complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=21" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 21</a>)
- \. If W E ! B has the h\. l\. p\. \(D homotopy lifting property\), then it is said to be a fibration\. For any b 2 B, the fiber Fb D l \(b\) is the preimage of the point\. In a fibration, any two fibers are homotopy equivalent provided that the base is path connected (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=21" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 21</a>)

- is perfect on the quotients of these homology groups by their torsion subgroups\. This is called the intersection pairing (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 29</a>)
- \. For a smooth manifold, the fundamental class ŒM 2 Hn \.M/ can be described as follows (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 29</a>)
- meet transversely\. This means that the intersection is a finite set of points and at each intersection point the tangent spaces of the two simplices are complementary subspaces in the tangent space of M (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 29</a>)
- \. This pairing is called the linking pairing\.

- In dealing with spaces that are not CW complexes, a map fW X ! Y is not necessarily a homotopy equivalence if it induces an isomorphism in all homotopy groups\. When it does, we say that f is a weak homotopy equivalence\. This is not an equivalence relation, but it generates an equivalence relation weak homotopy equivalence which when restricted to CW complexes is homotopy equivalence by Whitehead’s theorem\.

- Before Sullivan’s work on differential forms and rational homotopy theory, in [19] Quillen had established algebraic models for rational homotopy theory\. Quillen worked dually from the way Sullivan does: Instead of using differential forms as the basic model, Quillen uses differential graded Lie algebras\. One can, as Quillen does, associate a differential graded, co-commutative co-algebra to a differential graded Lie algebra\. Dualizing this produces a differential graded algebra computing the rational homotopy type and thus in some sense solves the rational commutative cochain problem\. Sullivan’s construction was much more directly tied to differential forms on the space, whereas Quillen’s went through more homotopy theoretic constructions, i\.e\., the simplicial set \(of singular simplices\) associated with the loop space of the given space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=168" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 168</a>)

- There are many variants of the bar construction\.

- Quillen passes from the category of reduced simplicial groups to the category of reduced simplicial Hopf algebras over Q that are complete with respect to the augmentation ideal\.

- \. This passage is the application of the simplicial functor to the b map that associates to a group the completion QG of the rational group ring QG with respect to the augmentation ideal\. Since G0 D feg, the simplicial Hopf algebra with respect to the augmentation ideal (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)
- There is an adjoint to this functor that associates to a reduced, complete Hopf algebra its group of group-like elements (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)
- Lastly, we pass from a simplicial Lie algebra to a differential graded Lie algebra as follows (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)
- This then is Quillen’s functorial assignment of a DGLA to a simply connected topological space\. As we have already remarked, we can apply the bar construction to pass from a DGLA to a co-commutative, co-associative co-algebra and then by duality to a DGA\. The resulting DGA has the same minimal model as the p\.l\. forms on a simplicial complex homotopy equivalent to X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=179" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 179</a>)
- These developments began with A1 -spaces and A1 -structures in the 1960s and have been developed in the intervening years to what now goes under the name of the theory of operads (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=180" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 180</a>)
- intervening years to what now goes under the name of the theory of operads\. One of the first results of this theory was Stasheff’s characterization [24] of those topological spaces that are homotopy equivalent to loop spaces as being A1 -spaces\. \(Indeed, an A1 -structure on a space determines the homotopy type of its classifying space, that is to say, its de-looping\.\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=180" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 180</a>)
- These ideas, originating in homotopy theory, have also been crucial recently for developments in symplectic geometry, in particular in formulating the symplectic side of the mirror symmetry conjecture which originated in physics\. One now formulates the appropriate object associated to a symplectic manifold as an A1 -category of Lagrangian submanifolds of the symplectic manifold, the Fukaya category (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=180" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 180</a>)
- An \(nonsymmetric\) operad is a collection of sets fPn gn1 together with functions, defined for each \.n; j/  1 and i with 1  i  n, OŒ\.n; j/I iW Pj  Pn ! PnCj1 and also a distinguished element 1 2 P1 that acts as a unit for the operations OŒ\.n; 1/I i  for every 1  i  n\. These operations are required to satisfy the following natural composition axioms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=181" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 181</a>)

- Definition\. Given an operad P D fPn g, the set X is an algebra over the operad if there is a morphism of operads from P ! End\.X/\. Said another way, for each pn 2 Pn determines a function f\.pn /W Xn ! X in such a way that under this correspondence the structure maps of the operad P are mapped to the corresponding compositions of functions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=182" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 182</a>)
- A space X is an algebra over the associahedron operad if there are continuous maps Kn  Xn ! X compatible with the structure maps of the operad\. Said another way, End\.X/ is naturally an operad of topological spaces and X is an algebra over the associahedron operad if there is a map of topological operads K ! End\.X/\. These objects are also called A1 -spaces\.

- Stasheff not only introduced the associahedra, he proved that an A1 -space X has a classifying space BX, so that an A1 -space is a loop space \(up to homotopy equivalence\)\.

- There is an algebraic version of A1 -spaces called A1 -algebras\. These algebras can be defined as algebras \(in the category of graded vector spaces\) over the operad in the induced category of differential graded vector spaces consisting of cellular chain complexes of the associahedra with the induced structure maps from the associahedra operad \(thought of as an operad in the category of cell complexes and cellular maps\)\.

An A1 -algebra is a graded vector space V, and for every n  1, a map (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=184" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 184</a>)
- The motivating example occurs in [6]\. The objects formalized from what they did are called Fukaya categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=185" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 185</a>)
- The motivating example was to formalize the algebraic structure associated with the Lagrangian Floer homology of a symplectic manifold\.

- Given a symplectic manifold M, we form an A1 -category whose objects are Lagrangian submanifolds of M\. For Lagrangian submanifolds L and L 0 by definition, Hom\.L; L 0 / is the Floer cochain complex CF\.L; L 0 /\.

- Under suitable hypotheses \(see [20] for one such context\), these structure maps produce an A1 -category structure, which is the Fukaya category of this symplectic manifold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=186" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 186</a>)
- To do this we introduce the graded-commutative analogue of A1 -algebras; see [10]\. These are the so-called C1 -algebras\. They are the quotient of A1 -algebras when one forces graded commutativity (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=186" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 186</a>)

- Let A  be a DGA\. We can view this as a C1 -algebra with m1 D d, with m2 being the multiplication in the algebra, and with mi D 0 for all i > 2\. We have the following theorem of Kadeishvili [10]\. It says that up to homotopy equivalence, we can collapse A  onto its cohomology at the expense of endowing the cohomology with a possibly nontrivial C1 -structure\.

- There is an analogous theorem in the noncommutative case that says a \(not necessarily commutative\) DGA is equivalent in an appropriate homotopy category to an A1 -algebra structure on its cohomology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=188" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 188</a>)

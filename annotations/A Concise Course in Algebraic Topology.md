## Highlights

- A treatment more closely attuned to the needs of algebraic geometers and analysts would include Č Čech cohomology on the one hand and de Rham cohomology and perhaps Morse homology on the other\. A treatment more closely attuned to the needs of algebraic topologists would include spectral sequences and an array of calculations with them (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=9" target="_blank">J. Peter May 9</a>)
- These changes reflect in part an enormous internal development of algebraic topology over this period, one which is largely unknown to most other mathematicians, even those working in such closely related fields as geometric topology and algebraic geometry (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=9" target="_blank">J. Peter May 9</a>)
- The study of generalized homology and cohomology theories pervades modern algebraic topology\. These theories satisfy the excision axiom\. One constructs most such theories homotopically, by constructing representing objects called spectra, and one must then prove that excision holds\. There is a way to do this in general that is no more difficult than the standard verification for singular homology and cohomology\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=9" target="_blank">J. Peter May 9</a>)
- A defect of nearly all existing texts is that they do not go far enough into the subject to give a feel for really substantial applications: the reader sees spheres and projective spaces, maybe lens spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">J. Peter May 10</a>)
- A function p : X −→ Y is continuous if it takes nearby points to nearby points\. Precisely, p−1 \(U \) is open if U is open\. If X and Y are metric spaces, this means that, for any x ∈ X and ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that p\(Uδ \(x\)\) ⊂ Uε \(p\(x\)\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">J. Peter May 13</a>)
- The further one goes in the subject, the more elaborate become the constructions A and the more horrendous become the relevant calculational techniques (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">J. Peter May 13</a>)
- Let X be a space\. Two paths f, g : I −→ X from x to y are equivalent if they are homotopic through paths from x to y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">J. Peter May 14</a>)
- Now suppose given two maps p, q : X −→ Y and a homotopy h : p ≃ q\. We would like to conclude that p∗ = q∗ , but this doesn’t quite make sense because homotopies needn’t respect basepoints (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">J. Peter May 15</a>)
- Theorem\. π1 \(S 1 , 1\) ∼ = Z\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">J. Peter May 16</a>)
- the first map induces the evident identification of I/∂I with S 1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">J. Peter May 17</a>)
- This lifting of paths works generally\. For any path f : I −→ S 1 with f \(0\) = 1, there is a unique path ˜ f˜ : I −→ R such that ˜ f˜\(0\) = 0 and p ◦ f ˜ f˜ = f \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">J. Peter May 17</a>)
- The Brouwer fixed point theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">J. Peter May 18</a>)
- Proposition\. There is no continuous map r : D 2 −→ S 1 such that r ◦ i = id\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">J. Peter May 18</a>)
- Theorem \(Brouwer fixed point theorem\)\. Any continuous map f : D 2 −→ D 2 has a fixed point\. Proof\. Suppose that f \(x\) 6= x for all x\. Define r\(x\) ∈ S 1 to be the intersection with S 1 of the ray that starts at f \(x\) and passes through x\. Certainly r\(x\) = x if x ∈ S 1 \. By writing an equation for r in terms of f , we see that r is continuous\. This contradicts the proposition\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">J. Peter May 18</a>)
- Theorem \(Fundamental theorem of algebra\)\. Let f \(x\) = x n + c1 x n−1 + · · · + cn−1 x + cn be a polynomial with complex coefficients ci , where n > 0\. Then there is a complex number x such that f \(x\) = 0\. Therefore there are n such complex numbers \(counted with multiplicities\)\. Proof\. Using f \(x\)/\(x−c\) for a root c, we see that the last statement will follow by induction from the first (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">J. Peter May 18</a>)
- Then h is a homotopy from the constant map at f \(0\)/|f \(0\)| to f ˆ fˆ, and we conclude that deg\( ˆ fˆ\) = 0\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">J. Peter May 18</a>)
- 3\. Natural transformations A natural transformation α : F −→ G between functors C −→ D is a map of functors\. It consists of a morphism αA : F \(A\) −→ G\(A\) for each object A of C such that the following diagram commutes for each morphism f : A −→ B of C : (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)
- For example, if F : S −→ A b is the functor that sends a set to the free Abelian group that it generates and U : A b −→ S is the forgetful functor that sends an Abelian group to its underlying set, then we have a natural inclusion of sets S −→ U F \(S\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)
- The functors F and U are left adjoint and right adjoint to each other, in the sense that we have a natural isomorphism A b\(F \(S\), A\) ∼ = ∼ = S \(S, U \(A\)\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)
- for a set S and an Abelian group A\. This just expresses the “universal property” of free objects: a map of sets S −→ U \(A\) extends uniquely to a homomorphism of groups F \(S\) −→ A\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)
- The fundamental group is a homotopy invariant functor on T , in the sense that it factors through a functor hT −→ G \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)
- When we have a \(suitable\) relation of homotopy between maps in a category C , we define the homotopy category hC to be the category with the same objects as C but with morphisms the homotopy classes of maps (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)
- A homotopy equivalence in U is an isomorphism in hU \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)
- Less mysteriously, a map f : X −→ Y is a homotopy equivalence if there is a map g : Y −→ X such that both g ◦ f ≃ id and f ◦ g ≃ id\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)
- Functors carry isomorphisms to isomorphisms, so we see that a based homotopy equivalence induces an isomorphism of fundamental groups\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)
- Proposition\. If f : X −→ Y is a homotopy equivalence, then f∗ : π1 \(X, x\) −→ π1 \(Y, f \(x\)\) is an isomorphism for all x ∈ X\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)
- A space X is said to be contractible if it is homotopy equivalent to a point\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=23" target="_blank">J. Peter May 23</a>)
- For this purpose, we define the “fundamental groupoid” Π\(X\) of a space X to be the category whose objects are the points of X and whose morphisms x −→ y are the equivalence classes of paths from x to y\. Thus the set of endomorphisms of the object x is exactly the fundamental group π1 \(X, x\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=23" target="_blank">J. Peter May 23</a>)
- The term “groupoid” is used for a category all morphisms of which are isomorphisms\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=23" target="_blank">J. Peter May 23</a>)
- There is a useful notion of a skeleton skC of a category C \. This is a “full” subcategory with one object from each isomorphism class of objects of C , “full” meaning that the morphisms between two objects of skC are all of the morphisms between these objects in C \. The inclusion functor J : skC −→ C is an equivalence of categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=23" target="_blank">J. Peter May 23</a>)
- Let D be a small category and let C be any category\. A D-shaped diagram in C is a functor F : D −→ C \. A morphism F −→ F ′ of D-shaped diagrams is a natural transformation, and we have the category D[C ] of D-shaped diagrams in C (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">J. Peter May 24</a>)
- The colimit, colim F , of a D-shaped diagram F is an object of C together with a morphism of diagrams ι : F −→ colim F that is initial among all such morphisms\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">J. Peter May 24</a>)
- This means that if η : F −→ A is a morphism of diagrams, then there is a unique map η̃ : colim F −→ A in C such that η̃ ◦ ι = η\. Diagrammatically, this property is expressed by the assertion that, for each map d : D −→ D′ in D, we have a commutative diagram F (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">J. Peter May 24</a>)
- The limit of F is defined by reversing arrows: it is an object lim F of C together with a morphism of diagrams π : lim F −→ F that is terminal among all such morphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">J. Peter May 24</a>)
- If D is a set regarded as a discrete category \(only identity morphisms\), then colimits and limits indexed on D are coproducts and products indexed on the set D\. Coproducts are disjoint unions in S or U , wedges \(or one-point unions\) in T , free products in G , and direct sums in A b\. Products are Cartesian products in all of these categories; more precisely, they are Cartesian products of underlying sets, with additional structure\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">J. Peter May 24</a>)
- If D is the category displayed schematically as eo /f or // d′ , d d where we have displayed all objects and all non-identity morphisms, then the colimits indexed on D are called pushouts or coequalizers, respectively\. Similarly, if D is displayed schematically as e /do f or // d′ , d (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">J. Peter May 24</a>)
- then the limits indexed on D are called pullbacks or equalizers, respectively (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">J. Peter May 25</a>)
- A category is said to be cocomplete if it has all colimits, complete if it has all limits\. The categories S , U , T , G , and A b are complete and cocomplete\. If a category has coproducts and coequalizers, then it is cocomplete, and similarly for completeness\. The proof is a worthwhile exercise\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">J. Peter May 25</a>)
- The proof well illustrates how to manipulate colimits formally\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">J. Peter May 25</a>)
- Any compact surface is homeomorphic to a sphere, or to a connected sum of tori T 2 = S 1 × S 1 , or to a connected sum of projective planes RP 2 = S 2 /Z2 \(where we write Z2 = Z/2Z\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">J. Peter May 28</a>)
- Lemma\. For based spaces X and Y , π1 \(X × Y \) ∼ = ∼ = π1 \(X\) × π1 \(Y \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">J. Peter May 28</a>)
- Proposition\. Let X = U ∪V , where U , V , and U ∩V are path connected open neighborhoods of the basepoint of X and V is simply connected\. Then π1 \(U \) −→ π1 \(X\) is an epimorphism whose kernel is the smallest normal subgroup of π1 \(U \) that contains the image of π1 \(U ∩ V \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">J. Peter May 28</a>)
- We shall later use the following application of the van Kampen theorem to prove that any group is the fundamental group of some space\. We need a definition\. Definition\. A space X is said to be simply connected if it is path connected and satisfies π1 \(X\) = 0\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">J. Peter May 28</a>)
- However, I know of no published source for the use that we shall make of the orbit category O\(π1 \(B, b\)\) in the classification of coverings of a space B (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">J. Peter May 29</a>)
- This point of view gives us the opportunity to introduce some ideas that are central to equivariant algebraic topology, the study of spaces with group actions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">J. Peter May 29</a>)
- While the reader is free to think about locally contractible spaces, weaker conditions are appropriate for the full generality of the theory of covering spaces\. A space X is said to be locally path connected if for any x ∈ X and any neighborhood U of x, there is a smaller neighborhood V of x each of whose points can be connected to x by a path in U \. This is equivalent to the seemingly more stringent requirement that the topology of X have a basis consisting of path connected open sets\. In fact, if X is locally path connected and U is an open neighborhood of a point x, then the set V = {y | y can be connected to x by a path in U } is a path connected open neighborhood of x that is contained in U (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">J. Peter May 29</a>)
- Observe that if X is connected and locally path connected, then it is path connected (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">J. Peter May 29</a>)
- Definition\. A map p : E −→ B is a covering \(or cover, or covering space\) if it is surjective and if each point b ∈ B has an open neighborhood V such that each component of p−1 \(V \) is open in E and is mapped homeomorphically onto V by p (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Any homeomorphism is a cover\. A product of covers is a cover\. The projection R −→ S 1 is a cover (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Definition\. A covering p : E −→ B is regular if p∗ \(π1 \(E, e\)\) is a normal subgroup of π1 \(B, b\)\. It is universal if E is simply connected (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">J. Peter May 30</a>)
- As we shall explain in §4, for a universal cover p : E −→ B, the elements of Fb are in bijective correspondence with the elements of π1 \(B, b\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Example\. For n ≥ 2, S n is a universal cover of RP n \. Therefore π1 \(RP n \) has only two elements\. There is a unique group with two elements, and this proves our earlier claim that π1 \(RP n \) = Z2 \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- As e′ runs through Fb , the groups p∗ \(π1 \(E, e′ \)\) run through all conjugates of p∗ \(π1 \(E, e\)\) in π1 \(B, b\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Again, while it suffices to think in terms of locally contractible spaces, appropriate generality demands a weaker hypothesis\. We say that a space B is semi-locally simply connected if every point b ∈ B has a neighborhood U such that π1 \(U, b\) −→ π1 \(B, b\) is the trivial homomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- We shall often consider pairs \(X, A\) consisting of a space X and a subspace A\. Cofibration pairs will be those pairs that “behave homologically” just like the associated quotient spaces X/A\.

- Definition\. A pair \(X, A\) is an NDR-pair \(= neighborhood deformation retract pair\) if there is a map u : X −→ I such that u−1 \(0\) = A and a homotopy h : X × I −→ X such that h0 = id, h\(a, t\) = a for a ∈ A and t ∈ I, and h\(x, 1\) ∈ A if u\(x\) < 1; \(X, A\) is a DR-pair if u\(x\) < 1 for all x ∈ X, in which case A is a deformation retract of X\.

- Theorem\. Let A be a closed subspace of X\. Then the following are equivalent: \(i\) \(X, A\) is an NDR-pair\. \(ii\) \(X × I, X × {0} ∪ A × I\) is a DR-pair\. \(iii\) X × {0} ∪ A × I is a retract of X × I\. \(iv\) The inclusion i : A −→ X is a cofibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- It is often important to work in the category of spaces under a given space A, and we shall later need a basic result about homotopy equivalences in this category\. We shall also need a generalization concerning homotopy equivalences of pairs\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">J. Peter May 54</a>)
- A homotopy between maps under A is a homotopy that at each time t is a map under A\. We then write h : f ≃ f ′ rel A (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">J. Peter May 54</a>)
- A\. Such an equivalence is called a “cofiber homotopy equivalence\.” The name is suggested by the following result, whose proof illustrates a more substantial use of the HEP than we have seen before (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">J. Peter May 54</a>)
- Proposition\. Let i : A −→ X and j : A −→ Y be cofibrations and let f : X −→ Y be a map such that f ◦i = j\. Suppose that f is a homotopy equivalence\. Then f is a cofiber homotopy equivalence\.

- Definition\. A surjective map p : E −→ B is a fibration if it satisfies the covering homotopy property \(CHP\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">J. Peter May 57</a>)
- This notion of a fibration is due to Hurewicz\. There is a more general notion of a Serre fibration, in which the test spaces Y are restricted to be cubes I n \. Serre fibrations are more appropriate for many purposes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">J. Peter May 57</a>)
- With this formulation, we can “dualize” the proof that pushouts of cofibrations are cofibrations to show that pullbacks of fibrations are fibrations\. We often write A ×g E for the pullback of a given fibration p : E −→ B and a map g : A −→ B\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">J. Peter May 57</a>)
- Lemma\. If p : E −→ B is a fibration and g : A −→ B is any map, then the induced map A ×g E −→ A is a fibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">J. Peter May 57</a>)
- Although the CHP is expressed in terms of general test diagrams, there is a certain universal test diagram\. Namely, we can let Y in our original test diagram be the “mapping path space” N p ≡ E ×p B I = {\(e, β\)|β\(0\) = p\(e\)} ⊂ E × B I \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Lemma\. If i : A −→ X is a cofibration and B is a space, then the induced map p = B i : B X −→ B A is a fibration\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- When restricted to the spaces U in a well chosen open cover O of the base space B, a covering is homeomorphic to the projection U × F −→ U , where F is a fixed discrete set (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">J. Peter May 59</a>)
- The obvious generalization of this is the notion of a bundle\. A map p : E −→ B is a bundle if, when restricted to the spaces U in a well chosen open cover O of B, there are homeomorphisms φ : U × F −→ p−1 \(U \) such that p ◦ φ = π1 , where F is a fixed topological space\.

- A homotopy between maps over B is a homotopy that at each time t is a map over B\. There results a notion of a homotopy equivalence over B\. Such an equivalence is called a “fiber homotopy equivalence\.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Proposition\. Let p : D −→ B and q : E −→ B be fibrations and let f : D −→ E be a map such that q ◦ f = p\. Suppose that f is a homotopy equivalence\. Then f is a fiber homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

- Translation of fibers along paths in the base space played a fundamental role in our study of covering spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=61" target="_blank">J. Peter May 61</a>)
- Theorem\. Lifting of equivalence classes of paths in B to homotopy classes of maps of fibers specifies a functor λ : Π\(B\) −→ hU \. Therefore, if B is path connected, then any two fibers of B are homotopy equivalent\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=62" target="_blank">J. Peter May 62</a>)
- Just as the fundamental group π1 \(B, b\) of the base space of a covering acts on the fiber Fb , so the fundamental group π1 \(B, b\) of the base space of a fibration acts “up to homotopy” on the fiber (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=62" target="_blank">J. Peter May 62</a>)
- The composite of homotopy equivalences is a homotopy equivalence, and composition defines a continuous product on Aut\(X\)\. With this product, Aut\(X\) is a “topological monoid,” namely a space with a continuous and associative multiplication with a two-sided identity element, but it is not a group\. However, the path components of Aut\(X\) are the homotopy classes of homotopy equivalences of X, and these do form a group under composition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- For based spaces X and Y , we let [X, Y ] denote the set of based homotopy classes of based maps X −→ Y \. This set has a natural basepoint, namely the homotopy class of the constant map from X to the basepoint of Y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">J. Peter May 65</a>)
- The appropriate analogue of the Cartesian product in the category of based spaces is the “smash product” X ∧ Y defined by X ∧ Y = X × Y /X ∨ Y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">J. Peter May 65</a>)

- We view S 1 as I/∂I, denote its basepoint by 1, and define the suspension of X to be ΣX = X ∧ S 1 \. That is, ΣX = X × S 1 /\({∗} × S 1 ∪ X × {1}\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">J. Peter May 65</a>)
- These are sometimes called the reduced cone and suspension, to distinguish them from the unreduced constructions, in which the line {∗} × I through the basepoint of X is not identified to a point (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">J. Peter May 65</a>)
- Dually, we define the path space of X to be P X = F \(I, X\), where I is given the basepoint 0\. Thus the points of P X are the paths in X that start at the basepoint\. We define the loop space of X to be ΩX = F \(S 1 , X\)\. Its points are the loops at the basepoint\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- The space X ∧ I+ is called the reduced cylinder on X, and a based homotopy X × I −→ Y is the same thing as a based map X ∧ I+ −→ Y \.

- We introduce a large class of spaces, called CW complexes, between which a weak equivalence is necessarily a homotopy equivalence\. Thus, for such spaces, the homotopy groups are, in a sense, a complete set of invariants\. Moreover, we shall see that every space is weakly equivalent to a CW complex (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Lemma\. If A is a subcomplex of a CW complex X, Y is a CW complex, and f : A −→ Y is a cellular map, then the pushout Y ∪f X is a CW complex that contains Y as a subcomplex and has one cell for each cell of X that is not in A\.

- If X is a finite CW complex, in the sense that it has finitely many cells, and if dim X > 1 and X is not contractible, then it is known that X has infinitely many non-zero homotopy groups\. The Whitehead theorem is thus surprisingly strong: in its first statement, if low dimensional homotopy groups are mapped isomorphically, then so are all higher homotopy groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- The fundamental obstruction to the calculation of homotopy groups is the failure of excision: for an excisive triad \(X; A, B\), the inclusion \(A, A ∩ B\) −→ \(X, B\) fails to induce an isomorphism of homotopy groups in general (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=91" target="_blank">J. Peter May 91</a>)

- Theorem\. Let f : X −→ Y be an \(n−1\)-equivalence between \(n−2\)-connected spaces, where n ≥ 2; thus πn−1 \(f \) is an epimorphism\. Then the quotient map π : \(M f, X\) −→ \(Cf, ∗\) is a \(2n − 2\)-equivalence\. In particular, Cf is \(n − 1\)connected\. If X and Y are \(n − 1\)-connected, then π : \(M f, X\) −→ \(Cf, ∗\) is a \(2n − 1\)-equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Then Cf is \(n − 1\)-connected and πn \(M f, X\) −→ πn \(Cf, ∗\) is an isomorphism\. Moreover, the canonical map η : F f −→ ΩCf induces an isomorphism πn−1 \(F f \) −→ πn \(Cf \)\.

- Theorem\. Let i : A −→ X be a cofibration and an \(n − 1\)-equivalence between \(n − 2\)-connected spaces, where n ≥ 2\.

- A specialization of the last result gives the Freudenthal suspension theorem\. For a based space X, define the suspension homomorphism Σ : πq \(X\) −→ πq+1 \(ΣX\) by letting Σf = f ∧ id : S q+1 ∼ = ∼ = S q ∧ S 1 −→ X ∧ S 1 = ΣX\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- We saw by use of the Hopf bundle S 3 −→ S 2 that π2 \(S 2 \) = Z, and the suspension theorem applies to give the conclusion for n ≥ 2\. A little extra argument is needed to check that Σ is an isomorphism for n = 1; one can inspect the connecting homomorphism of the Hopf bundle or refer ahead to the observation that the Hurewicz homomorphism commutes with the corresponding suspension isomorphism in homology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- The dimensional range of the suspension theorem is sharp\. We saw before that π3 \(S 2 \) = π3 \(S 3 \), which is Z\. The suspension theorem applies to show that Σ : π3 \(S 2 \) −→ π4 \(S 3 \) is an epimorphism, and it is known that π4 \(S 3 \) = Z2 \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- The calculation of the stable homotopy groups of spheres, πqs qs \(S 0 \), is one of the deepest and most studied problems in algebraic topology\.

- Unlike homotopy groups, these are stable invariants, the same for a space and its suspension, and it is this that makes them computable\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Clearly, up to canonical isomorphism, this construction of a homology theory on pairs of spaces is independent of the choice of our CW approximation functor Γ\. The reader may have seen singular homology before\. As we shall explain later, the classical construction of singular homology amounts to a choice of a particularly nice CW approximation functor, one that is actually functorial on the point-set level, before passage to homotopy categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Let X be a CW complex\. We shall define the cellular chain complex C∗ \(X\)\. We let Cn \(X\) be the free Abelian group with one generator [j] for each n-cell j\. We must define a differential dn : Cn \(X\) −→ Cn−1 \(X\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- It will be convenient to work with unreduced cones, cofibers, and suspensions in this section; that is, we do not choose basepoints and so we do not collapse out lines through basepoints (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=105" target="_blank">J. Peter May 105</a>)
- We still have the basic result that if i : A −→ X is a cofibration, then collapsing the cone on A to a point gives a homotopy equivalence ψ : Ci −→ X/A\.

- Our first definition of dn involves the calculation of the degrees of maps between spheres (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=105" target="_blank">J. Peter May 105</a>)
- However, there are three models of S n that are needed in our discussion: the standard sphere S n ⊂ Dn+1 , the quotient Dn /S n−1 , and the \(unreduced\) suspension ΣS n−1 \. We must fix suitably compatible homeomorphisms relating these “n-spheres\.” We define a homeomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- We have dealt so far with the case of integral homology\. For more general coefficient groups π, we define C∗ \(X, A; π\) = C∗ \(X, A\) ⊗ π (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Cellular chains make some computations quite trivial\. For example, since S n is a CW complex with one vertex and one n-cell, we see immediately that ̃ H̃n \(S n ; π\) ∼ = ∼ =π and ̃ H̃q \(S n ; π\) = 0 for q 6= n\.

- if we look back at the CW decompositions of the torus T , the projective plane RP 2 , and the Klein bottle K and if we let j denote the unique 2-cell in each case, then we find the following descriptions of the cellular chains and integral homologies by quick direct inspections (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- While homology groups are far easier to compute than homotopy groups, direct chain level calculation is seldom the method of choice\. Rather, one uses chains as a tool for developing more sophisticated algebraic techniques, notably spectral sequences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=112" target="_blank">J. Peter May 112</a>)
- We give an illustration that both shows that chain level calculations are sometimes practicable even when there are many non-zero differentials to determine and indicates why one might not wish to attempt such calculations for really complicated spaces\.

- A “generalized homology theory” E∗ is defined to be a system of functors Eq \(X, A\) and natural transformations ∂ : Eq \(X, A\) −→ Eq−1 \(A\) that satisfy all of our axioms except for the dimension axiom\.

- following our proposal that E∗ \(X, A\) be taken as an alternative notation for H∗ \(X, A; π\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=115" target="_blank">J. Peter May 115</a>)
- One of the themes of this chapter is the relationship between homology theories on pairs of spaces and reduced homology theories on based spaces\. The latter are more convenient in most advanced work in algebraic topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=115" target="_blank">J. Peter May 115</a>)
- For a based space X, we define the reduced homology of X to be ̃ Ẽq \(X\) = Eq \(X, ∗\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=115" target="_blank">J. Peter May 115</a>)
- Since the basepoint is a retract of X, there results a direct sum decomposition E∗ \(X\) ∼ = ∼ = E ̃ Ẽ∗ \(X\) ⊕ E∗ \(∗\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=115" target="_blank">J. Peter May 115</a>)
- the exactness axiom implies that there is a reduced long exact sequence · · · −→ E ̃ Ẽq \(A\) −→ E ̃ Ẽq \(X\) −→ Eq \(X, A\) ∂ ∂ − → E ̃ Ẽq−1 \(A\) −→ · · · \.

Peter May 115</a>)
- We can obtain the unreduced homology groups as special cases of the reduced ones\. For an unbased space X, we define a based space X+ by adjoining a disjoint basepoint to X\. By the additivity axiom, we see immediately that E∗ \(X\) = E ̃ Ẽ∗ \(X+ \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=115" target="_blank">J. Peter May 115</a>)
- In fact, the unreduced cone on a space Y coincides with the reduced cone on Y+ : the line through the disjoint basepoint is identified to the cone point when constructing the reduced cone on Y+ \. Therefore the unreduced cofiber of an unbased map f coincides with the reduced cofiber of the based map f+ \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=116" target="_blank">J. Peter May 116</a>)
- The observant reader will have noticed that the unreduced suspension of X is not the reduced suspension on X+ \. Rather, under either interpretation of suspension, Σ\(X+ \) is homotopy equivalent to the wedge of Σ\(X\) and a circle\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- a special case of the reduced homology of spaces\. Theorem\. For any cofibration i : A −→ X, the quotient map q : \(X, A\) −→ \(X/A, ∗\) induces an isomorphism E∗ \(X, A\) −→ E∗ \(X/A, ∗\) = E ̃ Ẽ∗ \(X/A\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Recall that a basepoint ∗ ∈ X is nondegenerate if the inclusion {∗} −→ X is a cofibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=117" target="_blank">J. Peter May 117</a>)
- This ensures that the inclusion of the line through the basepoint in the unreduced suspension of X is a cofibration, so that the map from the unreduced suspension to the suspension that collapses out the line through the basepoint is a homotopy equivalence\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=117" target="_blank">J.

- Theorem\. For a nondegenerately based space X, there is a natural isomorphism Σ : E ̃ Ẽq \(X\) ∼ = ∼ = E ̃ Ẽq+1 \(ΣX\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- In the study of generalized homology theories, it is most convenient to restrict attention to reduced homology theories defined on nondegenerately based spaces\.

- Definition\. A reduced homology theory ̃ Ẽ∗ consists of functors ̃ Ẽq from the homotopy category of nondegenerately based spaces to the category of Abelian groups that satisfy the following axioms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=118" target="_blank">J. Peter May 118</a>)
- For the additivity axiom, we note that the cofiber of a disjoint union of maps is the wedge of the cofibers of the given maps (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- The first is the long exact sequence of a triple \(X, A, B\) of spaces B ⊂ A ⊂ X, which is just like its analogue for homotopy groups\. Proposition\. For a triple \(X, A, B\), the following sequence is exact: · · · −→ Eq \(A, B\) i i −→∗ Eq \(X, B\) j j∗ −→ Eq \(X, A\) ∂ ∂ − → Eq−1 \(A, B\) −→ · · · \. Here i : \(A, B\) −→ \(X, B\) and j : \(X, B\) −→ \(X, A\) are inclusions and ∂ is the composite Eq \(X, A\) ∂ ∂ − → Eq−1 \(A\) −→ Eq−1 \(A, B\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=120" target="_blank">J. Peter May 120</a>)
- Theorem \(Mayer-Vietoris sequence\)\. Let \(X; A, B\) be an excisive triad and set C = A ∩ B\. The following sequence is exact: · · · −→ Eq \(C\) ψ − → Eq \(A\) ⊕ Eq \(B\) φ − → Eq \(X\) ∆ ∆ −→ Eq−1 \(C\) −→ · · · \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=120" target="_blank">J. Peter May 120</a>)
- Alternatively, one can use CW approximation\. For a CW triad, there is a short exact sequence 0 −→ C∗ \(C\) −→ C∗ \(A\) ⊕ C∗ \(B\) −→ C∗ \(X\) −→ 0 whose associated long exact sequence is the Mayer-Vietoris sequence\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=121" target="_blank">J.

- We have seen that the compactness of spheres S n and cylinders S n × I implies that, for any choice of basepoint in X0 , the natural map colim π∗ \(Xi \) −→ π∗ \(X\) is an isomorphism\. We shall use the additivity and weak equivalence axioms and the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to prove the analogue for homology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=122" target="_blank">J. Peter May 122</a>)
- We record an algebraic description of the colimit of a sequence for use in the proof\. Lemma\. Let fi : Ai −→ Ai+1 be a sequence of homomorphisms of Abelian groups\. Then there is a short exact sequence s a short 0 −→ i Ai ct seq − → i Ai β − → colim Ai −→ 0, where α\(ai \) = ai − fi \(ai \) for ai ∈ Ai and the restriction of β to Ai is the canonical map given by the definition of a colimit (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- The proof makes use of a useful general construction called the “telescope” of the Xi , denoted tel Xi (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Inductively, let Y0 = X0 × {0} and suppose that we have constructed Yi ⊃ Xi × {i}\. Define Yi+1 to be the double mapping cylinder Yi ∪ Mi+1 obtained by identifying \(x, i\) ∈ Yi with \(x, i\) ∈ Mi+1 for x ∈ Xi \. Define tel Xi to be the union of the Yi , with the colimit topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Remark\. There is a general theory of “homotopy colimits,” which are up to homotopy versions of colimits\. The telescope is the homotopy colimit of a sequence\. The double mapping cylinder that we used in approximating excisive triads by CW triads is the homotopy pushout of a diagram of the shape • ←− • −→ •\. We implicitly used homotopy coequalizers in constructing CW approximations of spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Theorem \(Hurewicz\)\. Let X be any \(n − 1\)-connected based space\. Then h : πn \(X\) −→ H ̃ H̃n \(X\) is the Abelianization homomorphism if n = 1 and is an isomorphism if n > 1\.

- Here the groups on the left are defined in terms of homotopy groups and were used in our construction of cellular chains, while the groups on the right are those of our given homology theory\. We use the groups on the right to construct cellular chains in our given theory, and we find that the isomorphism is compatible with differentials (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Thus let X be a CW complex\. For each integer n, define Cn \(X\) = Hn \(X n , X n−1 \) ∼ = ∼ = H ̃ H̃n \(X n /X n−1 \)\. Define d : Cn \(X\) −→ Cn−1 \(X\) to be the composite Hn \(X n , X n−1 \) ∂ ∂ − → Hn−1 \(X n−1 \) −→ Hn−1 \(X n−1 , X n−2 \)\. It is not hard to check that d ◦ d = 0\.

- Theorem\. There is a natural isomorphism H∗ \(X, A\) ∼ = ∼ = H∗ \(C∗ \(X, A\)\) under which the natural transformation ∂ agrees with the natural transformation induced by the connecting homomorphisms associated to the short exact sequences 0 −→ C∗ \(A\) −→ C∗ \(X\) −→ C∗ \(X, A\) −→ 0\.

- The singular homology of X is usually defined in terms of this chain complex: H∗ \(X; π\) = H∗ \(C∗ \(X\) ⊗ π\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=132" target="_blank">J. Peter May 132</a>)
- We define a space ΓX, called the “geometric realization of the total singular complex of X,” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=132" target="_blank">J. Peter May 132</a>)
- We may define the geometric realization |K∗ | of general simplicial sets exactly as we defined the geometric realization ΓX = |S∗ X| of the total singular complex of a topological space\. In fact, the total singular complex and geometric realization functors are adjoint (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=134" target="_blank">J. Peter May 134</a>)
- One can define a simplicial object in any category C as a sequence of objects Kn of C connected by face and degeneracy maps in C that satisfy the commutation relations that we have displayed\. Thus we have simplicial groups, simplicial Abelian groups, simplicial spaces, and so forth\. We can think of simplicial sets as discrete simplicial spaces, and we then see that geometric realization generalizes directly to a functor | − | from the category S U of simplicial spaces to the category U of spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">J. Peter May 135</a>)
- We note one of the principal features of geometric realization (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">J. Peter May 135</a>)
- The projections induce maps of simplicial spaces from X∗ × Y∗ to X∗ and Y∗ \. On passage to geometric realization, these give the coordinates of a map |X∗ × Y∗ | −→ |X∗ | × |Y∗ |\. It turns out that this map is always a homeomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">J. Peter May 135</a>)
- Now restrict attention to simplicial sets K∗ and L∗ \. Then the homeomorphism just specified is a map between CW complexes\. However, it is not a cellular map; rather, it takes the n-skeleton of |K∗ × L∗ | to the 2n-skeleton of |K∗ | × |L∗ |\. It is homotopic to a cellular map, no longer a homeomorphism, and there results a chain homotopy equivalence C∗ \(|K∗ × L∗ |\) −→ C∗ \(|K∗ |\) ⊗ C∗ \(|L∗ |\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">J. Peter May 135</a>)
- In particular, for spaces X and Y , there is a natural chain homotopy equivalence from the singular chain complex C∗ \(X × Y \) to the tensor product C∗ \(X\) ⊗ C∗ \(Y \)\.

- It is less intuitive, but true, that the space E\(G\) is contractible\. By the long exact homotopy sequence, these facts imply that πq+1 \(BG\) ∼ = ∼ = πq \(G\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=136" target="_blank">J. Peter May 136</a>)

- This allows us to iterate the construction, setting B 0 \(G\) = G and B n \(G\) = B\(B n−1 \(G\)\) for n ≥ 1\. Specializing to a discrete Abelian group π, we define K\(π, n\) = B n \(π\)\.

- It can be computed by constructing a short exact sequence 0 −→ F1 −→ F0 −→ M −→ 0 and tensoring with N to obtain an exact seqence 0 −→ Tor R 1 \(M, N \) −→ F1 ⊗ N −→ F0 ⊗ N −→ M ⊗ N −→ 0, where F1 and F0 are free R-modules\.

- \. We assume that the reader has seen Ext modules, which measure the failure of Hom to be an exact functor\. For a PID R, the only Ext module is the first one, denoted Ext1 R R \(M, N \)\. It can be computed by constructing a short exact sequence 0 −→ F1 −→ F0 −→ M −→ 0 and applying Hom to obtain an exact seqence 0 −→ Hom\(M, N \) −→ Hom\(F0 , N \) −→ Hom\(F1 , N \) −→ Ext1 R R \(M, N \) −→ 0, where F1 and F0 are free R-modules (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Second, when R is a PID, a short exact sequence 0 −→ L ′ −→ L −→ L ′′ −→ 0 of R-modules gives rise to a six-term exact sequence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=144" target="_blank">J. Peter May 144</a>)
- We also have a natural homomorphism Hom\(L, M \) ⊗ N −→ Hom\(L, M ⊗ N \), and this is an isomorphism if either L or N is a finitely generated projective Rmodule (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=144" target="_blank">J. Peter May 144</a>)
- Again, we have a natural map Hom\(L, M \) ⊗ Hom\(L ′ , M ′ \) −→ Hom\(L ⊗ L ′ , M ⊗ M ′ \), which is an isomorphism if L and L′ are finitely generated and projective or if L is finitely generated and projective and M = R\.

- For its flatness hypothesis, it is useful to remember that, for any Noetherian ring R, the dual Hom\(F, R\) of a free R-module is a flat R-module (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- The essential new feature is the cup product structure that makes the cohomology of X with coefficients in a commutative ring R a commutative graded R-algebra\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=145" target="_blank">J.

- For general spaces X, we can use ΓX = |S∗ X| as a canonical CW approximation functor (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=146" target="_blank">J. Peter May 146</a>)
- By our observations about cochain complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=147" target="_blank">J. Peter May 147</a>)
- This product makes H ∗ \(X; R\) into a graded unital, associative, and “commutative” R-algebra\. Here commutativity is understood in the appropriate graded sense (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=147" target="_blank">J. Peter May 147</a>)
- In both diagrams, τ \(x ⊗ y\) = \(−1\) pq y ⊗ x if deg x = p and deg y = q\. The reason is that, on the topological level, t permutes p-cells past q-cells and, on the level of cellular chains, this involves the transposition S p+q = S p ∧ S q −→ S q ∧ S p = S p+q \. We leave it as an exercise that this map has degree \(−1\)pq \. It is this fact that forces the cup product to be commutative in the graded sense (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=148" target="_blank">J. Peter May 148</a>)
- In principle, the way to compute cup products is to pass to cellular chains from a cellular approximation to the diagonal map ∆\. The point is that ∆ fails to be cellular since it carries the n-skeleton of X to the 2n-skeleton of X × X\. In practice, this does not work very well and more indirect means of computation must be used\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- 4\. An example: RP n and the Borsuk-Ulam theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=148" target="_blank">J. Peter May 148</a>)
- We shall later use Poincaré duality to give a quick proof that the cohomology algebra H ∗ \(RP n ; Z2 \) is a truncated polynomial algebra Z2 [x]/\(xn+1 \), where deg x = 1\.

Peter May 148</a>)
- We use this fact together with covering space theory to prove a celebrated result known as the Borsuk-Ulam theorem\. A map g : S m −→ S n is said to be antipodal if it takes pairs of antipodal points to pairs of antipodal points\. It then induces a map f : RP m −→ RP n such that the following diagram commutes: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=149" target="_blank">J. Peter May 149</a>)
- Theorem\. If m > n ≥ 1, then there exist no antipodal maps S m −→ S n \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=149" target="_blank">J. Peter May 149</a>)
- Theorem \(Borsuk-Ulam\)\. For any continuous map f : S n −→ Rn , there exists x ∈ S n such that f \(x\) = f \(−x\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Proof\. Suppose for a contradiction that f \(x\) 6= f \(−x\) for all x\. We could then define a continuous antipodal map g : S n −→ S n−1 by letting g\(x\) be the point at which the vector from 0 through f \(x\) − f \(−x\) intersects S n−1 \.

- We give an outline of one of the most striking features of cohomology: the cohomology groups of a space X with coefficients in the homotopy groups of a space Y control the construction of homotopy classes of maps X −→ Y \. As a matter of motivation, this helps explain why one is interested in general coefficient groups\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Definition\. Fix n ≥ 1\. A connected space X is said to be n-simple if π1 \(X\) is Abelian and acts trivially on the homotopy groups πq \(X\) for q ≤ n; X is said to be simple if it is n-simple for all n\.

- If we compose the attaching maps S n → X of cells of X \ A with f , we obtain elements of πn \(Y \)\. These elements specify a well defined “obstruction cocycle” cf ∈ C n+1 \(X, A; πn \(Y \)\)\.

- Clearly, by considering extensions cell by cell, f extends to X n+1 if and only if cf = 0 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- considering extensions cell by cell, f extends to X n+1 if and only if cf = 0\. This is not a computable criterion\.

- We shall use the additivity and weak equivalence axioms and the MayerVietoris sequence to explain how to compute E ∗ \(X\)\. The answer is more subtle than in homology because, algebraically, limits are less well behaved than colimits: they are not exact functors from diagrams of Abelian groups to Abelian groups\.

- That is, we may as well define lim 1 Ai to be the displayed cokernel\. We then have the following result\. Theorem\. For each q, there is a natural short exact sequence 0 −→ lim 1 E q−1 \(Xi \) −→ E q \(X\) π π − → lim E q \(Xi \) −→ 0, where π is induced by the inclusions Xi −→ X\.

- We say that an inverse sequence fi : Ai+1 −→ Ai satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition if, for each fixed i, there exists j ≥ i such that, for every k > j, the image of the composite Ak −→ Ai is equal to the image of the composite Aj −→ Ai \. For example, this holds if all but finitely many of the fi are epimorphisms or if the Ai are all finite\. As a matter of algebra, we have the following vanishing result\. Lemma\. If the inverse sequence fi : Ai+1 −→ Ai satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition, then lim 1 Ai = 0\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- If we assume given a theory that satisfies the axioms, we see that the cochains with coefficients in π of a CW complex X can be redefined by C n \(X; π\) = H n \(X n , X n−1 ; π\), with differential d : C n \(X; π\) −→ C n+1 \(X; π\) the composite H n \(X n , X n−1 ; π\) −→ H n \(X n \) δ δ − → H n+1 \(X n+1 , X n \)\. That is, the following result holds\. Theorem\. C ∗ \(X; π\) as just defined is isomorphic to Hom\(C∗ \(X\), π\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Cup products are “unstable,” in the sense that they vanish on suspensions\. This is an indication of how much more information they carry than the mere additive groups\. The proof given by this sequence of exercises actually applies to any “multiplicative” cohomology theory, that is, any theory that has suitable cup products (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- It is apparent that there is a kind of duality relating the construction of homology and cohomology\. In its simplest form, this is reflected by the fact that evaluation of cochains on chains gives a natural homomorphism C p \(X; π\) ⊗ Cp \(X; ρ\) −→ π ⊗ ρ\. This passes to homology and cohomology to give an evaluation pairing H p \(X; π\) ⊗ Hp \(X; ρ\) −→ π ⊗ ρ\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- We shall study manifolds without boundary in this chapter, turning to manifolds with boundary in the next\. We do not assume that M is differentiable\. It is known that M can be given the structure of a finite CW complex, and its homology and cohomology groups are therefore finitely generated\. When M is differentiable, it is not hard to prove this using Morse theory, but it is a deep theorem in the general topological case (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- If R is a field and M is “R-orientable,” then there is an “R-fundamental class” z ∈ Hn \(M ; R\)\. The composite of the cup product and evaluation on z gives a cup product pairing H p \(M ; R\) ⊗ H n−p \(M ; R\) −→ R\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- One version of the Poincaré duality theorem asserts that this pairing is nonsingular, so that its adjoint is an isomorphism H p \(M ; R\) = ∼ = HomR \(H ∼ n−p \(M ; R\), R\) ∼ = ∼ = Hn−p \(M ; R\)\.

- Corollary\. As a graded ring, H ∗ \(CP n \) is the truncated polynomial algebra Z[α]/\(αn+1 \), where deg α = 2\. That is, H 2q \(CP n \) is the free Abelian group with generator αq for 1 ≤ q ≤ n\.

- a field\. Then α ⊗ β −→ hα ∪ β, zi defines a nonsingular pairing H p \(M ; R\) ⊗R H n−p \(M ; R\) −→ R\. We shall see that every manifold is Z2 -oriented, and an argument exactly like that for CP n allows us to compute the cup products in H ∗ \(RP n ; Z2 \)\. We used this information in our proof of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Corollary\. As a graded ring, H ∗ \(RP n ; Z2 \) is the truncated polynomial algebra Z2 [α]/\(α n+1 \), where deg α = 1\. That is, α q is the non-zero element of H q \(RP n ; Z2 \) for 1 ≤ q ≤ n\.

- Using the evident natural map from the tensor product of homologies to the homology of a tensor product, we see that ∩ passes to homology to induce a pairing ∩ : H ∗ \(X; π\) ⊗R H∗ \(X; R\) −→ H∗ \(X; π\)\.

- For use in the proof of the Poincaré duality theorem, we observe that the cap product generalizes to relative cap products (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- We think of Hn \(M, M − x\) as a free R-module on one generator, but the generator \(which corresponds to a unit of the ring R\) is unspecified\. Intuitively, an R-orientation of M is a consistent choice of generators\. Definition\. An R-fundamental class of M at a subspace X is an element z ∈ Hn \(M, M − X\) such that, for each x ∈ X, the image of z under the map Hn \(M, M − X\) −→ Hn \(M, M − x\) induced by the inclusion \(M, M − X\) −→ \(M, M − x\) is a generator\. If X = M , we refer to z ∈ Hn \(M \) as a fundamental class of M \. An R-orientation of M is an open cover {Ui } and R-fundamental classes zi of M at Ui such that if Ui ∩ Uj is non-empty, then zi and zj map to the same element of Hn \(M, M − Ui ∩ Uj \)\.

- We say that M is R-orientable if it admits an R-orientation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=164" target="_blank">J. Peter May 164</a>)
- Theorem \(Vanishing\)\. Let M be an n-manifold\. For any coefficient group π, Hi \(M ; π\) = 0 if i > n, and ̃ H̃n \(M ; π\) = 0 if M is connected and is not compact\.

- We can use this together with Mayer-Vietoris sequences to construct R-fundamental classes at compact subspaces from R-orientations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Theorem\. Let K be a compact subset of M \. Then, for any coefficient group π, Hi \(M, M − K; π\) = 0 if i > n, and an R-orientation of M determines an Rfundamental class of M at K\. In particular, if M is compact, then an R-orientation of M determines an R-fundamental class of M (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Corollary\. Let M be a connected compact n-manifold, n > 0\. Then either M is not orientable and Hn \(M ; Z\) = 0 or M is orientable and the map Hn \(M ; Z\) −→ Hn \(M, M − x; Z\) ∼ = ∼ =Z is an isomorphism for every x ∈ M \.

- As an aside, the corollary leads to a striking example of the failure of the naturality of the splitting in the universal coefficient theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Thus the left and right vertical arrows are zero\. If the splittings of the rows were natural, this would imply that the middle vertical arrow is also zero (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- We begin with the general observation that homology is “compactly supported” in the sense of the following result\. Lemma\. For any space X and element x ∈ Hq \(X\), there is a compact subspace K of X and an element k ∈ Hq \(K\) that maps to x\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Remember that homology is a covariant functor with compact supports\. Cohomology is a contravariant functor, and it does not have compact supports (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=168" target="_blank">J. Peter May 168</a>)
- We would like to prove the Poincaré duality theorem by inductive comparisons of Mayer-Vietoris sequences, and the opposite variance of homology and cohomology makes it unclear how to proceed\. To get around this, we introduce a variant of cohomology that does have compact supports and has enough covariant functoriality to allow us to proceed by comparisons of Mayer-Vietoris sequences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Consider the set K of compact subspaces K of M \. This set is directed under inclusion; to conform with our earlier discussion of colimits, we may view K as a category whose objects are the compact subspaces K and whose maps are the inclusions between them\. We define H q cq \(M \) = colim H q \(M, M − K\), where the colimit is taken with respect to the homomorphisms H q \(M, M − K\) −→ H q \(M, M − L\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- A map f : M −→ N is said to be proper if f −1 \(L\) is compact in M when L is compact in N \.

- Proposition\. Let M be a connected n-manifold\. Then there is a 2-fold cover p : ̃ M̃ −→ M such that ̃ M̃ is connected if and only if M is not orientable (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Corollary\. If M is simply connected, or if π1 \(M \) contains no subgroup of index 2, then M is orientable\. If M is orientable, then M admits exactly two orientations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=172" target="_blank">J. Peter May 172</a>)
- We can use homology with coefficients in a commutative ring R to construct an analogous R-orientation cover\. It depends on the units of R\. For example, if R = Z2 , then the R-orientation cover is the identity map of M since there is a unique unit in R\. This reproves the obvious fact that any manifold is Z2 oriented\. The evident ring homomorphism Z −→ R induces a natural homomorphism H∗ \(X; Z\) −→ H∗ \(X; R\), and we see immediately that an orientation of M induces an R-orientation of M for any R\.

- Moreover, there is a relative version of Poincaré duality in the context of manifolds with boundary, and this leads to necessary algebraic conditions on the cohomology of a manifold that must be satisfied if it is to be a boundary\.

- We may take F = Z2 , and so dispense with the requirement that M be oriented\. If n is odd, the summands of χ\(M \) cancel in pairs, and we obtain the following conclusion\. Proposition\.

- Let Hn = {\(x1 , \. \. \., xn \)|xn ≥ 0} be the upper half-plane in Rn \. Recall that an n-manifold with boundary is a Hausdorff space M having a countable basis of open sets such that every point of M has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of H n \. A point x is an interior point if it has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of Hn − ∂Hn ∼ = Rn ; otherwise it is a boundary point\. It is a fact called “invariance of domain” that if U and V are homeomorphic subspaces of Rn and U is open, then V is open\. Therefore, a homeomorphism of an open subspace of Hn onto an open subspace of Hn carries boundary points to boundary points\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Since n complex X to being a complete set of invariants for its homotopy K\(πn \(X\), n\) has the same homotopy groups as X but is generally not weakly homotopy equivalent to it, some added information is needed\.

- Since the normal bundle of the standard embedding S q −→ Rq+1 is trivial, w\(S q \) = 1\. A manifold is said to be parallelizable if its tangent bundle is trivial\. For some manifolds M , we can show that M is not parallelizable by showing that one of its Stiefel-Whitney classes is non-zero, but this strategy fails for M = S q \.

- For example, w\(RP q \) = 1 if and only if q = 2k − 1 for some k \(as the reader should check\) and therefore RP q can be parallelizable only if q is of this form (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- If R q+1 admits a bilinear product without zero divisors, then it is not hard to prove that τ \(RP q \) ∼ = ∼ = Hom\(ζq , ζ ⊥ q⊥ \) admits q linearly independent cross-sections and is therefore trivial\. We conclude that Rq+1 can admit such a product only if q+1 = 2k for some k\. The real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, and Cayley numbers show that there is such a product for q + 1 = 1, 2, 4, and 8\. As we shall explain in the next chapter, these are in fact the only q for which Rq+1 admits such a product (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- While the calculation of w\(RP q \) just given is quite special, there is a remarkable general recipe, called the “Wu formula,” for the computation of w\(M \) in terms of Poincaré duality and the Steenrod operations in H ∗ \(M ; Z2 \)\. In analogy with w\(M \), general recipe, called the “Wu formula,” for the computation of w\( Poincaré duality and the Steenrod operations in H ∗ \(M ; Z2 \)\. In anal we define the total Steenrod square of an element x by Sq\(x\) = i Sq i \(x\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Theorem \(Wu formula\)\. Let M be a smooth closed n-manifold with funda\(M ; Z2 \)\. Then the total Stiefel-Whitney class w\(M \) is equal Theorem \(Wu formula\)\. Let M be a smooth closed n-manifold with funda mental class z ∈ HnP \(M ; Z2 \)\. Then the total Stiefel-Whitney class w\(M \) is equ to Sq\(v\), where v = vi ∈ H ∗∗ \(M ; Z2 \) is the unique cohomology class such that hv ∪ x, zi = hSq\(x\), zi for all x ∈ H \(M ; Z2 \)\. Thus, for k ≥ 0, vk ∪ x = Sq k \(x\) for all x ∈ H n−k \(M ; Z2 \), ∗ and wk \(M \) = vk i+j=k Sq i \(vj \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=201" target="_blank">J. Peter May 201</a>)
- The basic reason that such a formula holds is that the StiefelWhitney classes can be defined in terms of the Steenrod operations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=201" target="_blank">J. Peter May 201</a>)
- Since the tangent bundle of M depends on its smooth structure, this is rather surprising (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=201" target="_blank">J. Peter May 201</a>)

- Definition\. Let M be a smooth closed R-oriented n-manifold with fundamental class z ∈ Hn \(M ; R\)\. For a characteristic class c of degree n, define the tangential characteristic number c[M ] ∈ R by c[M ] = hc\(τ \(M \)\), zi\. Similarly, define the normal characteristic number c[ν\(M \)] by c[ν\(M \)] = hc\(ν\(M \)\), zi, where ν\(M \) is the normal bundle associated to an embedding of M in Rq for q sufficiently large\. \(These numbers are well defined because any two embeddings of M in Rq for large q are isotopic and have equivalent normal bundles\.\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Theorem \(Thom\)\. If M is a smooth closed n-manifold all of whose normal Stiefel-Whitney numbers are zero, then M is the boundary of a smooth \(n + 1\)manifold\.

- Thus we need only compute the Stiefel-Whitney numbers of M to determine whether or not it is a boundary\. By Wu’s formula, the computation only requires knowledge of the mod 2 cohomology of M , with its Steenrod operations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)
- There are several ways to construct the Stiefel-Whitney classes\. The most illuminating one depends on a simple, but fundamentally important, construction on vector bundles, namely their “Thom spaces\.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)
- Definition\. Let ξ : E −→ B be an n-plane bundle\. Apply one-point compactification to each fiber of ξ to obtain a new bundle Sph\(E\) over B whose fibers are spheres S n with given basepoints, namely the points at ∞\. These basepoints specify a cross-section B −→ Sph\(E\)\. Define the Thom space T ξ to be the quotient space T \(ξ\) = Sph\(E\)/B\. That is, T \(ξ\) is obtained from E by applying fiberwise one-point compactification and then identifying all of the points at ∞ to a single basepoint \(denoted ∞\)\.

Peter May 202</a>)
- Remark\. If we give the bundle ξ a Euclidean metric and let D\(E\) and S\(E\) denote its unit disk bundle and unit sphere bundle, then there is an evident homeomorphism between T ξ and the quotient space D\(E\)/S\(E\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)
- In turn, D\(E\)/S\(E\) is homotopy equivalent to the cofiber of the inclusion S\(E\) −→ D\(E\) and therefore to the cofiber of the projection S\(E\) −→ B\.

- If the bundle ξ is trivial, so that E = B × Rn , then Sph\(E\) = B × S n \. Quotienting out B amounts to the same thing as giving B a disjoint basepoint and then forming the smash product B+ ∧ S n \. That is, in this case the Thom complex is Σn B+ \. Therefore, for any cohomology theory k ∗ , k q \(B\) = k̃ k̃ q \(B+ \) ∼ = ∼ = k̃ k̃ n+q \(T ξ\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- One advantage of this approach is that, since we know the Steenrod operations on H ∗ \(RP ∞ ; Z2 \) and can read them off on H ∗ \(\(RP ∞ \) n ; Z2 \) by the Cartan formula, it leads to a purely algebraic calculation of the Steenrod operations in H ∗ \(BO\(n\); Z2 \)\.

- The Thom space of a complex or oriented real vector bundle is the Thom space of its underlying real vector bundle\.

- The reader deserves to be warned about a basic inconsistency in the literature\. Remark\. With the discussion above, c1 \(γ n+1 1n \) is the canonical generator of H \(CP n ; Z\), where γ1n+1 2 1n is the canonical line bundle of lines in Cn+1 and points on the line\. This is the standard convention in algebraic topology\. In algebraic geometry, it is more usual to define Chern classes so that the first Chern class of the dual of γ n+1 1n is the canonical generator of H 2 \(CP n ; Z\)\. With this convention, the nth Chern class would be \(−1\)n cn \. It is often unclear in the literature which convention is being followed\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Consider bundles ξ : Y −→ B with fiber G\. For spaces U in a numerable open cover O of B, there are homeomorphisms φ : U ×G −→ p−1 \(U \) such that p◦φ = π1 \. We say that Y is a principal G-bundle if Y has a free right action by G, B is the orbit space Y /G, ξ is the quotient map, and the φ are maps of right G-spaces\. We say that ξ : Y −→ B is a universal principal G-bundle if Y is a contractible space\. In particular, for any topological group G whose identity element is a nondegenerate basepoint, such as any Lie group G, the map p : EG −→ BG constructed in Chapter 16 §5 is a universal principal G-bundle (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- There is a classification theorem for principal G-bundles\. Let PG\(B\) denote the set of equivalence classes of principal G-bundles over B, where two principal G-bundles over B are equivalent if there is a G-homeomorphism over B between them\. Via pullback of bundles, this is a contravariant set-valued functor on the homotopy category of spaces\. Theorem\. Let γ : Y −→ Y /G be any universal principal G-bundle\. The natural transformation Φ : [−, Y /G] −→ PG\(−\) obtained by sending the homotopy class of a map f : B −→ Y /G to the equivalence class of the principal G-bundle f ∗ Y is a natural isomorphism of functors\.

- For a principal Gbundle Y , let G act on Y × F by g\(y, f \) = \(yg −1 , gf \) and let Y ×G F be the orbit space \(Y × F \)/G\. With the correct formal definition of a fiber bundle with group G and fiber F , every such fiber bundle p : E −→ B is equivalent to one of the form Y ×G F −→ Y /G ∼ = ∼ = B for some principal G-bundle Y over B (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- We conclude that, for any F , PG\(B\) is naturally isomorphic to the set of equivalence classes of bundles with group G and fiber F over B\. Fiber bundles with group O\(n\) and fiber Rn are real n-plane bundles, fiber bundles with group U \(n\) and fiber C n are complex n-plane bundles, and fiber bundles with group SO\(n\) and fiber Rn are oriented real n-plane bundles\. Thus the classification theorems of the previous sections could all be rederived as special cases of the general classification theorem for principal G-bundles stated in this section (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- There is a standard construction, called the Grothendieck construction, of an Abelian group G\(M \) associated to an Abelian monoid M : one takes the quotient of the free Abelian group generated by the elements of M by the subgroup generated by the set of elements of the form m + n − m ⊕ n, where ⊕ is the sum in M \. The evident morphism of Abelian monoids i : M −→ G\(M \) is universal: for any homomorphism of monoids f : M −→ G, where G is an Abelian group, there is a unique homomorphism of groups f ˜ f˜ : G\(M \) −→ G such that f ˜ f˜ ◦ i = f (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- we have the function d : V ect\(X\) −→ Z that sends a vector bundle to the dimension of its restriction to the component of the basepoint ∗\. Since d is a homomorphism of semi-rings, it induces a dimension function d : K\(X\) −→ Z, which is a homomorphism of rings\. Since d is an isomorphism when X is a point, d can be identified with the induced map K\(X\) −→ K\(∗\)\. Definition\. The reduced K-theory ̃ K̃\(X\) of a based space X is the kernel of d : K\(X\) −→ Z\. It is an ideal of K\(X\) and thus a ring without identity\. Clearly K\(X\) ∼ = ∼ = K ̃ K̃\(X\) × Z\.

- We have a resulting reduced cohomology theory on based spaces such that ̃ K̃ 2i \(X\) = K̃\(X\) and K̃ 2i+1 \(X\) = K̃\(ΣX\) for all integers i\. This theory has products that are induced by tensor products of bundles over compact spaces and that are induced by suitable maps φ : KUi ∧ KUj −→ KUi+j in general, just as for the cup product in ordinary cohomology\. It is standard to view this simply as a Z2 -graded theory with groups ̃ K̃ 0 \(X\) and K̃ 1 \(X\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Definition\. Let E0 be the zero section of E\. Define the projective bundle π : P \(E\) −→ X by letting the non-zero complex numbers act on E − E0 by scalar multiplication on fibers and taking the orbit space under this action\. Equivalently, the fiber π −1 \(x\) ⊂ P \(E\) is the complex projective space of lines through the origin in the fiber ξ −1 \(x\) ⊂ E\. Define the canonical line bundle L\(E\) over P \(E\) to be the subbundle of the pullback π ∗ E of ξ along π whose points are the pairs consisting of a line in a fiber of E and a point on that line\. Let Q\(E\) be the quotient bundle π ∗ E/L\(E\) and let H\(E\) denote the dual of L\(E\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- One first a line bundle E, L\(E\) = E and c1 \(E\) = c′1 \(E\) by the definition of x\. One first verifies by direct calculation that if E = L1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ln is a sum of line bundles, then ′ 1≤k≤n \(x − c1 \(Lk \)\) = 0\. This implies that ck \(E\) is the kth elementary symmetric 1≤k≤n ′ \(x − c1 \(Lk \)\) = 0\. This implies that ck k \(E\) is the kth elementary symmetric Q polynomial in the c1 \(Lk \)\. By the Whitney sum formula for the Chern classes, this implies that c′k k \(E\) = ck \(E\) in this case (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- For line bundles L and L′ , we have c1 \(L ⊗ L′ \) = c1 \(L\) + c1 \(L′ \)\. One way to see this is to recall that BU \(1\) ≃ K\(Z, 2\) and that line bundles are classified by their Chern classes regarded as elements of [X+ , BU \(1\)] ∼ = ∼ = H 2 \(X; Z\)\.

- We give one of the most beautiful and impressive illustrations of the philosophy described in the first chapter\. We define a numerical invariant, called the “Hopf invariant,” of maps f : S 2n−1 −→ S n and show that it can only rarely take the value one\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- We then indicate several problems whose solution can be reduced to the question of when such maps f take the value one\. Adams’ original solution to the Hopf invariant one problem used secondary cohomology operations in ordinary cohomology and was a critical starting point of modern algebraic topology\. The later realization that a problem that required secondary operations in ordinary cohomology could be solved much more simply using primary operations in Ktheory had a profound impact on the further development of the subject\.

- We shall describe the cobordism of smooth closed manifolds, but this is in fact a particularly elementary example\. Other examples include smooth closed manifolds with extra structure on their stable normal bundles: orientation, complex structure, Spin structure, or symplectic structure for example\. All of these except the symplectic case have been computed completely\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- The area is pervaded by insights from algebraic topology that are quite mysterious geometrically\. For example, the complex cobordism groups turn out to be concentrated in even degrees: every smooth closed manifold of odd dimension with a complex structure on its stable normal bundle is the boundary of a compact manifold \(with compatible bundle information\)\. However, there is no geometric understanding of why this should be the case\. The analogue with “complex” replaced by “symplectic” is false\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- In fact, this definition of cohomology is inappropriate in general, differing from the appropriate definition by a lim 1 error term\. However, the definition is correct when k ∗ is ordinary cohomology with coefficients in a field R and each H̃ n+q \(Tq ; R\) is a finite dimensional vector space over R\.

- We think of prespectra as “stable objects” that have associated homotopy, homology, and cohomology groups\. Imagine that we have a good category of stable objects, analogous to the category of based spaces, that is equipped with all of the constructions that we have on based spaces: wedges \(= coproducts\), colimits, products, limits, suspensions, loops, homotopies, cofiber sequences, fiber sequences, smash products, function objects, and so forth\. Let us call the stable objects in our imagined category “spectra” and call the category of such objects S \. We have in mind an analogy with the notions of presheaf and sheaf\.

- That is, we develop a theory of CW spectra using sphere spectra as the domains of attaching maps (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- The Whitehead and cellular approximation theorems hold, and every spectrum X admits a CW approximation ΓX −→ X\. We define the set [X, Y ] of morphisms X −→ Y in h̄ h̄S to be the set of homotopy classes of maps ΓX −→ ΓY \. This is a stable category in the sense that the functor Σ : h̄ h̄S −→ h h̄ h̄S is an equivalence of categories\. More explicitly, the natural maps X −→ ΩΣX and ΣΩX −→ X are isomorphisms in h h̄ h̄S \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- However, these early constructions were far more primitive than our outline suggests\. While they gave a satisfactory stable category, the underlying category of spectra did not have products, limits, and function objects, and its smash product was not associative, commutative, or unital\. In fact, a fully satisfactory category of spectra was not constructed until 1995\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- Definition\. A spectrum E is a prespectrum such that the adjoints σ̃ : En −→ ΩEn+1 of the structure maps σ : ΣEn −→ En+1 are homeomorphisms\. A map f : T −→ T ′ of prespectra is a sequence of maps fn : Tn −→ Tn′ such that σ ′ n′ ◦ Σfn = fn+1 ◦ σn for all n\. A map f : E −→ E ′ of spectra is a map between E and E ′ regarded as prespectra\.

- We define wedges and colimits of spectra by first performing the construction on the prespectrum level and then applying the functor L\. If we start with spectra and construct products or limits spacewise, then the result is again a spectrum; that is, limits of spectra are the limits of their underlying prespectra\. Thus the category S is complete and cocomplete\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

- We now have cylinders E ∧ I+ and thus can define homotopies between maps of spectra\.

- Similarly, we define the smash product T ∧X and function prespectrum F \(X, T \) of a based space X and a prespectrum T spacewise\. For a spectrum E, we define E ∧ X by applying L to the prespectrum level construction; the prespectrum F \(X, E\) is already a spectrum\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- The essential point is that homotopy and homology commute with colimits\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=241" target="_blank">J. Peter May 241</a>)
- It is not true that cohomology converts colimits to limits in general, because of lim 1 error terms, and this is one reason that our definition of the cohomology of prespectra via limits is inappropriate except under restrictions that guarantee the vanishing of lim 1 terms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- We define QX = ∪Ωq Σq X, and we find that the nth space of Σ∞ X is QΣn X\. It should be apparent that the homotopy groups of the space QX are the stable homotopy groups of X\.

- Thus, if we have a prespectrum T whose invariants we are interested in, such as an Eilenberg-Mac Lane Ω-prespectrum or the K-theory Ω-prespectrum, then we can construct a spectrum LKT that has the same invariants (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

- \. Localization and completion; rational homotopy theory Since the early 1970s, it has been standard practice in algebraic topology to localize and complete topological spaces, and not just their algebraic invariants, at sets of primes and then to study the subject one prime at a time, or rationally\. Two of the basic original references are: D\. Sullivan\. The genetics of homotopy theory and the Adams conjecture\. Annals of Math\. 100\(1974\), 1–79\. A\.K\. Bousfield and D\.M\. Kan\. Homotopy limits, completions, and localizations\. Lecture Notes in Mathematics Vol\. 304\. Springer-Verlag\. 1972\. A more accessible introduction to localization and a readable recent paper on completion are: P\. Hilton, G\. Mislin, and J\. Roitberg\. Localization of nilpotent groups and spaces\. North-Holland\. 1975\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=249" target="_blank">J. Peter May 249</a>)
- When spaces are rationalized, there is a completely algebraic description of the result\. The main original reference and a more accessible source are: D\. Sullivan\. Infinitesimal computations in topology\. Publ\. Math\. IHES 47\(1978\), 269–332\. A\.K\. Bousfield and V\.K\.A\.M\. Gugenheim\. On PL de Rham theory and rational homotopy type\. Memoirs Amer\. Math\. Soc\. No\. 179\. 1976 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=249" target="_blank">J. Peter May 249</a>)
- Another area well established by the mid-1970s\. The following book is a delightful read, with capsule introductions of many topics other than infinite loop space theory, a very pleasant starting place for learning modern algebraic topology: J\.F\. Adams\. Infinite loop spaces\. Annals of Math\. Studies No\. 90\. Princeton University Press\. 1978 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=249" target="_blank">J. Peter May 249</a>)
- The following survey article is less easy going, but gives an indication of the applications to high dimensional geometric topology and to algebraic K-theory: J\.P\. May\. Infinite loop space theory\. Bull\. Amer\. Math\. Soc\. 83\(1977\), 456–494\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=249" target="_blank">J. Peter May 249</a>)
- Adams’ book cited in §16 gives a spectral sequence for the computation of stable homotopy groups in terms of generalized cohomology theories\. Starting from complex cobordism and related theories, its use has been central to two waves of major developments in stable homotopy theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=250" target="_blank">J. Peter May 250</a>)
- A good exposition for the first wave: D\.C\. Ravenel\. Complex cobordism and stable homotopy groups of spheres\. Academic Press\. 1986\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=250" target="_blank">J. Peter May 250</a>)
- The essential original paper and a very nice survey article on the second wave: E\. Devinatz, M\.J\. Hopkins, and J\.H\. Smith\. Nilpotence and stable homotopy theory\. Annals of Math\. 128\(1988\), 207–242\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=250" target="_blank">J. Peter May 250</a>)
- The cited Proceedings contain good introductory survey articles on several other topics in algebraic topology\. A larger scale exposition of the second wave is: D\.C\. Ravenel\. Nilpotence and periodicity in stable homotopy theory\. Annals of Math\. Studies No\. 128\. Princeton University Press\. 1992\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=250" target="_blank">J. Peter May 250</a>)
- There is a leap from the level of this introductory book to that of the most recent work in the subject\. One recent book that helps fill the gap is: P\. Selick\. Introduction to homotopy theory\. Fields Institute Monographs No\. 9\. American Mathematical Society\. 1997 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=250" target="_blank">J. Peter May 250</a>)
- There is a recent expository book for the reader who would like to jump right in and see the current state of algebraic topology; although it focuses on equivariant theory, it contains introductions and discussions of many non-equivariant topics: J\.P\. May et al\. Equivariant homotopy and cohomology theory\. NSF-CBMS Regional Conference Monograph\. 1996\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=250" target="_blank">J. Peter May 250</a>)
- For the reader of the last section of this book whose appetite has been whetted for more stable homotopy theory, there is an expository article that motivates and explains the properties that a satisfactory category of spectra should have: J\.P\. May\. Stable algebraic topology and stable topological algebra\. Bulletin London Math\. Soc\. 30\(1998\), 225–234 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

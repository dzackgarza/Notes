## Highlights

- For many years, Algebraic Topology rests on three legs: “ordinary” Cohomology, K-theory, and Cobordism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Budyak 6</a>)
- The pioneering work of Pontryagin and Thom forged a deep connection between certain geometric problems \(such as the classiﬁcation of manifolds\) and homotopy theory, through the medium of the Thom space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Budyak 6</a>)
- Computations become possible upon stabilization, and this provided some of the ﬁrst and most compelling examples of “spectra\.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Budyak 6</a>)
- This international tradition was continued with the more or less simultaneous work by Novikov and Milnor on complex cobordism, and later by Quillen\. More recently Dennis Sullivan opened the way to the study of “manifolds with singularities,” a study taken up most forcefully by the Russian school, notably by Vershinin, Botvinnik, and Rudyak\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Budyak 6</a>)
- There is a ﬁne introduction to the stable homotopy category\. The subtle and increasingly important issue of phantom maps is addressed here with care\. Equally careful is the treatment of orientability (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Budyak 6</a>)
- The contents of this book are concentrated around Thom spaces \(spectra\), orientability theory and \(co\)bordism theory \(including \(co\)bordism with singularities\), framed by \(co\)homology theories and spectra\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">Budyak 10</a>)
- we consider the \(inter\)connections between geometry and homotopy theory, since Thom spectra and related matters are now the main tools for this interplay (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Budyak 11</a>)
- of the ﬁrst results in this area was the Gauss–Bonnet formula, relating a geometrical invariant \(the curvature\) to a homotopical one \(the Euler characteristic\)\. Proceeding, we can recall the Riemann–Roch Theorem, the Poincaré integrality theory, relationships between critical points of a smooth function on a smooth manifold and its homotopy type \(Lusternik– Schnirelmann, Morse\), the de Rham Theorem, etc\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Budyak 11</a>)
- The term “cohomology theory” is used for what was previously called “generalized” or “extraordinary” cohomology theory, i\.e\., for functors which satisfy all the Eilenberg– Steenrod axioms except the dimension axioms\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Budyak 11</a>)
- Every homology theory h∗ \(−\) yields a so-called dual cohomology theory h ∗ \(−\), and vice versa\. They are connected via the equality  h  h i \(X\) =  h  hn−i \(Y \) where Y is n-dual to X \(and tilde denotes the reduced \(co\)homology\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Budyak 11</a>)
- Thom spaces\. The Thom space T ξ of a locally trivial Rn -bundle ξ = {p : E → B} is deﬁned as follows\. Let ξ • be the S n -bundle obtained from ξ by the ﬁberwise one-point compactiﬁcation, and let E • be the total space of ξ \. Then the “inﬁnities” of the ﬁbers form a section s : B → E • , and we deﬁne T ξ := E • /s\(B\)\. Furthermore, the Thom space of a spherical ﬁbration {p : E → B} is the cone C\(p\) of the projection (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)
- p\. For example, the Thom space of the Rn -bundle over a point is S n , the Thom space of the open Möbius band \(considered as the R1 -bundle over S 1 \) is the real projective plane RP 2 , the Thom space of the Hopf bundle S 3 → S 2 \(with ﬁber S 1 \) is the complex projective plane CP 2 \. We use Thom’s notation M On for the Thom space T γ n of the universal n-dimensional vector bundle γ n over the classifying space BOn , i\.e\., M On := T γ n ; e\.g\., M O1 = RP ∞ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)
- \.C\. Whitehead observed the importance of the structure on the normal bundle in classifying structures on manifolds\. It turns out that Thom spaces establish an adequate context for this\. Namely, for every closed smooth manifold M n , the set of \(diﬀeomorphism classes of\) smooth manifolds homotopy equivalent to M is controlled by the group πn+N \(T ν\), where ν is the normal bundle of an embedding of M in Rn+N with N large enough (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)
- This is closely related to the Milnor–Spanier–Atiyah Duality Theorem, which asserts that T ν and M/∂M are stable N -dual for every compact manifold M \. This theorem clariﬁes connections between manifolds and their normal bundles and enables us to transmit properties of bundles to properties of manifolds\. For example, we have the Thom isomorphism ϕ : H i \(X; Z/2\) →  H  H i+n \(T ξ; Z/2\) for every locally trivial Rn -bundle ξ over a space X, and the above theorem transforms it to the Poincaré duality H i \(M ; Z/2\) ∼ = ∼ = Hn−i \(M, ∂M ; Z/2\) for every compact n-dimensional manifold M \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)
- Turning to another example, I recall the Thom formula wi \(ξ\) = ϕ −1 Sq i uξ where ξ is an n-dimensional vector bundle over a space X, wi \(ξ\) is its i-th Stiefel–Whitney class, ϕ : H i \(X; Z/2\) →  H  H i+n \(T ξ; Z/2\) is the Thom isomorphism and uξ ∈ H \(T ξ; Z/2\) is the Thom class of ξ\. This formula expands n a geometric invariant \(the Stiefel–Whitney class\) via the Steenrod operation which is a purely homotopic thing\. Moreover, we can use the formula in order to deﬁne the Stiefel–Whitney classes of spherical ﬁbrations\. In particular, it becomes clear that the Stiefel–Whitney classes are invariants of the ﬁber homotopy type of a vector bundle (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)
- Generalizing, we can consider an arbitrary natural transformation τ : h ∗ → k ∗ of cohomology theories instead of Sq i \. Then, under suitable conditions on ξ, there is a generalized Thom class u hξ ∈  h  h n \(T ξ\) and a generalized Thom isomorphism ϕk : k i \(X\) →  k  k i+n \(T ξ\), and so we can form the class K\(ξ\) = ϕ −1 k τ u h ξ which is an analogue and generalization of the Stiefel–Whitney class (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)
- So, we have a large source of invariants of Rn -bundles\. For example, the Todd genus and the  A  genus are particular cases of this construction\. Moreover, the wellA known integrality theorems which are related to Todd and  A  genera can be A generalized for the class K (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)
- Pontrjagin [1] proved that if a manifold bounds then all its characteristic numbers are trivial\. In particular, RP 2 does not bound because w2 \(RP 2 \) = 0\. So, N2 = 0, i\.e\., some groups Nk are non-trivial (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)
- Well, but how to compute Nk ? Clearly, N0 = Z/2, N1 = 0\. Using the classiﬁcation of closed surfaces, one can prove that N2 = Z/2: every orientable surface bounds, and every non-orientable surface either bounds or is bordant to RP 2 ; and RP 2 does not bound (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)
- Rokhlin [1] proved that N3 = 0, using complicated and tricky geometry\. The further computation of Nk looked absolutely hopeless; however this was done by Thom [2] via an exciting and successful application of homotopy theory\. Namely, Thom proved that N k = πk+N \(M ON \) for N large enough (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)
- he answer is N∗ = Z/2 [xi ], dim xi = i, i ∈ N, i = 2s − 1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)
- where N∗ = ⊕Nk is the graded ring with the multiplication induced by the direct product of manifolds (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)
- The above constructions can be generalized: we can consider oriented manifolds or, more generally, manifolds equipped with some extra structures\. As above, there arise certain bordism groups, and they can be interpreted as homotopy groups of certain Thom spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Budyak 14</a>)
- We use a category of spectra proposed by Adams [5]\. So, a spectrum E is a sequence {En , sn }∞ n=−∞ of pointed CW -spaces En and pointed CW embeddings sn : SEn → En+1 where S denotes the pointed suspension\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Budyak 14</a>)
- \(1\) For every pointed space X we have the spectrum Σ ∞ X = {S n X, sn } where sn : SS n X → S n+1 X is the identity map\. \(2\) For every pointed space X and every spectrum E = {En , sn } we have the spectrum X ∧ E = {X ∧ En , 1 ∧ sn }\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Budyak 14</a>)
- \(3\) Let θ 1 be the trivial 1-dimensional vector bundle over BOn , and let the map BOn → BOn+1 \(assuming it to be an embedding\) classify the vector bundle γ n ⊕ θ1 \. Then we have a map sn : T \(γ n ⊕ θ1 \) → T γ n+1 \. Moreover, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Budyak 14</a>)
- Clearly, Nk = Nk \(pt\)\. Moreover, N k \(X\) = πk+N \(X + ∧ M ON \) for N large enough, where X + is the disjoint union of the space X and a point\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Budyak 14</a>)
- one can prove that T \(γ n ⊕ θ1 \) = ST γ n = SM On , and so we have the Thom spectrum M O = {M On , sn (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Budyak 15</a>)
- Given a spectrum E, we have the homomorphisms hk,n : πk \(En \) → πk+1 \(SEn \) \(sn \)∗ \(sn \)∗ −−−→ πk+1 \(En+1 \)\. We deﬁne the homotopy group πk \(E\) to be the direct limit of the sequence ··· − → πk+n \(En \) hk+n,n hk+n,n −−−−→ πk+n+1 \(En+1 \) − → ··· , i\.e\., πk \(E\) = lim n→∞ πi+n \(En \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Budyak 15</a>)
- N k = πk \(M O\), Nk \(X\) = πk \(X + ∧ M O\) and so get rid of “N large enough” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Budyak 15</a>)
- Every spectrum E yields a homology theory E∗ \(−\) and a cohomology theory E ∗ \(−\) by the formulae Ei \(X\) := lim n→∞ πi+n \(X + ∧ En \), E i \(X\) := lim n→∞ [S n X + , Ei+n ]\. Moreover, E∗ \(−\) and E ∗ \(−\) are dual to each other\. Conversely, every \(co\)homology theory can be represented by a spectrum via the above formulae\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Budyak 15</a>)
- Note that, in particular, the spectrum M O yields the bordism \(resp\. cobordism\) theory N∗ \(−\) \(resp\. N∗ \(−\)\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Budyak 15</a>)
- Orientability\. We consider in this book orientability with respect to arbitrary cohomology theories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Budyak 15</a>)
- Similarly, we deﬁne a locally trivial Rn -bundle ξ over a connected base to be orientable if H n \(T ξ\) = Z, and an orientation of ξ is a generator of the group H n \(T ξ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Budyak 16</a>)
- For example, an h-orientation of an Rn -bundle ξ is a suitable element uξ ∈  h  h n \(T ξ\), an horientation of a closed manifold M n is an element [M ] ∈ hn \(M n \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Budyak 16</a>)
- Furthermore, one can develop an elegant theory of characteristic classes taking values in h∗ \(−\) provided that all complex vector bundles are horientable; these classes generalize the classical Chern classes\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Budyak 16</a>)
- As the last example, we mention that general orientabilty theory provides a formal group input to algebraic topology; this matter is completely degenerate for classical cohomology, and so this remarkable theory was able to appear only under the general approac (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Budyak 16</a>)
- oach\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Budyak 16</a>)
- \(Co\)bordism with singularities\. \(Co\)bordism with singularities is now a common and convenient notion, being a favorite tool as well as subject of research in algebraic topology\. Roughly speaking, we take a class of manifolds and extend it to a class of suitable polyhedra \(manifolds with singularities\) where a notion of a boundary is reasonably deﬁned (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Budyak 16</a>)
- Moreover, the famous Morava k-theories are also constructed as certain cobordism with singularities (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Budyak 17</a>)
- ories are also constructed as certain cobordism with singularities\. I also want to mention an application of \(co\)bordism with singularities to the topological quantum ﬁeld theory: for example, the elliptic \(co\)homology can be constructed as \(co\)bordism with singularities (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Budyak 17</a>)
- Finally, \(co\)bordism with singularities gives a natural geometric ﬂavor to algebraic or homotopical matters\. For example, the Adams resolution of certain spectra can be interpreted in terms of \(co\)bordism with singularities, and this enables us to get useful information about some classical \(co\)bordism theories, like M SU and M Sp (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Budyak 17</a>)

- The paper Thom [2] made a revolution and formed the contemporary paradigm of algebraic topology, and it freshly demonstrated the power and usefulness of the relations between homotopy theory and geometry\. In order to exhibit relatively recent advantages of this matter, I just write down a list \(unavoidably incomplete\) of certain geometric problems which were \(partially or completely\) solved via an application of homotopy theory\. 1 \(1\) When can a manifold M be immersed in a manifold N , and how can one classify these immersions? \(Smale [1], Hirsch [1]\.\) \(2\) When can a homology class in a space be realized by a map of a closed manifold? \(Thom [2]\.\) \(3\) When is a closed manifold a boundary of a compact manifold with boundary? \(Thom [2]\.\) \(4\) Which spaces are homotopy equivalent to closed smooth manifolds? \(Browder [1,2], Novikov [2,3]\.\) \(5\) How can one classify manifolds up to diﬀeomorphism \(PL isomorphism, homeomorphism\)? \(Smale [1], Kervaire–Milnor [1], Browder [1,2], Novikov [2,3], Hirsch–Mazur [1], Sullivan [1], Kirby–Siebenmann [1], Freedman [1], Donaldson [1]\.\) \(6\) How many pointwise linearly independent tangent vector ﬁelds exist on the n-dimensional sphere? \(Adams [3]\.\) \(7\) Which smooth manifolds admit a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature? \(Gromov–Lawson [1], Stolz [1]\.\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Budyak 17</a>)
- The category consisting of sets \(as objects\) and functions \(as morphisms\) is denoted by E ns\. The category of pointed sets and pointed functions is denoted by E ns• \.

- partially ordered set, or a poset, is a quasi-ordered set with the following condition: if λ ≤ μ ≤ λ then λ = μ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Budyak 20</a>)
- A chain in a poset is a family {ai } such that, for every pair i, j of indices, either ai ≤ aj or aj ≤ ai \. An upper bound of the chain is any a such that a i ≤ a for every i\. A poset is called inductive if every chain in it has an upper bound\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Budyak 20</a>)
- 1\.3\. Zorn’s Lemma\. Every inductive set has a maximal element\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Budyak 20</a>)
- K → E ns is represented by a certain object B of K if there exists a natural equivalence F ∼ = TB \. In this case B is called a classifying or representing object for F \. Furthermore, F is called representable if it can be represented by some B\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Budyak 20</a>)
- 1\.4\. Deﬁnition\. We say that a contravariant functor F : K → E ns is represented by a certain object B of K if there exists a natu (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Budyak 20</a>)
- Let F, G : K → E ns be represented by B, C respectively\. It is obvious that every morphism f : B → C yields a natural transformation Tf : TB → TC and hence F → G\. The converse is also true\. ∼ = ∼ = ∼ = ∼ = 1\.5\. Lemma \(Yoneda\)\. Fix natural equivalences b : F −→ TB , c : G −→ TC \. For every natural transformation ϕ : F → G there exists a morphism f : B → C such that for every object X of K the diagram ϕ F \(X\) −−−−→ G\(X\) ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ b T f T Tf B \(X\) −−−−→ TC \(X\) commutes, and such a morphism f is unique\. In particular, the representing object B for F is determined by F uniquely up to isomorphism\.

- The category of abelian groups and homomorphisms is denoted by A G \. Note that the usual direct product of abelian groups is the categorical product in A G , while the usual direct sum is the categorical coproduct in A G \.

- In algebraic context, we reserve the word “unit” for the neutral element of a monoid \(group\)\. In particular, the multiplicative identity element of a ring is also called the unit\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=21" target="_blank">Budyak 21</a>)
- Given a commutative ring R, we denote by R[x, y, \. \. \. , z] the polynomial ring of indeterminates x, y, \. \. \. , z\. The corresponding power series ring is denoted by R[[x, y, \. \. \. , z]]\. If R is a graded ring, we assume that x, y, \. \. \. , z are homogeneous indeterminates\. Furthermore, ΛR \(x, y, \. \. \. , z\) denotes the free exterior algebra \(with a unit\) over R of indeterminates x, y, \. \. \. , z, and for a graded R we assume that x, y, \. \. \. , z have odd degrees\.

- Algebraic topologists prefer to deal with “nice” spaces, such as CW spaces\. However, a class of spaces in which algebraic topologists work should be closed under standard operations which topologists use\. In other words, the suitable category of spaces should be large enough to accommodate operations and small enough to rule out pathologies at the same time\. One such category was suggested by Steenrod [2] and improved by McCord [1]3 , and is known as the category of weak Hausdorﬀ compactly generated spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Budyak 24</a>)

Then the family {W \(ϕ, U \)} for all such pairs \(ϕ, U \) forms a subbasis of the compact-open topology on the set of maps from X to Y \.

- it was noticed that many useful constructions of algebraic topology \(K-functor, \(co\)bordism, etc\.\) are formally similar to \(co\)homology theories\. Afterwards the reason for this phenomenon was clariﬁed: namely, most of these constructions satisfy all the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms except the so-called dimension axiom\. So, it seemed reasonable to consider the objects satisfying these axioms\. These objects were called extraordinary \(co\)homology theories\. However, later mathematicians came to call these objects just \(co\)homology theories, while H\(−; G\) got the name ordinary \(co\)homology theory\. 5 Now this terminology is commonly accepted, and we use it in this book\.

- \(iii\) Given a prime p, let C be the class of all abelian groups having pprimary exponents \(i\.e\., for every A ∈ C there exists k such that pk A = 0\)\.

- 4\.32\. Theorem-Deﬁnition\. For every abelian group A, there exists a spectrum M \(A\) with the following properties: \(i\) πi \(M \(A\)\) = 0 for i < 0; \(ii\) π0 \(M \(A\)\) = A = H0 \(M \(A\)\); \(iii\) Hi \(M \(A\)\) = 0 for i = 0\.

- Moreover, these properties determine M \(A\) uniquely up to equivalence\. This spectrum M \(A\) is called the Moore spectrum of the abelian grou (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=104" target="_blank">Budyak 104</a>)
- Let Q be the ﬁeld of rational numbers\. Let p be a prime, and let Z[p] be the subring of Q consisting of all irreducible fractions with denominators relatively prime to p\. The Z[p]-localization of an abelian group A is the homomorphism A → A ⊗ Z[p], a → a ⊗ 1\. The group A ⊗ Z[p] is simpler than A in a certain sense: for example, it has no q-torsion if \(p, q\) = 1\. On the other hand, if we know the groups A ⊗ Z[p] for all p then we can obtain a lot of information about A; for example, if A is ﬁnitely generated then it is completely determined by the groups A ⊗ Z[p], where p runs through all primes\. So, we can describe an abelian group A via descriptions of the simpler groups A ⊗ Z[p], and this trick is very eﬀective\. For example, it is ∗ very convenient to describe the ring H ∗ \(HZ\) of cohomology operations via the rings H ∗ \(HZ[p]; Z[p]\)\. Also, localization enables us to ignore the torsions which are irrelevant to a particular problem\.

- More generally, it makes sense to consider subrings Λ of Q\. In this case the localization A → A ⊗ Λ deletes the q-torsion with q ∈ S, where S is the set of denominators of all irreducible fractions of Λ\.

- It is remarkable that the localization can be transferred from algebra to topology, and, in particular, one can consider the Z[p]-homotopy type of a space and a spectrum (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=106" target="_blank">Budyak 106</a>)

If the map ν : A → C, ν\(a\) = av, is monic for |a| ≤ m then the A-homomorphism η : A ⊗ GC → C, η\(a ⊗ x\) = a\(λx\) is monic on Bm \. Furthermore, η is epic and thus is an isomorphism in dimensions ≤ m\. Proof\.

- Hopf [1] found that ordinary \(co\)homology rings of Lie groups \(in fact, H-spaces\) had certain speciﬁc algebraic properties\. \(For example, the rational cohomology ring of a Lie group is a free commutative algebra\.\) Afterwards Borel [1] clariﬁed the situation: every algebra A \(over a ﬁeld\) admitting a diagonal Δ : A → A ⊗ A, Δ\(ab\) = Δ\(a\)Δ\(b\), has such properties\. Borel suggested the name “Hopf algebra” for such object; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=129" target="_blank">Budyak 129</a>)

- 1\.1\. Deﬁnition\. A map f : X → Y of spaces \(or a morphism of spectra\) is called an X -phantom if σ[f ] = ∗ while [f ] = ∗\. Similarly, an element a ∈ E ∗ \(X\) is an X -phantom if σ\(a\) = 0 while a = 0\.

- 1\.5\. Example of a weak phantom\. Let X = S n [1/3] be a Z[1/3]-localized sphere S n , n > 1, i\.e\., the telescope of a sequence f f f f Sn − → Sn − → ··· − → Sn − → ··· , where f : S n → S n is a map of degree 3\. If we regard S n as a CW -complex with two cells, we obtain a cellular decomposition of X with 0-, nand \(n+1\)dimensional cells\. This gives us a chain complex {C∗ \(X\), ∂∗ }, where Cn \(X\) has Z-basis {a1 , \. \. \. , ai , \. \. \. }, and Cn+1 \(X\) has Z-basis {b1 , \. \. \. , bn , \. \. \. }, and ∂ n+1 bi = ai − 3ai+1 \. Let X = {Xλ } be the family of all ﬁnite CW n+1 subcomplexes of X\. It is clear that HX \(X\) = H n+1 \(S n \) = 0\. On the other hand, H n+1 \(X\) = 0 because the cocycle ϕ : Cn+1 \(X\) → Z, ϕ\(bi \) = 1 for every i, is not a coboundary\. Indeed, if ϕ = δψ for some ψ : Cn \(X\) → Z, then ψ\(ai \) − 3ψ\(ai+1 \) = 1\. In particular, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=144" target="_blank">Budyak 144</a>)
- ψ\(a 1 \) = + 3k ψ\(ak+1 \) 2 for every k\. Hence, 3k divides 2ψ\(a1 \) + 1 for every k, and so 2ψ\(a1 \) = −1\. This is a contradiction\. Thus, the subgroup of weak phantoms of H n+1 \(X\) is nontrivial \(and even uncountable, see 5\.1 below\)\.

About search:

Use the following to search for tags and notebooks:

tag:tagname or t:tagname or #tagname
nb:notebook or @notebook
title:shortcuts to search by title

Use ! for "does not contain" a search term:

Notes in "notebook" without "todo" tag:
@notebook !#todo

Notes in "notebook" without any tags:
@notebook !#

Tagged notes except from "notebook":

# !@notebook

Note that !searchterm will not return results if it is the only search term.

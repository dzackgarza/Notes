We have two principal general criteria for a sequence of numbers to converge, namely, the Monotone Convergence Theorem and the Cauchy Convergence Criterion.

Theorem 9.7 Suppose that {ak} is a sequence of nonnegative numbers. Then the series 2:::~ 1 ak converges if and only if the sequence of partial sums is bounded; that is, there is a positive number M such that for every index n.

Since the function f is continuous, its restriction to each bounded interval is integrable (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=253" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 253</a>)</p>

For series whose terms are neither of one sign nor alternating in sign, it is natural to apply the Cauchy Convergence Criterion for Sequences to the sequence of partial sums (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=256" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 256</a>)</p>
It is sometimes useful, particularly when considering series, to restate the definition of a Cauchy sequence as follows: A sequence {sn} is a Cauchy sequence provided that for each positive number E there is an index N such that for each index n ::=::: N and any natural number k, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=256" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 256</a>)</p>

Definition Given a function f: D -+ IR and a sequence of functions {fn: D -+ JR}, we say that the sequence {fn: D-+ IR} converges pointwise to f: D -+ IR, or that {fn} converges pointwise on D to f, provided that for each point x in D, lim fn(x) = f(x).

Question A Suppose that each function fn : D --+ lR is continuous. Is the limit function f : D --+ lR also continuous ?

The sequence {fn} converges pointwise on I to the function f, and ii. The derived sequence {f~} converges uniformly on I to the function g.

The principal objective of this section is to show that if the function f : (r, r) -+ JR. is defined by the power series expansion for lxl < r, then f: (-r, r) -+ JR. is differentiable, and moreover, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=275" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 275</a>)</p>
The above computation is known as term-by-term differentiation of a series expansion (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=275" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 275</a>)</p>
The series .Z::~o ckxk is said to be convergen t uniformly on the set A provided that the sequence of partial sums {sn} converges uniformly on A to the function f.

Assume the following: There is a positive number M and a number a with 0 ~ a < 1 such that ~· for all indices k and all x in A . (9.30) Then the power series .Z::~o ckxk is uniformly convergent on A.

However, the Weierstrass Uniform Convergence Criterion asserts that a sequence of functions converges uniformly if and only if the sequence is uniformly Cauchy (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=276" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 276</a>)</p>
Moreover, each of the power series and converges uniformly on the interval [ -r, r ] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=277" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 277</a>)</p>
Suppose that the nonzero number x 0 is in the domain of convergence of the power series 'E~o ckxk. Let r be any positive number less than lxo 1.

1. Then the interval [-r, r] is in the domain of convergence of the power series 'E~o ckxk and also in the domain of convergence of the derived power series (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=277" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 277</a>)</p>
The general result follows by induction since, according to Theorem 9 .40, the derived series of any power series that converges on ( -r, r) is another power series that also converges on ( -r, r). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=279" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 279</a>)</p>
Then the function f: (-r, r) --+ lR has derivatives of all orders (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=279" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 279</a>)</p>
Since the series 2:::~ 0 ckxk converges at each point between R and r, according to Theorem 9.40, each of the series and converges uniformly on the interval [R, R].

The above theorem implies that a function defined by a power series expansion on the interval ( -r, r) coincides with its Taylor series expansion about 0; this is a uniqueness result for the coefficients of a power series expansion (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=280" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 280</a>)</p>
Weierstrass presented the first example of a continuous function f : IR -+ IR that has the remarkable property that there is no point at which it is differentiable (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=283" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 283</a>)</p>
We will prove that the sequence of functions {fn} is uniformly Cauchy on IR. Once this is proven, it follows from the Weierstrass Uniform Convergence Criterion that {fn} converges uniformly on IR. Then, by Theorem 9.31, we can conclude that the limit function f, being the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions, is continuous (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=283" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 283</a>)</p><hr># More Concise Algebraic Topology: Localization, Completion, and Model Categories, J.

The only other preliminary that we require and that cannot be found in most of the books cited above is the Serre spectral sequence.

By far the longer of these parts is an introduction to model category theory. This material can easily be overemphasized, to the detriment of concrete results and the nuances needed to prove them. For example, its use would in no way simplify anything in the first half of the book. However, its use allows us to complete the first half by giving a conceptual construction and characterization of localizations and completions of general, not necessarily nilpotent, spaces.

we can dualize the proof of the first theorem below (as given for example in [89]) to prove the second. Theorem 0.0.1.

The argument is based on the dualization of cell complexes to cocell complexes, of which Postnikov towers are examples, and of the Homotopy Extension and Lifting Property (HELP) to co-HELP. Once this dualization is understood, it becomes almost transparent how one can construct and study the localizations and completions of nilpotent spaces simply by inductively localizing or completing their Postnikov towers one cocell at a time (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For conceptual clarity, we offer a slight reformulation of the original definition of a model category that focuses on weak factorization systems (WFS’s): a model category consists of a subcategory of weak equivalences together with a pair of related WFS’ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Colocalization is dual to Bousfield localization, and this brings us to another reason for our introduction to model category theory, namely a perceived need for as simple and accessible an approach to Bousfield localization as possible. This is such a centrally important tool in modern algebraic topology (and algebraic geometry) that every student should see it (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In algebraic topology, algebras are always graded and often connected, meaning that they are zero in negative degrees and the ground field in degree zero.

Under this assumption, bialgebras automatically have antipodes, so that there is no distinction between Hopf algebras and bialgebras. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

This allows us to define the homotopy category HoU simply by identifying homotopic maps; it is equivalent to the homotopy category of all spaces in U , not necessarily CW homotopy types, that is formed by formally inverting the weak homotopy equivalences.

The conventions mean that, when passing to homotopy categories, we implicitly approximate all spaces by weakly homotopy equivalent CW complexes, as we can do by [89, §10.3].

Let ZT denote the ring of integers localized at T , that is, the subring of Q consisting of rationals expressible as fractions k/ℓ, where ℓ is a product of primes not in T .

Let Zp denote the ring of p-adic integers. Illogically, but to avoid conflict of notation, we write Ẑ ẐT for the product over p ∈ T of the rings Zp .

With k = Fp , such graded fields appear naturally in algebraic topology as the coefficients of certain generalized cohomology theories, called Morava Ktheories, and their homological algebra works exactly as for any other field, a fact that has real calculational applications (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In categorical language, the category Ab∗ of graded abelian groups is a symmetric monoidal category under ⊗, meaning that ⊗ is unital (with unit Z concentrated in degree 0), associative, and commutative up to coherent natural isomorphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For an algebraic topologist, the commutativity isomorphism γ : A ⊗ B −→ B ⊗ A is specified by γ(a ⊗ b) = (−1) pq b ⊗ a where deg(a) = p and deg(b) = q.

Definition 1.4.4. Take X = S n in Definition 1.4.1. The definition then specializes to define an action of the group π1 (Y, ∗) on the group πn (Y, ∗). When n = 1, this is the conjugation action of π1 (Y, ∗) on itself. A (connected) space Y is simple if π1 (Y, ∗) is abelian and acts trivially on πn (Y, ∗) for all n ≥ 2.

As observed there, the sets [X, Y ] are groups if X is a suspension or Y is a loop space and are abelian groups if X is a double suspension or Y is a double loop space. However, there is additional structure at the ends of these sequences that will play a role in our work. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

This is of greatest interest when Z = S 0 . Since [−, −] refers to based homotopy classes, [S 0 , X] = π0 (X) and the sequence becomes π1 (X) f ∗ / π1 (Y ) ι ∗ / π0 (F f ) p ∗ / π0 (X) f ∗ / π0 (Y ).

This specializes to give a group homomorphism π1 (B, b) −→ π0 (Aut(Fb )). Here Aut(Fb ) is the topological monoid of (unbased) homotopy equivalences of Fb . We think of π1 (B, b) as acting “up to homotopy” on the space Fb , meaning that an element β ∈ π1 (B, b) determines a well-defined homotopy class of homotopy equivalences Fb −→ Fb (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

(If p is a covering space, the action is by homeomorphisms, as in [89, p. 29].) As we shall use later, it follows that π1 (B) acts on the homology and cohomology groups of Fb .

Intuitively, homotopy colimits are constructed from ordinary categorical colimits by gluing in cylinders so as to give domains for homotopies that allow us to replace equalities between maps that appear in the specification of ordinary colimits by homotopies between maps (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Since homotopies between given maps are not unique, not even up to homotopy, homotopy colimits give weak colimits in the homotopy category, in the sense that they satisfy the existence but not the uniqueness property of ordinary colimits (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The equalizer E(α, β) of functions α, β : S −→ U is {s|α(s) = β(s)} ⊂ S, as we see by checking the universal property ([89, p. 16]).

The definition of lim1 Gi for an inverse sequence of abelian groups is given, for example, in [89, p. 146]. It generalizes to give a definition for not necessarily abelian groups. However, the result is only a set in general, not a group. Definition 2.1.8. Let γi : Gi+1 −→ Gi , i ≥ 0, be homomorphisms of groups. Define a right action of the group G = ×i Gi on the set S = ×i Gi by (si ) ∗ (gi ) = (g −1 si γi (gi+1 )). The set of orbits of S under this action is called lim1 Gi (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Observe that lim Gi is the set of elements of G that fix the element (1) ∈ S whose coordinates are the identity elements of the Gi .

Definition 2.1.12. Let X be a (based) CW complex with n-skeleton X n . A map f : X −→ Z is called a phantom map if the restriction of f to X n is null homotopic for all n.

Warning 2.1.13. This is the original use of the term “phantom map”, but the name is also used in some, but by no means all, of the more recent literature for maps f : X −→ Z such f ◦ g is null homotopic for all maps g : W −→ X, where W is a finite CW complex (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Of course, the two notions agree when X has finite skeleta (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 39</a>)</p>
The name comes from the fact that, with either definition, a phantom map f : X −→ Z induces the zero map on all homotopy, homology, and cohomology groups, since these invariants depend only on skeleta, and in fact only on composites f ◦ g, where g has finite domain (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The lim1 terms that appear in Propositions 2.1.9 and 2.2.9 are an essential, but inconvenient, part of algebraic topology.

We consider a sequence of homomorphisms γi : Gi+1 −→ Gi . For j > i, let γ = γi γi+1 · · · γj−1 : Gj −→ Gi and let Gj = im γ . We say that the sequence {Gi , γi } satisfies the Mittag–Leffler condition if for each i there exists j(i) such that Gki i = G j(i) i for all k > j(i). That is, these sequences of images eventually stabilize. For example, this condition clearly holds if each γi is an epimorphism or if each Gi is a finite group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proof. Using mapping cylinders, we can replace f by a cofibration [89, p. 42]. Since weak equivalences induce isomorphisms on homology and cohomology, relative CW approximation [89, p. 76] and cellular approximation of maps [89, p. 74] show that we can replace X and Y by CW complexes with the same q-skeleton and can replace f by a cellular map that is the identity on the q-skeleton. Since in dimensions less than q the cellular chains and thus the homology and cohomology groups of a CW complex depend only on its q-skeleton, the conclusion follows.

On the other hand, when G is abelian, a π-group is just a module over the group ring Z[π]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Clearly simple spaces and, in particular, simply connected spaces, are nilpotent. Connected H-spaces are simple and are therefore nilpotent. While it might seem preferable to restrict attention to simple or simply connected spaces, nilpotent spaces have significantly better closure properties under various operations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem 3.2.1. A connected space X is simple if and only if it admits a Postnikov tower of principal fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We can always construct maps αn : X −→ Xn such that αn induces an isomorphism on πi for i ≤ n and πi Xn = 0 for i > n just by attaching cells inductively to kill the homotopy groups of X in dimension greater than n.

When X is simple, and only then, we can arrange further that Xn+1 is the homotopy fiber of a “k-invariant” k n+2 : Xn −→ K(πn+1 X, n + 2). This is what it means for X to have a “Postnikov tower of principal fibrations”. The name comes from the fact that Xn+1 is then the pullback along k n+2 of the path space fibration over K(πn+1 X, n + 2). Of course, the fiber of the resulting map pn+1 : Xn+1 −→ Xn is an Eilenberg-MacLane space K(πn+1 X, n + 1). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

One then constructs k n+2 by killing the higher homotopy groups of the cofiber Cαn and defines Xn+1 to be the fiber of k n+2 . However, the proof there is not complete since the check requires a slightly strengthened version of homotopy excision or the relative Hurewicz theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Since right adjoints, such as P (−) or, more generally, F (X, −), preserve all categorical limits and since limits, such as pullbacks and sequential limits, commute with other limits, we find easily that products, pullbacks, and sequential limits of K -towers are again K -towers.

The circle S 1 is a K(Z, 1). Our first example of a localized space is ST1 T1 , which not surprisingly turns out to be K(ZT , 1). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Finally, consider A = Z, so that AT = ZT . The circle S 1 is a K(Z, 1). Our first example of a localized space is ST1 T1 , which not surprisingly turns out to be K(ZT , 1). AT can be constructed as the colimit of copies of Z together with the maps induced by multiplication by the primes not in T . For example, if we order the primes qi not in T by size and define rn inductively by r1 = q1 and rn = rn−1 q1 · · · qn = q1n . . . qn , then ZT is the colimit over n of the maps rn : Z −→ Z. We can realize these maps on π1 (S 1 ) by using the rn th power map S 1 −→ S 1 . Using the telescope construction ([89, p. 113]) to convert these multiplication maps into inclusions and passing to colimits, we obtain a space K(ZT , 1); the van Kampen theorem gives that the colimit has fundamental group ZT , and the higher homotopy groups are zero because a map from S n into the colimit has image in a finite stage of the telescope, which is equivalent to S 1 . The commutation of homology with colimits gives that the only non-zero reduced integral homology group of K(ZT , 1) is its first, which is ZT . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

One way to see this is to observe that the classifying space functor from groups to Eilenberg–Mac Lane spaces (e.g. [89, p. 126]) gives an inverse bijection to π1 , but it can also be verified directly from the elementary construction of K(G, 1)’s that is obtained by realizing π1 as the fundamental group of a space X ([89, p. 35]) and then killing the higher homotopy groups of X.

Using the homological characterization of localizations, we obtain analogues of the results in §6.2 for wedges, suspensions, cofiber sequences, and smash products. However, in the non-simply connected case, the required preservation of nilpotency is not automatic. Wedges behave badly, for example. The wedge S 1 ∨ S 1 is not nilpotent since a free group on two generators is not nilpotent, and the wedge S 1 ∨S 2 is not nilpotent since π1 does not act nilpotently on π2 .

Proposition 6.6.2. If Y is an H-space with product µ, then YT is an H-space with product µT such that the localization φ : Y −→ YT is a map of H-spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The converse does not hold. There are many interesting spaces that are not H-spaces but have localizations that are H-spaces. In fact, in 1960, well before localizations were constructed in general, Adams [2] observed that STn Tn is an Hspace for all odd n and all sets T of odd primes.

Since πn (STn ) = [STn , STn ] = ZT (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=111" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 111</a>)</p>
In contrast, S n itself is an H-space only if n = 0, 1, 3, or 7, by Adams’ solution to the Hopf invariant one problem [1]. Here the Lie group S 3 is not homotopy commutative and the H-space S 7 given by the unit Cayley numbers is not homotopy associative (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The study breaks into two main variants. In one of them, one allows general finite T -local H-spaces, not necessarily homotopy associative or commutative, and asks what possible underlying homotopy types they might have. In the other, one studies finite T -local loop spaces, namely spaces X that are of the homotopy type of finite T -CW complexes and are also homotopy equivalent to ΩBX for some T -local space BX. Such X arise as localizations of finite loop spaces. One asks, typically, how closely such spaces resemble compact Lie groups and what limitations the H-space structure forces on the homology and homotopy groups. The structure theorems for Hopf algebras that we give later provide a key starting point for answering such questions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

A co-H-space Z is a space with a coproduct δ : Z −→ Z ∨ Z such that ∇ ◦ δ is homotopic to the identity, where ∇ : Z ∨ Z −→ Z is the folding map. Suspensions ΣX with their pinch maps provide the canonical examples (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 6.6.4. For a simply connected co-H-space Z, the localization ZT can be constructed as the telescope of the sequence of rith ith -copower maps Z −→ Z.

Localization at the empty set of primes is called rationalization (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Many results in algebraic topology that preceded the theory of localization are conveniently proven using the newer theory. We illustrate this with a proof of a basic theorem of Serre on the finiteness of the homotopy groups of spheres. Serre proved the result using (Serre) classes of abelian groups [121]. The proof using rationalization is simpler and more illuminating. Theorem 6.7.1 (Serre). For n ≥ 1, the homotopy groups πq (S n ) are finite with the exceptions of πn (S n ) = Z for all n and π2n−1 (S n ) = Z ⊕ Fn for n even, where Fn is finite.

Proposition 6.7.2. The cohomology algebra H ∗ (K(Q, n); Q) is the exterior algebra on ιn if n is odd and the polynomial algebra on ιn if n is even. Proof. For n = 1 and n = 2, this is clear from Theorem 5.2.8 and the fact that S 1 = K(Z, 1) and CP ∞ = K(Z, 2). We proceed by induction on n, using the Serre spectral sequence of the path space fibration K(Q, n) −→ P K(Q, n + 1) −→ K(Q, n + 1). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

and the spectral sequence is concentrated on the 0th and nth rows. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 112</a>)</p>
Thus the rationalization of the homotopy group πq (S n ), q > 0, is 0 if q 6= 2n − 1 and is Q if q = 2n − 1. Since π2n−1 (S n ) is a finitely generated abelian group with rationalization Q, it must be the direct sum of Z and a finite group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=112" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 112</a>)</p>
This implies that all homotopy groups πq (S n ), q > n, are in the kernel of rationalization. That is, they are torsion groups. Since they are finitely generated by Theorem 4.5.7, they are finite.

Corollary 6.7.3. Consider the rationalization k0 : S n 0n −→ K(Q, n) of the canonical map k : S n −→ K(Z, n). If n is odd, k0 is an equivalence. If n is even, the fiber of k0 is K(Q, 2n − 1).

we give an observation that shows, in effect, that phantom maps are usually invisible to the eyes of rational homotopy theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In Chapter 5, we described how to construct localizations of nilpotent spaces. In the next chapter, we go in the opposite direction and describe how to start with local spaces and construct a “global space” and how to reconstruct a given global space from its localizations. Results such as these are referred to as fracture theorems (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We are mainly interested in the case when S is empty and localization at S is rationalization (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We are then starting with a partition of the set of primes in T , and we are most often interested in the case when T is the set of all primes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

I might be the positive integers and Ti might be the set consisting of just the ith prime number pi . A common situation is when I = {1, 2}, T1 = {p}, and T2 is the set of all other primes. For example, spaces often look very different when localized at 2 and when localized away from 2 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

It applies to any category that has categorical products. Such categories are said to be cartesian monoidal. Examples include the categories of abelian groups, groups, spaces, and sets. Less obviously, the homotopy category HoT is another example, even though pullbacks do not generally exist in HoT (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Lemma 7.1.9. In any cartesian monoidal category, a commutative diagram of the following form is a pullback. A (id,gf ) / f A×C f ×id  B (id,g) / B × C.

Remark 7.2.2. Theorem 7.2.1(ii) was proven under a finite generation hypothesis in Hilton, Mislin, and Roitberg [60], and Hilton and Mislin later noticed that the hypothesis can be removed [59]. That fact is not as well-known as it should be. We learned both it and most of the elegant proof presented here from Bousfield. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In §7.2, we started with a T -local group and showed that it was isomorphic to the pullback of some of its localizations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The name comes from the fact that when ω exists, it turns out that the map µi : P −→ Gi in (7.3.2) is a localization at Ti , hence the map ν is a localization at S and ω is the localization of (µi ) at S.

Definition 7.5.1. Let G be a nilpotent group. The extended genus of G is the collection of isomorphism types of nilpotent groups G ′ such that the localizations Gp and G′ ′p ′p are isomorphic for all primes p. If G is finitely generated, then the genus of G is the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated nilpotent groups in the extended genus of G. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Let Aut(G) denote the group of automorphisms of G. We show that elements of the extended genus are usually in bijective correspondence with double cosets (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Example 7.5.5. Let A = Z. An automorphism of Q is just a choice of a unit in Q, and similarly for Z(pi ) . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remark 7.5.8. The word “genus” is due to Mislin [102], following an analogy due to Sullivan [129], and has nothing to do with the use of the word elsewhere in mathematics. Rather, the analogy is with genetics or, perhaps better, taxonomy (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

This depends on the general observation that homotopy pullbacks of homotopy pullbacks are homotopy pullbacks (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

It says that to check whether or not two maps are homotopic, it suffices to check whether or not they become homotopic after localization at each prime p.

Recall too that Proposition 2.2.2 and Corollary 2.2.3 tell us how to compute the homotopy groups of homotopy pullbacks (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remark 8.3.7. We repeat Remark 7.2.2, since it applies verbatim here. Theorem 8.1.3 was proven under a finite generation hypothesis in Hilton, Mislin, and Roitberg [60], and Hilton and Mislin later noticed that the hypothesis can be removed [59]. That fact is not as well-known as it should be. We learned both it and most of the elegant proof presented here from Bousfield. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Much early work in the theory of localization focused on the concept of genus, which was introduced by Mislin [102] in the context of H-spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Having the homotopy type of a finite CW complex is not a generic property, by a counterexample of Mislin [103].

beautiful worked out example was given by Rector [114]. Theorem 8.5.8. The genus of HP ∞ is uncountably infinite (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 8.5.8. The genus of HP ∞ is uncountably infinite. For comparison, McGibbon [96] computed the genus of the finite nilpotent projective spaces RP 2n+1 , CP n and HP n for 1 ≤ n < ∞. For these spaces X, he uses pullbacks over X to give the set G(X) a group structure and proves the following result. Theorem 8.5.9. Let n be a positive integer. (i) G(RP 2n+1 ) = 1, (ii) G(CP n ) = 1, (iii) G(HP n ) ∼ = Z/2 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Z/2, where the number of factors equals the number of primes p such that 2 ≤ p ≤ 2n − 1.

As in the case of nilpotent groups, asking how unique formal localizations are gives a starting point of the analysis of the extended genus, and one can then seek the actual genus inside that (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Rather tautologically, a major theme of algebraic topology is the algebraization of homotopy theory. In some cases, the algebraization is complete, and this is true for rational homotopy theory, as proven by Quillen [110] and Sullivan [130 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

we show how to give it more topological content via the Samelson product on homotopy groups.

Definition 9.2.1. An H-monoid is a homotopy associative H-space. An Hgroup is an H-monoid with a map χ providing inverses up to homotopy, so that µ ◦ (id ×χ) ◦ ∆ ≃ ∗ ≃ µ ◦ (χ × id) ◦ ∆, where ∗ denotes the trivial map at the unit element e and µ is the product (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If we abuse notation by writing χ(x) = x −1 and writing µ(x, y) = xy, then the condition becomes “xx −1 = e = x −1 x” up to homotopy. An H-monoid is grouplike if π0 (X) is a group under the product induced by the product on X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

More elegantly, an H-space X is an H-monoid if the functor [−, X] is monoid– valued and is an H-group if the functor [−, X] is group–valued (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

This raises the question of whether or not there is a homotopical construction of a Lie bracket on π∗ (X) for an H-group X that is compatible under the Hurewicz homomorphism with the commutator in H∗ (X; Z). The answer is that indeed there is. The relevant product on homotopy groups is called the Samelson product (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 9.2.5. Let X be a connected H-group of finite type. Then H∗ (X; Q) is isomorphic as a Hopf algebra to U (π∗ (X) ⊗ Q), where π∗ (X) is regarded as a Lie algebra under the Samelson product.

It is most easily defined as a special case of the Samelson product (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We rewrite this as [−, −] : [ΣJ, X] ⊗ [ΣK, X] −→ [Σ(J ∧ K), X] and call it the generalized Whitehead product. Taking Taking J = S p−1 and K = S q−1 , this specializes to the Whitehead product [−, −] : πp (X) ⊗ πq (X) −→ πp+q−1 (X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

From this point of view, the Whitehead product [ip , iq ] is thought of as a map S p+q−1 −→ S p ∨ S q , and it is the attaching map for the construction of S p × S q from S p ∨ S q .

The Whitehead products appear in the EHP-sequence, which is the most important tool for the study of unstable homotopy groups. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Thinking of spaces, homotopy types, and spaces in the same genus as analogous to animals, animals in the same species, and animals in the same genus, algebraic topologists are expert at genetic modification to produce different species in the same genus.

We usually modify spaces using finite sets I, especially partitions of the primes into two disjoint sets T1 and T2 . In that case, the local to global fraction results go under the name of Zabrodsky mixing (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

They constructed an H-space X that is in the same genus as the Lie group Sp(2) but is not equivalent to it. Both X and Sp(2) are equivalent to S 3 × S 7 away from the primes 2 and 3. As is explained in [60, pp. 122-127], the three H-spaces in sight, X, Sp(2) and S 3 × S 7 , are total spaces of bundles over S 7 with fiber S 3 , and every simply connected finite H-space with rational cohomology E[x3 , x7 ] is equivalent to the total space of such a bundle.

It is usual to focus on a single prime p, and there is no loss of information in doing so since completion at T is the product over p ∈ T of the completions at p, and similarly for all relevant algebraic invariants (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In contrast to localization, completions of abelian groups can sensibly be defined in different ways, and the most relevant definitions are not standard fare in basic graduate algebra courses (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma 10.1.2. When restricted to finitely generated abelian groups, the p-adic completion functor is exact (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

.1.1. p-adic completion. It is usual to define the completion of an abelian group A at a given prime p to be the p-adic completion ̂ Âp = lim(A/p r A), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 159</a>)</p>
This definition will not fully serve our purposes since p-adic completion is neither left nor right exact in general, and exactness properties are essential to connect up with the topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

When A = Z, we write Zp instead of Z Ẑ Ẑp for the ring of p-adic integers, and we abbreviate Z/nZ to Z/n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Observe that the p-adic completion functor takes values (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Even if we restrict to finitely generated abelian groups, we notice one key point of difference between localization and completion. While a homomorphism of abelian groups between p-local groups is necessarily a map of Z(p) -modules, a homomorphism of abelian groups between p-adically complete abelian groups need not be a map of Zp -modules.

When A is finitely generated, p-adic completion is given by the map ψ : A −→ A⊗Zp specified by ψ(a) = a ⊗ 1, this again being a consequence of the Artin-Rees lemma (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Since Zp is torsion free, it is a flat Z-module, which gives us another way of seeing Lemma 10.1.2 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 160</a>)</p>
To overcome the lack of exactness of p-adic completion in general, we consider the left derived functors of the p-adic completion functor. For the knowledgable reader, we recall that left derived functors are usually defined only for right exact functors, in which case the 0th left derived functor agrees with the given functor (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 160</a>)</p>
The left derived functors of p-adic completion are given on an abelian group A by first taking a free resolution 0 −→ F ′ −→ F −→ A −→ 0 of A, then applying p-adic completion, and finally taking the homology of the resulting length two chain complex ̂p F̂ ′ p′ −→ ̂ F̂p (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 160</a>)</p>
Since kernels and cokernels of maps of Zp -modules are Zp -modules, since a free abelian group is its own free resolution, and since p-adic completion is exact when restricted to finitely generated abelian groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma 10.1.4. The functors L0 and L1 take values in Zp -modules. If A is either a finitely generated abelian group or a free abelian group, then L0 A = ̂ Âp , L1 A = 0, and φ : A −→ L0 A coincides with p-adic completion (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 10.1.5. Fix a prime p. We say that the completion of A at p is defined if L1 A = 0, and we then define the completion of A at p to be the homomorphism φ : A −→ L0 A. We say that A is p-complete if φ : A −→ L0 A is an isomorphism. As we shall see in Proposition 10.1.18, if A is p-complete, then L1 A = 0 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The essential exactness property of our derived functors, which is proven in the same way as the long exact sequences for Tor and Ext, reads as follows (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Of course, Ep A = 0 if A is a divisible and hence injective abelian group. Write Hom(Z/pr , A) = Ar for brevity.

The group ̂ F̂p /F is uniquely p-divisible.

In view of Example 10.1.14, we have an interesting explicit example where homotopy groups shift dimension. Example 10.3.3.

One might naively hope that, at least if X is f -nilpotent, ̃ H̃∗ ( ̂ X̂T ; Z) might be isomorphic to ̃ H̃∗ (X; Z) ⊗ Z Ẑ ẐT , in analogy with what is true for localization.

This notion was introduced and studied by Dwyer and Wilkerson [41], who showed how remarkably similar to compact Lie groups these X are. The completion of a compact Lie group is an example, but there are many others. Like compact Lie groups, p-compact groups have versions of maximal tori, normalizers of maximal tori, and Weyl groups. A complete classification, analogous to the classification of compact Lie groups, has recently been obtained (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

It is natural to think of completion at p as the composite of localization at p and completion at p (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Our algebraic local to global result reads as follows. Its hypotheses seem to be minimal, but it is instructive to compare it with Theorem 13.3.1, where the topology allows us to generalize to groups that are not completable at T .

We first develop conditions on the input that ensure that our local to global fracture theorem delivers f Ẑ ẐT -nilpotent groups as output. This is subtle since finite generation conditions on the input are not always sufficient. There are finitely generated T -complete groups that cannot be realized as the completions of finitely generated T -local groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 12.4.6. The adèlic genus of a finitely generated nilpotent group G is the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated nilpotent groups G ′ such that G0 is isomorphic to G′ ′0 ′0 and ̂ Ĝp is isomorphic to ̂ Ĝ′ ′p ′p for all primes p. The complete genus of G is defined by dropping the requirement that G0 be isomorphic to G′ 0 0 . The name “adèlic” is suggested by Sullivan’s analogy [131, 129] with the theory of adèles in number theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The conclusion would be that the adèlic genus of G is in bijective correspondence with the double cosets Aut H\ Aut (J0 )/ Aut J (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The following general observation is elementary but important. It helps explain why one should expect to be able to reconstruct T -local spaces from their rationalizations and their completions at T . Lemma 13.2.1. Let f : X −→ Y be any map. Then f∗ : H∗ (X; ZT ) −→ H∗ (Y ; ZT ) is an isomorphism if and only if f∗ : H∗ (X; Q) −→ H∗ (Y ; Q) and, for all p ∈ T , f∗ : H∗ (X; Fp ) −→ H∗ (Y ; Fp ) are isomorphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Indeed, homology commutes with sums and colimits of coefficient groups since this already holds on the chain level. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We saw in §12.4 that the lack of a functorial formal completion of nilpotent groups impeded the naive analysis of the complete genus of f -nilpotent groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The idea is to form the tensor product of a space X and a ring R to obtain a space “X ⊗R” such that π∗ (X ⊗R) is naturally isomorphic to π∗ (X)⊗R. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Since we want tensoring over R to be an exact functor on abelian groups, we also insist that the underlying abelian group of R be torsion free. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

For any set of primes S ⊂ T , the localization of X at S can be thought of as X ⊗ ZS and the completion of X at S can be thought of as X ⊗ Ẑ ẐS . We didn’t need the finite type hypothesis to conclude that π∗ (XS ) ∼ = ∼ = π∗ (X) ⊗ ZS , but we did need it to conclude that π∗ ( ̂ X̂S ) ∼ = ∼ = π∗ (X) ⊗ Ẑ ẐS . In both cases, with our X ⊗ R notation, we started with K(A, n) ⊗ R = K(A ⊗ R, n) and inducted up the Postnikov tower of X to obtain the construction. We explain how the same construction goes in our more general situation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

When T is the empty set, the realification of rational spaces case has been studied using the algebraization of rational homotopy theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The difficulty is that, in this generality, the cohomology of the EilenbergMac Lane spaces K(B ⊗ R, n) can be quite badly behaved. Thus we may not have enough cohomological control to start and continue the induction (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Of course, it suffices to define the functor on countable CW complexes since we are working in homotopy categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remember that localizations and completions are defined by universal properties in the homotopy category and so are not uniquely specified (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 13.6.5. The adèlic genus of an f -nilpotent space X is the set of homotopy classes of f -nilpotent spaces Y such that X0 is equivalent to Y0 and X ̂ X̂p is isomorphic to Y ̂ Ŷp for all primes p. The complete genus of X is defined by dropping the requirement that X0 be isomorphic to Y0 . Write ̂ Ĝ0 (X) for the adèlic genus of X and ̂ Ĝ(X) for the complete genus. Recall that G(X) denotes the (local) genus of X. If two spaces are in the same local genus, they are in the same adèlic genus, and if two spaces are in the same adèlic genus they are in the same complete genus. Therefore we have inclusions G(X) ⊂ G ̂ Ĝ0 (X) ⊂ G ̂ Ĝ(X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 13.6.6. For a simple space X of finite type, there is a canonical bijection between ̂ Ĝ0 (X) and the set of double cosets hAut(X0 )\hAut(F X0 )/hAut(F X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 13.6.7. If X is a simply connected finite CW complex, then ̂ Ĝ(X) and therefore ̂ Ĝ0 (X) and G(X) are finite sets. It is natural to ask if these three notions of genus are genuinely different (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Recall that the function space F (X, Y ) is nilpotent when X is finite and Y is of finite type (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 210</a>)</p>
Taking Y = X, this suggests that the automorphism groups above should be nilpotent, or nearly so, when X is finite and that their analysis should be closely related to the algebraic analysis of the genus of a finitely generated nilpotent group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem 13.6.8. Let X be an f -nilpotent space. If X0 admits an H-space structure, then ̂ Ĝ0 (X) = ̂ Ĝ(X). If, further, X is either π∗ -finite or H∗ -finite, then G(X) = ̂ Ĝ(X). However, there are simply connected examples such that ̂ Ĝ0 (X) 6= ̂ Ĝ(X), and these can be chosen to be π∗ -finite or H∗ -finite. Similarly, there are simply connected examples such that G(X) 6= ̂ Ĝ0 (X), and these too can be chosen to be π∗ -finite or H∗ -finite (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Say that X is π∗ -finite or H∗ -finite if it has only finitely many non-zero homotopy groups or only finitely many non-zero homology groups, all of them assumed to be finitely generated (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Model category theory is due to Quillen [112]. Nice introductions are given in [40, 51], and there are two expository books on the subject [63, 64] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In fact, by now the very term “homotopy theory” admits of two interpretations. There is the homotopy theory of topological spaces, which is the core of algebraic topology, and there is also homotopy theory as a general methodology applicable to many other subjects (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let M be a category. We insist that categories have sets of morphisms between pairs of objects; category theorists would say that M is locally small. Similarly, we understand limits and colimits to be small, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

meaning that they are defined with (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=213" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 213</a>)</p>
respect to functors out of small categories D. We assume once and for all that M is bicomplete. This means that M is complete (has all limits) and cocomplete (has all colimits). In particular, it has an initial object ∅ and a terminal object ∗ (the coproduct and product of the empty set of objects). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

A model structure on M consists of three interrelated classes of maps (W , C , F ), called the weak equivalences, the cofibrations, and the fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 214</a>)</p>
homotopy category HoM that is obtained by inverting the weak equivalences. This is a localization process that is analogous to the localization of rings at multiplicatively closed subsets, and it is characterized by an analogous universal property. Formally, this means that there must be a functor γ : M −→ HoM such that γ(w) is an isomorphism if w ∈ W and γ is initial with respect to this property.

Ponto 214</a>)</p>
One might attempt to construct HoM by means of words in the morphisms of M and formal inverses of the morphisms of W , but the result of such a construction is not locally small in general (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 14.1.1. A class K of maps in M is closed under retracts if, when given a commutative diagram (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The following observation is often applied to classical homotopy categories, where it shows that a retract of a homotopy equivalence is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

there can be many model structures on M with the same weak equivalences. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Transfinite colimits play a substantial role in the foundational literature of model category theory, and they are crucial to the construction of Bousfield localizations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 14.1.7. Let L be a class of maps in M . We say that L is left saturated if the following (redundant) closure properties hold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 14.1.10. An ordered pair (L , R) of classes of morphisms of M factors M if every morphism f : X −→ Y factors as a composite X i(f ) / Z(f ) p(f ) /Y with i(f ) ∈ L and p(f ) ∈ R.

Mapping cylinders and mapping path fibrations [89, pp 43, 48] give the original source for the following idea, but it also arises from analogous categorical contexts. Definition 14.1.11. A weak factorization system (WFS) of M is an ordered pair (L , R) of classes of morphisms of M that factors M and satisfies both L = R and R = L  (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The required equalities say that the maps in L are precisely the maps that have the LLP with respect to the maps in R and the maps in R are precisely the maps that have the RLP with respect to the maps in L .

Ponto 217</a>)</p>
Category theorists also study strong factorization systems, for which the relevant lifts λ are required to be unique. 3 The difference is analogous to the difference between the class of fibrations and the class of covering maps as the choice of R.

Definition 14.2.1. A model structure on M consists of classes (W , C , F ) of morphisms of M , the weak equivalences, cofibrations, and fibrations, such that (i) W has the two out of three property. (ii) (C , F ∩ W ) is a (functorial) weak factorization system. (iii) (C ∩ W , F ) is a (functorial) weak factorization system. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 218</a>)</p>
The maps in F ∩ W are called acyclic (or trivial) fibrations; those in C ∩ W are called acyclic (or trivial) cofibrations. The definition requires every map to factor both as the composite of a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration and as an acyclic cofibration followed by a fibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It also requires there to be a lift in any commutative square A i  E p  X > ~> ~ ~ ~ /B in which i is a cofibration, p is a fibration, and either i or p is acyclic (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 218</a>)</p>
By (14.2.2) and (14.2.3, to specify a model structure on a category with a chosen class of weak equivalences that satisfies the two out of three property, we need only specify either the cofibrations or the fibrations, not both (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

(14.2.4) C  (F ∩ W ) and F  (C ∩ W ). It is usual to define model categories by requiring (14.2.4) and requiring F , C , and W to be closed under retracts. The following observation (due to Joyal) shows that our axioms imply that W is closed under retracts and are therefore equivalent to the usual ones (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 219</a>)</p>
Lemma 14.2.5. The class W as well as the classes C , C ∩ W , F , and F ∩ W in a model structure are subcategories that contain all isomorphisms and are closed under retracts. Therefore W is a subcategory of weak equivalences in the sense of Definition 14.1.4. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 14.2.7. An object X of a model category M is cofibrant if the unique map ∅ −→ X is a cofibration. An acyclic fibration q : QX −→ X in which QX is cofibrant is called a cofibrant approximation or cofibrant replacement 5 of X. We can obtain q by factoring ∅ −→ X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 220</a>)</p>
Given two cofibrant replacements q : QX −→ X and q ′ : Q′ X −→ X, the lifting property gives a weak equivalence ξ : QX −→ Q′ X such that q ′ ◦ ξ = q (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 221</a>)</p>
In many model categories, either all objects are fibrant or all objects are cofibrant (but rarely both). For example, all objects are fibrant in the model structures that we shall define on U , and all objects are cofibrant in the usual model structure on simplicial sets (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 221</a>)</p>
For example, the following result becomes especially helpful when all objects are cofibrant or all objects are fibrant. Lemma 14.2.9 (Ken Brown’s lemma). Let F : M −→ N be a functor, where M is a model category and N is a category with a subcategory of weak equivalences. If F takes acyclic cofibrations between cofibrant objects to weak equivalences, then F takes all weak equivalences between cofibrant objects to weak equivalences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

in most examples there is a familiar and classical notion of a homotopy between maps. It is defined in terms of canonical cylinder and path objects, such as X × I and Map(I, X) in the case of spaces. Quillen [112] developed a notion of homotopy in general model categories and showed how to derive many familiar results using the model theoretic notion.

objects (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=222" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 222</a>)</p>
Definition 14.3.1. A cylinder object for X ∈ M is an object Cyl X together with maps i0 : X −→ Cyl X, i1 : X −→ Cyl X, and p : Cyl (X) −→ X such that p ◦ i0 = id = p ◦ i1 and p is a weak equivalence; by the two out of three property, i0 and i1 are also weak equivalences. A cylinder object is good if the map i = i0 + i1 : X ∐ X −→ Cyl (X) is a cofibration. A good cylinder object Cyl (X) is very good if p is an acyclic fibration. Factorization of the folding map X ∐ X −→ X shows that every X has at least one very good cylinder object. A left homotopy between maps f, g : X −→ Y is a map h : Cyl (X) −→ Y such that h ◦ i0 = f and (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Lemma 14.3.3. If h is a left homotopy from f to g and either f or g is a weak equivalence, then so is the other. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We emphasize that the definition of left homotopy allows the use of any cylinder object and that the notion of left homotopy and its good and very good variants are not equivalence relations in general (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Even in some categories with canonical cylinders, such as the category of simplicial sets, homotopy is not an equivalence relation in general (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

For example, in the standard model structure on topological spaces of §17.2, X × I is a cylinder object, but it is not good unless X is cofibrant, and similarly for categories of chain complexes.

Perhaps the real force of Quillen’s approach to homotopies is the comparison between left and right homotopies. Proposition 14.3.11. Consider maps f, g : X −→ Y . (i) If X is cofibrant and f is left homotopic to g, then f is right homotopic to g. (ii) If Y is fibrant and f is right homotopic to g, then f is left homotopic to g.

Definition 14.3.12. When X is cofibrant and Y is fibrant, we say that f is homotopic to g, written f ≃ g, if f is left or, equivalently, right homotopic to g.

Corollary 14.3.13. Let X be cofibrant and Y be fibrant. Fix a good cylinder object Cyl X and a good path object Cocyl Y .

Remark 14.3.16. We have used HELP and coHELP in several places, notably §3.3.

Definition 14.4.1. Consider the full categories Mc , Mf , and Mcf of cofibrant, fibrant, and bifibrant objects of M .

RY . Then we can obtain lifts Qf : QX −→ QY and Rf : RX −→ RY in the diagrams (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Thus we have a kind of point set level naturality of q and r even when we do not have functors Q and R (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 14.4.5. Define the homotopy category HoM to have objects the objects of M and morphism sets HoM (X, Y ) = hMcf (RQX, RQY ) = π(RQX, RQY ), with the evident composition.

The class of maps f such that γ(f ) is an isomorphism is precisely W , and every map in HoM is a composite of morphisms in γ(M ) and inverses of morphisms in γ(W ).

Theorem 14.4.8 (Whitehead). The following versions of the dual Whitehead theorems hold.

In any category C , a map f : A −→ B is an isomorphism if and only if either f∗ : C (C, A) −→ C (C, B) or f ∗ : C (B, C) −→ C (A, C) is an isomorphism for one C in each isomorphism class of objects in C .

It is important to understand when functors defined on M are homotopy invariant, in the sense that they take homotopic maps to the same map. There are three results along this line, the most obvious of which is the least useful. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Lemma 14.4.9. Any functor F : M −→ H that takes weak equivalences to isomorphisms identifies left or right homotopic maps. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

However, the hypothesis on F here is too strong and rarely holds in practice. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

There is a standard construction of WFS’s and model categories, which is based on Quillen’s “small object argument”. The latter is a general method for starting with a set, I say, of maps of M and constructing from I a functorial WFS ( (I  ), I  ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=231" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 231</a>)</p>
The small object argument is often repeated in the model category literature, but it admits a useful variant that we feel has not been sufficiently emphasized in print. 1 We call the variant the compact object argument (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=231" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 231</a>)</p>
In many basic examples, such as topological spaces, chain complexes, and simplicial sets, only sequential colimits are required. When this is the case, we obtain a more concrete type of cofibrantly generated model category called a compactly generated model category. In such cases we are free to ignore transfinite cell complexes. Compactly generated model categories are attractive to us since the relevant cell theory is much closer to classical cell theory in algebraic topology (e.g. [89]) and in homological algebra (e.g. [74]) than the transfinite version (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=231" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 231</a>)</p>
We feel that the general case of cofibrantly generated model categories is overemphasized in the model category literature, and we urge the reader not to get bogged down in the details of the requisite smallness condition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=231" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 231</a>)</p>
We describe model structures in over and under “slice categories” in §15.3. This gives a frequently used illustration of how one creates new model structures from given ones (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 231</a>)</p>
The essential starting point is to define I-cell complexes. When I is the set {S n −→ Dn+1 } of standard cell inclusions, all CW complexes will be examples of I-cell complexes as we define them (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=232" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 232</a>)</p>
Remark 15.1.12. There is a general property of a category, called local presentability [12, §5.2], that ensures that any set I permits the small object argument. In such categories, this leads to a more uniform and aesthetically satisfactory treatment of the small object argument. It is satisfied by most algebraically defined categories. It is not satisfied by the category of compactly generated topological spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=236" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 236</a>)</p>
However, if instead of using all compact Hausdorff spaces in the definition of compactly generated spaces [89, p. 37], one only uses standard simplices, one obtains the locally presentable category of “combinatorial spaces”. It appears that one can redo all of algebraic topology with combinatorial spaces replacing compactly generated spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 15.2.1. A model category M is cofibrantly generated if there are (small) sets I and J of maps such that C = C (I) and C ∩W = C (J ) and therefore F = J  and F ∩W = I  . The sets I and J are called the generating cofibrations and generating acyclic cofibrations. We say that M is compactly generated if, further, I and J are compact, in which case only ordinary sequential cell complexes are needed to define C (I) and C (J ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Remark 15.2.2. A combinatorial model category is a locally presentable category that is also a cofibrantly generated model category [9]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 236</a>)</p>
For example, Theorem 15.2.3 is often used to transport a model structure across an adjunction, as we formalize in Theorem 16.2.5 below, and then only the acyclicity condition need be verified (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=237" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 237</a>)</p>
The acyclicity condition clearly holds if J ⊂ W and W is a left saturated class of maps in the sense of Definition 14.1.7. This rarely applies since pushouts of weak equivalences are generally not weak equivalences. However, pushouts of coproducts of maps in J often are weak equivalences, and verifying that is usually the key step in verifying the acyclicity condition.

Definition 15.3.1. Let M be a category and B be an object of M . The slice category B/M of objects under B has objects the maps i = iX : B −→ X in M and morphisms the maps f : X −→ Y such that f ◦ iX = iY (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 15.4.1. A model category M is left proper if the pushout of a weak equivalence along a cofibration is a weak equivalence.

The following concept will play a significant role in our discussion of Bousfield localization in Chapter 19, and it is important throughout model category theory.

Over and under model structures often play a helpful technical role in proofs, as is well illustrated by their use in the proof of the following result. One point is that appropriate maps can be viewed as cofibrant or fibrant objects in model categories, allowing us to apply results about such objects to maps.

Proposition 15.4.2. Let M be a model category. Then any pushout of a weak equivalence between cofibrant objects along a cofibration is a weak equivalence, hence M is left proper if every object of M is cofibrant (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 15.4.3. A model category M satisfies the left gluing lemma if, for any commutative diagram A f C i o g k /B h A ′ o C ′ j o ℓ B′ in which i and j are cofibrations and f , g, and h are weak equivalences, the induced map of pushouts A ∪C B −→ A ′ ∪C ′ B ′ is a weak equivalence.

Proposition 15.4.4. A model category M is left or right proper if and only if it satisfies the left or right gluing lemma (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In our examples, we sometimes prove the gluing lemma directly, because it is no more difficult. However, in deeper examples it is often easier to check that the model structure is left proper and to use the previous result to deduce that the left gluing lemma holds (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let i : A −→ X be a map in M and Z be an object of M . Consider the induced map (15.5.1) i ∗ : [X, Z] −→ [A, Z] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

of hom sets in HoM . We describe how we can sometimes deduce that i ∗ is a bijection directly from lifting properties and, conversely, how we can sometimes deduce lifting properties when i ∗ is a bijection. While i will be a cofibration and Z will be fibrant, the force of these results comes from the fact that the relevant lifting properties concern pairs of maps, neither of which need be a weak equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

we describe the 2-categorical way of understanding the passage to derived homotopy categories and we explain that double categories, rather than categories or 2-categories, give the appropriate conceptual framework for understanding maps between model categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

One small point that deserves more emphasis than it receives in the literature is that there is a familiar classical notion of homotopy in the enriched categories that appear in nature, and the model categorical notion of homotopy and the classical notion of homotopy can be used interchangably in such contexts. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Having defined model categories, we want next to define functors and natural transformations between them in such a way that they give “derived” functors and natural transformations on passage to their derived homotopy categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We say that a functor F : M −→ N between categories with weak equivalences is homotopical if it takes weak equivalences to weak equivalences, and we say that a functor F : M −→ HoN or more generally a functor F : M −→ H for any other category H is homotopical if it takes weak equivalences to isomorphisms. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

. The universal property of localization then gives a functor ̃ F̃ : HoM −→ HoN in the first case or ̃ F̃ : HoM −→ H in the general case (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=247" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 247</a>)</p>
The functor ̃ F̃ is a derived functor of F . However, this will not suffice for the applications. As we have already said, most functors F that we encounter are not homotopical, and then it is too much to expect that diagrams such as those above commute; rather, we often obtain diagrams like these that commute up to a natural transformation that is characterized by a universal property (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 248</a>)</p>
We note parenthetically that there are also functors that in some sense deserve the name of a derived functor and yet are neither left nor right derived in the sense we are about to define. The theory of such functors is not well understood, but they appear in applications (e.g. [93]) and have been given a formal description in [124]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

A left derived functor of a functor F : M −→ H is a functor LF : HoM −→ H together with a natural transformation µ : LF ◦ γ −→ F such that for any functor K : HoM −→ H and natural transformation ξ : K ◦γ −→ F , there is a unique natural transformation σ : K −→ LF such that the composite µ ◦ (σ · γ) : K ◦ γ −→ LF ◦ γ −→ F coincides with ξ. That is, (LF, µ) is terminal among pairs (K, ξ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We use · to denote the composite of a natural transformation and a functor; categorically, that is often called whiskering (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Since left derived functors are characterized by a universal property, they are unique up to canonical isomorphism if they exist. Confusingly, they are examples of what are known categorically as right Kan extensions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 16.1.3. If F : M −→ H takes acyclic cofibrations between cofibrant objects to isomorphisms, then the left derived functor (LF, µ) exists. Moreover, for any cofibrant object X of M , µ : LF X −→ F X is an isomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 16.2.1. Let F : M −→ N and U : N −→ M be left and right adjoint. The pair (F, U ) is a Quillen adjunction if the following equivalent conditions are satisfied.

Ponto 251</a>)</p>
The Quillen adjunction (F, U ) is a Quillen equivalence if for any map f : F X −→ Y with adjoint g : X −→ U Y , where X is cofibrant and Y is fibrant, f is a weak equivalence in N if and only if g is a weak equivalence in M .

Many of the applications concern adjunctions (F, U ) where F specifies free structured objects (such as monoids, algebras, etc) and U forgets the structure on these objects.

Proposition 16.2.2. If (F, U ) is a Quillen adjunction, then the total derived functors LF and RU exist and form an adjoint pair. If (F, U ) is a Quillen equivalence, then (LF, RU ) is an adjoint equivalence between HoM and HoN . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 251</a>)</p>
The criterion of Proposition 16.2.3(v) is especially useful since a standard way to build a model category structure on N is to use an adjunction (F, U ) to create it from a model structure on M , setting WN = U −1 (WM ) and FN = U −1 (FM ). The following result, which is [63, 11.3.2], is frequently used for this purpose. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

More deeply, it masks one of the greatest difficulties of model category theory and of the theory of derived functors in general. Good properties of left adjoints are preserved under composition of left adjoints. However, it is in practice very often necessary to compose left adjoints with right adjoints. Results about such composites are hard to come by. They are often truly deep mathematics. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

However, the categorical considerations of greatest relevance to the applications of model category theory concern enrichment from hom sets to hom objects (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A monoidal structure on a category V is a product, ⊗ say, and a unit object I such that the product is associative and unital up to coherent natural isomorphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Informally, coherence means that diagrams that intuitively should commute do in fact commute. (The symmetry coherence admits a weakening that gives braided monoidal categories, but those will not concern us.) A symmetric monoidal category V is closed if it has internal hom objects V (X, Y ) in V together with adjunction isomorphisms V (X ⊗ Y, Z) ∼ = ∼ = V (X, V (Y, Z)). These isomorphisms of hom sets imply isomorphisms of internal hom objects in V V (X ⊗ Y, Z) ∼ = ∼ = V (X, V (Y, Z)). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

From now on, we let V be a bicomplete closed symmetric monoidal category. Such categories appear so often in nature that category theorists have invented a name for them: such a category is often called a “cosmos”. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

When ⊗ is the cartesian product, we say that V is cartesian closed, but the same category V can admit other symmetric monoidal structures (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

(i) The category Set of sets is closed cartesian monoidal. (ii) The category U of (compactly generated) spaces is cartesian closed. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The category U∗ of based spaces is closed symmetric monoidal under the smash product. The smash product would not be associative if we used just spaces, rather than compactly generated spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The category sSet of simplicial sets is cartesian closed. A simplicial set is a contravariant functor ∆ −→ Set, where ∆ is the category of sets n = {0, 1, · · · , n} and monotonic maps. There are n-simplices ∆[n] in sSet, and n 7→ ∆[n] gives a covariant functor ∆ −→ sSet (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

For a commutative ring R, the category MR of R-modules is closed symmetric monoidal under the functors ⊗R and HomR ; in particular, the category Ab of abelian groups is closed symmetric monoidal (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For a commutative ring R, the category ChR of Z-graded chain complexes of R-modules (with differential lowering degree) is closed symmetric monoidal under the graded tensor product and hom functors (X ⊗R Y )n = Σp+q=n Xp ⊗R Yq ; d(x ⊗ y) = d(x) ⊗ y + (−1) p x ⊗ d(y). HomR (X, Y )n = Πi HomR (Xi , Yi+n ); d(f )i = d ◦ fi − (−1) n fi−1 ◦ d. Here the symmetry γ : X ⊗ Y −→ Y ⊗ X is defined with a sign, γ(x ⊗ y) = (−1) pq y ⊗ x for x ∈ Xp and y ∈ Yq .

The category Cat of small categories is cartesian closed (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 16.3.3. Let V be a symmetric monoidal category. A V -category M , or a category M enriched over V , consists of (i) a class of objects, with typical objects denoted X, Y , Z; (ii) for each pair of objects (X, Y ), a hom object M (X, Y ) in V ; (iii) for each object X, a unit map idX : I −→ M (X, X) in V ; (iv) for each triple of objects (X, Y, Z), a composition morphism in V M (Y, Z) ⊗ M (X, Y ) −→ M (X, Z).

Categories as usually defined are categories enriched in Set. (ii) Categories enriched in Ab are called Ab-categories. They are called additive categories if they have zero objects and biproducts [77, p. 196]. They are called abelian categories if, further, all maps have kernels and cokernels, every monomorphism is a kernel, and every epimorphism is a cokernel (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

(iii) Categories enriched in U are called topological categories. (iv) Categories enriched in sSet are called simplicial categories. (v) Categories enriched in ChR for some R are called DG-categories. (vi) Categories enriched in Cat are called (strict) 2-categories and, inductively, categories enriched in the cartesian monoidal category of (n − 1)-categories are called (strict) n-categories.

For any ring R, not necessarily commutative, the category of left R-modules is abelian (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Most of the model category literature focuses on simplicial categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

However, there are important enriched categorical notions that take account of the extra structure given by the enrichment and are not just reinterpretations of ordinary categorical notions. In particular, there are weighted (or indexed) colimits and limits. The most important of these (in non-standard notation) are tensors X ⊙V (sometimes called copowers) and cotensors (sometimes called powers) Φ(V, X) in M for objects X ∈ M and V ∈ V . These are characterized by natural isomorphisms (16.3.6) M (X ⊙ V, Y ) ∼ = ∼ = V (V, M (X, Y )) ∼ = ∼ = M (X, Φ(V, Y )) of hom sets. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The functor V (I, −) is a right adjoint and therefore preserves limits, such as pullbacks; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We have defined categories enriched in a symmetric monoidal category V , and we have observed that one such V is the cartesian monoidal category Cat, the category of categories and functors (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 262</a>)</p>
We have also observed that a category enriched in Cat is called a 2-category. An example is Cat itself. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 262</a>)</p>
We think of functors as morphisms between categories and natural transformations as morphisms between functors. We also have two 2-categories ModCatℓ and ModCatr of model categories. Their objects (or 0-cells) are model categories, their morphisms (or 1-cells) are Quillen left adjoints and Quillen right adjoints, respectively, and their morphisms between morphisms (or 2-cells) are natural transformations in both cases. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

A pseudo-functor F : C −→ D between 2-categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

assigns 0-cells, 1-cells, and 2-cells in D to 0-cells, 1-cells, and 2-cells in C . For each fixed pair X, Y of 0-cells, F specifies a functor C (X, Y ) −→ D(FX, FY ). However, for 0-cells X, F(IdX ) need not equal IdFX and, for composable 1-cells F and G, F(G ◦ F ) need not equal FG ◦ FF . Rather, there are 2-cell isomorphisms connecting these. These isomorphisms are subject to coherence axioms asserting that certain associativity and left and right unity diagrams commute (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 16.5.1. Passage from model categories to their derived homotopy categories HoM , derived functors, and derived natural transformations specify pseudo-functors L : ModCatℓ −→ Cat and R : ModCatr −→ Cat.

The proper framework is given by viewing model categories as forming not a pair of 2-categories, but rather as a single double category (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Just as we can define a category enriched in any symmetric monoidal category V , we can define an internal category in any complete category V . It has object and morphism objects Ob and Mor in V together with maps S, T : Mor −→ Ob, I : Ob −→ Mor, and C : Mor ×Ob Mor −→ Mor in V , called source, target, identity, and composition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 263</a>)</p>
An ordinary category is an internal category in the category of sets. Internal categories in the category U of topological spaces appear frequently. A double category is just an internal category in Cat. A 2-category can be viewed as a double category whose object category is discrete, meaning that it has only identity morphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 263</a>)</p>
It has 0-cells, namely the objects of the category Ob, it has both “vertical” and “horizontal” 1-cells, namely the morphisms of Ob and the objects of Mor, and it has 2-cells, namely the morphisms of Mor.

Ponto 263</a>)</p>
Thus let M be a category with a subcategory W of weak equivalences. We form a double category D(M , W ) whose objects are the objects of M , whose horizontal and vertical 1-cells are the morphisms of M and of W , and whose 2-cells are commutative diagrams X f v Y w  X ′ g / Y′ in which v, w ∈ W . Thinking in terms of the arrow category of M , we can view this square as a morphism v −→ w between vertical arrows or as a morphism f −→ g between horizontal arrows.

Ponto 264</a>)</p>
The reason for introducing this language is that it gives a way of expressing L and R as part of a single kind of functor, namely a double pseudofunctor F : D −→ E between double categories. Such an F assigns 0-cells, vertical 1-cells, horizontal 1-cells, and 2-cells in D to the corresponding kinds of cells in C . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Corollary 16.5.4. If F is both a Quillen left adjoint and a Quillen right adjoint, then LF ∼ = ∼ RF . = The real force of Theorem 16.5.3 concerns the comparisons it induces between composites of left and right derived adjoint base change functors (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem 16.5.3. Model categories are the 0-cells of a double category Mod whose vertical and horizontal 1-cells are the Quillen left and right adjoints and whose 2-cells are the natural transformations. There is a double pseudofunctor F : Mod −→ Q(Cat) such that Fv = L and Fh = R. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 264</a>)</p>
This result encodes many relationships between left and right Quillen adjoints in a form that is familiar in other categorical contexts. The Quillen adjunctions (F, U ) are examples of the correct categorical notion of an adjunction in a double category, called a conjunction in (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 264</a>)</p>
The central point we want to make is that there are three intertwined model structures on the relevant categories, and that the least familiar, which is called the mixed model structure and was introduced relatively recently by Michael Cole [31], is in some respects the most convenient (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In fact, we shall argue that algebraic topologists, from the very beginning of the subject, have by preference worked implicitly in the mixed model structure on topological spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The most obvious homotopical notion of a weak equivalence is an actual homotopy equivalence. We call such maps h-equivalences for short. It is natural to expect there to be a model category structure on the category U of compactly generated spaces in which the weak equivalences are the h-equivalences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The cofibrations are the maps i : A −→ X that satisfy the homotopy extension property (HEP) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The fibrations are the maps p : E −→ B that satisfy the covering homotopy property (CHP). This means that for all spaces A they satisfy the RLP with respect to the inclusion i0 : A −→ A × I.

call these Hurewicz cofibrations and Hurewicz fibrations, conveniently abbreviated to h-cofibrations and h-fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

These cofibrations and fibrations were not considered by Quillen in his paper introducing model categories [112], but Strøm [128] later proved a version of the following result. Technically, he worked in the category of all spaces, not just the compactly generated ones, and in that category the model theoretic cofibrations are the Hurewicz cofibrations that are closed inclusions. However, as we left as an exercise in [89, p. 46], the Hurewicz cofibrations in U are closed inclusions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 17.1.1 (h-model structure). The category U is a monoidal model category whose weak equivalences, cofibrations, and fibrations, denoted (Wh , Ch , Fh ), are the h-equivalences, h-cofibrations, and h-fibrations. All spaces are both h-fibrant and h-cofibrant, hence this model structure is proper (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Corollary 17.1.2. The category U∗ of based spaces in U is a proper model category whose weak equivalences, cofibrations, and fibrations are the based maps that are h-equivalences, h-cofibrations, and h-fibrations when regarded as maps in U . The pair (T, U ), where T is given by adjoining disjoint basepoints and U is the forgetful functor, is a Quillen adjunction relating U to U∗ . Moreover, U∗ is a monoidal model category with respect to the smash product. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remark 17.1.3. In the first half of the book, we worked thoughout in the category T of nondegenerately based spaces in U .

In the first half of the book, we assumed that all spaces had the homotopy types of CW-complexes. Therefore there was no distinction between a homotopy equivalence and a weak homotopy equivalence.

Note that the most natural kind of based cell complexes would start with based cells S n −→ Dn+1 for chosen basepoints of spheres and would have based attaching maps. While such cell complexes are useful, they can only model connected based spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

When we specialize to spaces, the statements in the rest of the section give model theoretic refinements of classical results, and the reader may wish to skip to the next section, referring back to this one as needed. For example, the first part of the following result refines the Whitehead theorem that a weak equivalence between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Therefore the category of CW homotopy types in T used in the first half of this book is the full subcategory of the category U∗ whose objects are the mcofibrant based spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It has long been accepted that the q-equivalences give the definitively right weak equivalences for classical homotopy theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The fibrations most frequently used in practice are the Hurewicz fibrations rather than the Serre fibrations. There are good reasons for this. For example, Hurewicz fibrations, but not Serre fibrations, are determined locally, in the sense of the following result (e.g. [84, 3.8]). It generalizes a theorem of Hurewicz [67]. Theorem 17.4.4. Let p : E −→ B be a surjective map and assume that B has a numerable open cover {U } such that each restriction p−1 U −→ U is an h-fibration. Then p is an h-fibration. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 278</a>)</p>
The proof uses the characterization of h-fibrations in terms of path lifting functions [89, §7.2], and that characterization itself often gives an easy way of checking that a map is an h-fibration. Paradoxically, this means that it is often easiest to prove that a map is a q-fibration by proving the stronger statement that it is an h-fibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=278" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 278</a>)</p>
These considerations argue for the h-fibrations, Fh , as our preferred subcategory of fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The mixed model structure has all of the good formal properties of the q-model structure. It is almost certainly not cofibrantly generated, but that is irrelevant to the applications (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Any map with the name cofibration should at least be a classical Hurewicz cofibration, and an m-cofibration is an h-cofibration that is a q-cofibration up to homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition 17.3.4(i) generalizes the relative version of the Whitehead theorem that a weak equivalence between cell complexes is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Cell complexes are more general than CW complexes, but any cell complex is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. Therefore, in the mixed model structure, we can use cell and CW complexes interchangeably (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=279" target="_blank">J. P. May & K.

One is to first approximate any space X by a weakly equivalent CW complex, (e.g. [89, §10.5]), and then use the Whitehead theorem (e.g. [89, §10.3]) to show that any cell approximation of X is homotopy equivalent to the constructed CW approximation. The other is to inductively deform any given cell complex to a homotopy equivalent CW complex by cellular approximation of its attaching maps. The geometric realization of the total singular complex of X gives a particularly nice functorial CW approximation (e.g. [89, §16.2]), and it is a functorial cofibrant approximation in both the q and the m-model structures. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 279</a>)</p>
A central reason for preferring the m to the q-model structure is that it is generally quite hard to check whether or not a given space is actually homeomorphic to a cell or CW complex, whereas there are powerful classical theorems that characterize spaces of the homotopy types of CW complexes. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

For an elementary example of this, there are many contractible spaces that cannot be homeomorphic to cell complexes; cones on badly behaved spaces give examples (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Although the standard model structure on simplicial sets is very convenient and useful, the proofs that it is indeed a model structure are notoriously involved (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The senior author has long believed that simpler proofs should be possible (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In retrospect, each gives a fibrant replacement functor on simplicial sets with unusually nice properties: both of these functors preserve fibrations and finite limits. Our proof of the model axioms requires use of these properties, but it is irrelevant which of the functors we use. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Our starting point is the following definition, part (iii) of which is not but ought to be the standard definition of a weak equivalence of simplicial sets (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 17.5.1. Let f : X −→ Y be a map of simplicial sets. (i) f is a cofibration if the map fq : Xq −→ Yq of q-simplices is an injection for each q; equivalently, f is a categorical monomorphism. In particular, every simplicial set is cofibrant. (ii) f is a fibration if it is a Kan fibration. This means that f satisfies the RLP with respect to all horns Λ k [n] −→ ∆[n]. In particular, the fibrant objects are the Kan complexes. (iii) f is a weak equivalence if f ∗ : π(Y, Z) −→ π(X, Z) is a bijection for all Kan complexes Z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Let (T, S) denote the adjoint pair between S and U given by geometric realization and the total singular complex; T X is usually denoted |X|, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 280</a>)</p>
Note that in contrast with spaces, homotopy groups do not enter into the definition of weak equivalences. One reason is that they are not easily defined for general simplicial sets. However, they admit a direct combinatorial definition for Kan complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=280" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 280</a>)</p>
The equivalence of (ii) and (iii) is formal. Since the Kan complexes are the bifibrant objects in S , this result should be viewed as the simplicial analogue of the Whitehead theorem that a weak equivalence between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma 17.5.5. The functor S takes spaces to Kan complexes, takes Serre fibrations to Kan fibrations, and preserves limits (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Lemma 17.5.6. The functor T preserves finite limits, hence so does the composite functor ST . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 17.5.10. For a Kan complex X, the unit η : X −→ ST X of the adjunction is a combinatorial weak equivalence and therefore a homotopy equivalence. Corollary 17.5.11. For a space Y , the counit ε : T SY −→ Y of the adjunction is a q-equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proof. As with any adjunction, the composite SY η / ST SY Sε SY is the identity map (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Corollary 17.5.13. For any simplicial set X, the unit η : X −→ ST X is a weak equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 17.5.12 means that the left adjoint T creates the weak equivalences in S . In most other adjoint pair situations, it is the right adjoint that creates the weak equivalences. The difference is central to the relative difficulty in proving the model category axioms in S . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

As a left adjoint, T preserves all colimits (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=284" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 284</a>)</p>
Remark 17.6.7. There is no h-model structure on simplicial sets in the literature, and it does not seem sensible to try to define one. One point is just that the unit interval simplicial set I = ∆[1] is asymmetric and the obvious notion of homotopy is not an equivalence relation. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Again, as in topology, we believe that the m-model structure is central and deserves much more attention than it has received in the literature (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The category ChR is bicomplete. Limits and colimits in ChR are just limits and colimits of the underlying R-modules, constructed degreewise, with the naturally induced differentials. Here we use the term R-module for a graded R-module, without differentials (or with differential identically zero). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Recall from §16.3 that a cosmos is a bicomplete closed symmetric monoidal category. The category ChZ is a cosmos under ⊗ and Hom (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 289</a>)</p>
The category ChR is enriched, tensored and cotensored over ChZ . The chain complex of morphisms X −→ Y is HomR (X, Y ), where HomR (X, Y ) is the subcomplex of Hom(X, Y ) consisting of those maps f that are maps of underlying R-modules. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 289</a>)</p>
Observe that since the zero module 0 is both an initial and terminal object in ChR , the analogy to make is with based rather than unbased spaces. For n ∈ Z, we define S n , the n-sphere chain complex, to be Z concentrated in degree n with zero differential. For any integer n, we define the n-fold suspension Σn X of an R-chain complex X to be X ⊗ S n . Thus (Σn X)n+q ∼ = Xq . The notation is motivated by the observation that if we define πn (X) to be the abelian group of chain homotopy classes of maps S n −→ X (ignoring the R-module structure), then πn (X) = Hn (X). The motto is that homology is a special case of homotopy and that homological algebra is a special case of homotopical algebra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We used the notations ⊙ and Φ for tensors and cotensors earlier, but we will use ⊗ and Hom here, where these again mean ⊗Z and HomZ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Analogously, we define D n+1 to be the (n + 1)-disk chain complex. It is Z in degrees n and n + 1 and zero in all other degrees. There is only one differential that can be non-zero, and we choose that differential to be the identity map Z −→ Z. The copy of Z in degree n is identified with S n and is quite literally the boundary of Dn+1 . We agree to write SR n R n+1 = R ⊗ S n and DR R = R ⊗ Dn+1 .

We define I to be the cellular chains of the unit interval. It is the chain complex with one basis element [I] in degree 1, two basis elements [0] and [1] in degrees 0, and differential d([I]) = [0] − [1]. We define a homotopy f ≃ g between maps of R-chain complexes X −→ Y to be a map of R-chain complexes h : X ⊗ I −→ Y that restricts to f and g on X ⊗ [0] and Y ⊗ [1].

In ChR , coproducts are direct sums and the pushout of maps f : A −→ X and g : A −→ Y is the “difference cokernel” (X ⊕ Y )/Im(f − g). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We have two natural categories of weak equivalences in ChR . The h-equivalences are the homotopy equivalences of R-chain complexes, and the q-equivalences are the quasi-isomorphisms, namely those maps of R-chain complexes that induce an isomorphism on passage to the homology of the underlying chain complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We let hChR denote the ordinary homotopy category of ChR and call it the classical homotopy category of ChR .

Definition 18.2.1. An h-cofibration is a map i : A −→ X in ChR that satisfies the homotopy extension property (HEP).

An h-fibration is a map p : E −→ B that satisfies the covering homotopy property (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Consider the category A/ChR of chain complexes under a chain complex R. Let X and Y be R-chain complexes under A, with given maps i : A −→ X and j : A −→ Y . Two maps f, g : X −→ Y under A are said to be homotopic under A, or relative to A, if there is a homotopy h : X ⊗ I −→ Y between them such that h(a ⊗ [I]) = 0 for a ∈ A. That is, h restricts on A ⊗ I to the algebraic version of the constant homotopy at j. A cofiber homotopy equivalence is a homotopy equivalence under A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

more sophisticated algebraic situations, there are h, r, and q-model structures, and they are all different. This happens, for example, if R is a commutative ring, A is a DG R-algebra, and we consider model structures on the category of differential graded A-modules 2 . In this situation, A need not be projective as an R-module, and then functors such as ⊗A and HomA rarely preserve exact sequences. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Relative homological algebra rectifies this by restricting the underlying notion of an exact sequence of A-modules to sequences that are degreewise split exact as sequences of graded R-modules (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Of course, such splittings are given by maps of underlying graded R-modules which need not be maps of chain complexes. The following result (due to Cole [30]) shows that the splittings can be deformed to chain maps if the given R-split maps are homotopy equivalences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In topology, cellular approximation of maps allows us to replace cell complexes by equivalent CW complexes. In algebra, the comparison is much simpler and the difference is negligible since an “attaching n map” SR R −→ Fq X for a cell D n+1 R necessarily has image in the elements (Fq X)n of degree n. When we restrict attention to those X such that Xq = 0 for q < 0, as in classical projective resolutions, we may as well also restrict attention to those I-cell complexes such that Fq X = X≤q (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This gives X a second filtration that corresponds to the skeletal filtration of CW complexes in topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

An I-cell complex X has an increasing filtration given by its successive terms, which we shall here denote by Fq X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Of course, regarding an ungraded R-module M as a DG R-module concentrated in degree 0, a q-cofibrant approximation of M is exactly a projective resolution of M .

Remark 18.5.5. Hovey [66] has studied abelian categories with model structures in which the cofibrations are the monomorphisms with cofibrant cokernel and the fibrations are the epimorphisms with fibrant kernel.

The mixed model structure has all of the good formal properties of the q-model structure. It is proper, it is monoidal when R is commutative, and it is an ChZ -model structure in general. The identity functor on ChR is a right Quillen equivalence from the m-model structure to the q-model structure and therefore a left Quillen equivalence from the q-model structure to the m-model structure. The class Cm of m-cofibrations is very well-behaved (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Homotopy invariant constructions that start with complexes of projective R-modules automatically give m-cofibrant objects, but not necessarily degreewise projective objects. In particular, it is very often useful to study the perfect complexes, namely the objects of ChR that are homotopy equivalent to bounded complexes of finitely generated projective R-modules. These are the dualizable objects of HoChR (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

From the point of view of classical homological algebra, it is interesting to think of projective resolutions homotopically as analogues of approximation by CW complexes, well-defined only up to homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Of course, using either a q-cofibrant or m-cofibrant approximation P of an R-module M , regarded as a chain complex concentrated in degree 0, we have Tor R ∗ (N, M ) = H∗ (N ⊗R P ) and Ext∗ R (M, N ) = H ∗ HomR (P, N ), the latter regraded cohomologically. We can think of these as obtained by first applying the derived functors of N ⊗R (−) and HomR (−, N ) and then taking homology n groups or, equivalently, thinking in terms of spheres SR R , homotopy groups.

Indeed, this gives a new perspective on the construction of the homotopy category HoU of spaces from the naive homotopy category hU obtained by identifying homotopic maps and of the derived homotopy category HoChR of chain complexes from the naive homotopy category hChR .

Localization model structures codify Bousfield localization, which vastly generalizes the constructions in the first half of this book (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

There we concentrated on arithmetic localizations and completions that are closely related to standard algebraic constructions. We restricted our constructions to nilpotent spaces since that is the natural range of applicability of our elementary methodology and since most applications focus on such spaces. There are several different ways to generalize to non-nilpotent spaces, none of them well understood calculationally. Bousfield localization gives a general conceptual understanding of the most widely used of these, and it gives the proper perspective for generalizations to categories other than the category of spaces and (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In modern algebraic topology, especially in stable homotopy theory, Bousfield localizations at generalized homology theories play a fundamental role. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We are thinking of the weak homotopy equivalences in U and the quasi-isomorphisms in ChR (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

since we are thinking of actual homotopy equivalences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

As will become clear, the resolvant objects in U are the spaces of the homotopy types of CW complexes, and this codifies the Whitehead theorem for such spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Similarly, the (bounded below) resolvant objects in ChR are the chain complexes that are of the homotopy type of chain complexes of projective modules, and this codifies the analogous Whitehead theorem for such chain complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Writing “up to homotopy” to mean “in HoM ”, if f : D −→ X is any map from a resolvant object D to X, there is a map f ˜ f˜, unique up to homotopy, such that the following diagram commutes up to homotopy (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 19.2.2. For spaces X and a homology theory E∗ on spaces, say that ξ : X −→ Y is an E-equivalence if it induces an isomorphism E∗ (X) −→ E∗ (Y ) and let LE denote the class of E-equivalences. Say that a space Z is E-local if it is LE -local. Say that a map φ : X −→ XE from X into an E-local space XE is a localization at E if φ is an E-equivalence. Example 19.2.3. When E∗ (X) = H∗ (X; ZT ), these definitions agree up to nomenclature with our definition of localization at T in §5.2. Similarly, when E∗ (X) = H∗ (X; FT ), where FT = ×p∈T Fp , these definitions agree up to nomenclature with our definition of completion at T (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Observe that the names “localization” and “completion” that are carried over from algebra in the earlier parts of the book are really the names of two examples of a generalized notion of localization (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

the essential idea of Bousfield localization is to try to construct a model structure on M of the form (L , C , FL ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

As an historical aside, Bousfield’s original treatment [15] first introduced the methods of transfinite induction into model category theory, and only later were his ideas codified into the notion of a cofibrantly generated model structure (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Little is known about the behavior on homotopy groups of localizations and completions of non-nilpotent spaces. Of course, for generalized homology theories E∗ , no such concrete descriptions can be expected, even for nilpotent spaces. The determination of the homotopy groups of particular E-localizations of spectra is a major part of stable homotopy theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

already for S 1 ∨ S n , the Bousfield-Kan completion at p does not induce an isomorphism on mod p homology.

As usual, we let F (X, Y ) denote the function space of based maps X −→ Y and let X+ denote the union of an unbased space X and a disjoint basepoint (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

More recently, Jeff Smith (unpublished) has proven that the f -localization model structure exists for any map f in any left proper combinatorial simplicial model category.

There is an extensive literature on f -localizations for a map f . The first existence proof is due to Bousfield [16], and the books [52, 63] study the foundations in detail. These sources work with simplicial sets. Dror Fajoun’s monograph [38] gives several variant existence proofs, and he explains how either simplicial sets or topological spaces can be used. His monograph analyzes many interesting examples in detail. Bousfield [18] gives a nice overview of this area, with many references. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remark 19.5.6. One can ask whether or not localizations at classes, rather than sets, of maps always exist. Remarkably, Casacuberta, Scevenels, and Smith [25] prove that this holds if Vopěnka’s principle (a certain large cardinal axiom) is valid, but that it cannot be proven using only the usual ZFC axioms of set theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We end our discussion of model categories and localization with a philosophical remark that contains a puzzling and interesting open problem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In particular, in the categories of spaces or chain complexes, we have the qmodel structure and the m-model structure with the same weak equivalences and therefore with equivalent homotopy categories. In these cases, all objects are fibrant and so the definition of L -local objects is the same in the two cases. However, the question of the existence of the L -model structure is still model dependent. Clearly, asking whether or not (L , C , FL ) is a model structure is a different question for (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remark 19.5.7. The notion of localizing a category M , or a homotopy category HoM , at a subcategory L of weak equivalences makes sense as a general matter of homotopical algebra, independent of model category theory. However, the general theory here depends on the chosen model structure since we have required L -local objects to be fibrant in a given model structure on M . Thus our definition of an L -local object really defines the notion of being L -local relative to a given model structure. For a fixed ambient category of weak equivalences W , there may be several model structures (W , C , F ) on M with different good properties (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 320</a>)</p>
The known existence proofs for L -local (or K -local) model structures on spaces start from the q-model structure. We actually do not know whether or not (L , Cm , Fℓ ) is a model structure even when we do know that (L , Cq , Fℓ ) is a model structure. We regard this as a quite unsatisfactory state of affairs, but we leave the existence of model structures (L , Cm , Fℓ ) as an open problem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

C = Cq and for C = Cm . Of course, FL depends on which choice we make, even though the fibrant objects are the same with both choices (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Thus the familiar concepts of algebra and module dualize to concepts of coalgebra and comodule, and the structures of algebra and coalgebra combine to give the notion of a bialgebra. Incorporating antipodes (sometimes called conjugations), we obtain the notion of a Hopf algebra. In the cocommutative case, bialgebras and Hopf algebras can be viewed as monoids and groups in the symmetric monoidal category of cocommutative coalgebras (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In categorical language, the category MR of graded R-modules is symmetric monoidal, and it is closed in the sense that there is a natural isomorphism Hom(A ⊗ B, C) ∼ = ∼ = Hom(A, Hom(B, C)); it sends f to g, where g(a)(b) = f (a ⊗ b) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We say that A is projective if each Ai is projective (over R), and we say that A is of finite type if each Ai is finitely generated (over R). We say that A is bounded if it is non-zero in only finitely many degrees. Thus A is finitely generated if and only if it is bounded and of finite type. We say that A is bounded below (or above) if Ai = 0 for i sufficiently small (or large). Then ν is an isomorphism if A is bounded and either A or C is projective of finite type, ρ is an isomorphism if A is projective of finite type, and the last map α is an isomorphism if A and B are bounded below and A or B is projective of finite type (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

That is, φ is a morphism of coalgebras or, equivalently, ψ is a morphism of algebras.

Let C be a unital coalgebra. Define the R-module P C of primitive elements of C by the exact sequence 0 / PC / JC ψ / JC ⊗ JC. Let IC = ker ε. We say that x ∈ IC is primitive if its image in JC lies in P C. Note that P C is well-defined even if C is not coassociative (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 20.2.8. Let A be a quasi bialgebra. Define ν : P A → QA to be the composite PA / JA ∼ = IA / QA (or, equivalently, the restriction of IA → QA to P A if P A is regarded as contained in A).

In the first case, that is a familiar fact from classical algebra since the intersection of the powers of a (two-sided) ideal in a ring can be non-zero [6, p. 110].

For a monoid G, the monoid ring R[G] is a bialgebra with product, coproduct, unit and counit induced by the product, diagonal, identity element, and trivial function G −→ {pt}. If G is a group, its inverse function induces an antipode on R[G], in the sense of the following definition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 20.3.1. An antipode χ on a bialgebra A is a map χ : A → A of R-modules such that the following diagrams commute.

. Historically, the concept of Hopf algebra originated in algebraic topology, where the term “Hopf algebra” was used for what we are calling a bialgebra (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=332" target="_blank">J. P. May & K.

the bialgebras that usually appear in algebraic topology automatically have antipodes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 332</a>)</p>
We have followed the algebraic literature in using the name antipode and distinguishing between bialgebras and Hopf algebras because of the more recent interest in Hopf algebras of a kind that do not seem to appear in algebraic topology, such as quantum groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It is a standard and easy observation that the tensor product is the categorical coproduct in the category of commutative algebras (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Recall that, in any category with products, we have the notion of a monoid, namely an object with an associative and unital product, and of a group, namely a monoid with an antipode.

Proposition 20.3.4. The tensor product is the categorical product in the category C of commutative coalgebras. A cocommutative bialgebra is a monoid in C , and a cocommutative Hopf algebra is a group in C . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Construction 20.3.5. Let C be a coalgebra and A be an algebra. Then Hom(C, A) is an algebra, called a convolution algebra. Its unit element is the composite C ε ε − →R η − → A and its product is the composite ∗ : Hom(C, A) ⊗ Hom(C, A) α α − → Hom(C ⊗ C, A ⊗ A) Hom(ψ,φ) −−−−−−→ Hom(C, A).

Ponto 332</a>)</p>
If C is unital with unit η and A is augmented with augmentation ε, then the set G(C, A) of maps of R-modules f : C −→ A such that f η = η and εf = ε is a submonoid of Hom(C, A) under the convolution product ∗.

Remark 20.3.6. Visibly, when A is a bialgebra, an antipode is a (two-sided) inverse to the identity map A −→ A in the monoid G(A, A) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

. With kernels and cokernels defined degreewise, the category of left A-modules is abelian. There is an analogous abelian category of right A-modules. For a right A-module (M, λ) and left A-module (N, ξ), the tensor product M ⊗A N , which of course is just an R-module, can be described as the cokernel of λ ⊗ id − id ⊗ξ : M ⊗ A ⊗ N → M ⊗ N ; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 20.4.1. Let (A, φ, η) be an algebra. A left A-module (N, ξ) is an R-module N and action ξ : A ⊗ N → N such that the following diagrams commute.

Since ⊗ is right but not left exact, the category of left C-comodules does not admit kernels in general; it is abelian if C is a flat R-module (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 20.4.2. Given an augmentation ε : A → R of A, regard R as a (left and right) A-module via ε and define QA N = R ⊗A N = N/IA · N ; QA N is called the module of A-indecomposable elements of N and is abbreviated QN (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For a general algebra A, the tensor product (over R) of A-modules is an A ⊗ A-module, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Note that any bialgebra C which contains A as a sub bialgebra is certainly a left A-coalgebra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

An R-module A such that Ai = 0 for i < 0 (as we have tacitly assumed throughout) and A0 = R is said to be connected. Note that a connected algebra admits a unique augmentation and a connected coalgebra admits a unique unit. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

For example, the homology of a connected homotopy associative H-space X is a connected Hopf algbra (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The homology of non-connected but grouplike (π0 (X) is a group) homotopy associative H-spaces leads to the more general notion of a component Hopf algebra.

When concentrated in degree zero, these are just the classical group algebras R[G]. These too have unique antipodes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

To illustrate the power of these beautiful but elementary algebraic results, we show how they can be used to prove Thom’s calculation of unoriented cobordism and Bott’s periodicity theorem for BU in §21.5 and §21.6.

We here prove various special properties that hold in the connected case but do not hold in general. However, they generally do apply to bigraded objects that are connected to the eyes of one of the gradings, and such structures can arise from filtrations of objects that are not connected.

Lemma 21.1.1. Let A be a connected coprimitive quasi Hopf algebra. Then A is associative and commutative. If the characteristic of R is a prime p, then the pth power operation ξ (defined only on even degree elements of A if p > 2) is identically zero on IA. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A Prüfer ring is an integral domain all of whose ideals are flat. A Noetherian Prüfer ring is a Dedekind ring. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The following result is a version of “Nakayama’s lemma”. It and its dual are used constantly in algebraic topology. Lemma 21.1.5. If A is a connected algebra and N is a left A-module, then N = 0 if and only if QN = 0. Proof. Clearly QN = 0 if and only if IA ⊗ N → N is an epimorphism, and this implies that N is zero by induction on degrees (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We here prove the basic results of Milnor and Moore on tensor product decompositions of connected Hopf algebras.

Since a direct summand of a flat module is flat, the assumption on π implies that QB is flat if B is flat. Of course, when R is a field, as is the case in most applications, the only assumption is that ι : A → B be a monomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

If X is a based space, then H∗ (X; R), if R-flat, is a unital component coalgebra.

The homology Hopf algebras H∗ (BU ; Z) and H∗ (BO; F2 ) enjoy a very special property: they are self-dual, so that they are isomorphic to the cohomology Hopf algebras H ∗ (BU ; Z) and H ∗ (BO; F2 ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We assume that the reader knows that the cohomology Hopf algebras are given by (21.4.1) H ∗ (BU ; Z) = P {ci | i ≥ 1} with ψ(cn ) = giv i+j=n ci ⊗ cj and (21.4.2) H ∗ (BO; F2 ) = P {wi | i ≥ 1} with ψ(wn ) = i+j=n wi ⊗ wj .

The calculations of H ∗ (BU (n); Z) and H ∗ (BO(n); F2 ) are summarized in [89, pp 187, 195], and passage to colimits over n gives the stated conclusions.

All of the structure theorems for Hopf algebras in common use in algebraic topology are best derived by filtration techniques from the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem for graded Lie algebras and restricted Lie algebras (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Of course, for any R, any associative alegbra is a Lie algebra under the commutator operation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 22.1.3. The universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra L is an associative algebra U (L) together with a morphism of Lie algebras i : L → U (L) such that, for any morphism of Lie algebras f : L → A, where A is an associative algebra, there exists a unique morphism of algebras f ˜ f˜ : U (L) → A such that f ˜ f˜i = f .

Clearly U (L) is unique up to canonical isomorphism, if it exists. Proposition 22.1.4.

The Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem gives a complete description of the associated graded Hopf algebra of U (L) with respect to a suitable filtration (under appropriate hypotheses) and therefore gives a complete description of the additive structure of U (L) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Throughout this section and the next, R is assumed to be a field of characteristic zero.

If we write E(X) for the exterior algebra generated by an R-module X concentrated in odd degrees and P (X) for the polynomial algebra generated by an R-module X concentrated in even degrees, then, for a general R-module X, A(X) = E(X − ) ⊗ P (X + ), where X − and X + denote the submodules of X concentrated in odd and even degrees, respectively (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The following immediate consequence of the previous theorem was the theorem of Hopf which initiated the study of Hopf algebras. Corollary 22.4.2 (Hopf). Let A be a connected, commutative, and associative quasi Hopf algebra such that Qn A = 0 if n is even. Then A ∼ = ∼ = E(QA) as an algebra. In particular, the conclusion holds if An = 0 for all sufficiently large n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We next show that primitive Hopf algebras in characteristic p are the universal enveloping algebras of their restricted Lie algebras of primitive elements.

Definition 23.1.1.

In this section, R is assumed to be a perfect field of characteristic p.

It is a well kept secret that the further one goes into the subject, the less one uses such complexes for actual calculation. Rather, one starts with a few spaces whose homology and cohomology groups can be computed by hand, using explicit chain complexes. One then bootstraps up such calculations to the vast array of currently known computations using a variety of spectral sequences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

McCleary’s book [95] is a good encyclopedic reference for the various spectral sequences in current use.

This map is called the transgression. It is an additive relation [76, II.6] from a 2 submodule of Ep p,0 2 to a quotient module of E0 0,p−1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Example 24.2.3. Let C be a torsion free chain complex over Z. From the short exact sequence of groups 0 /Z p /Z / Z/pZ /0 we obtain a short exact sequence of chain complexes 0 /C /C / C ⊗ Z/pZ /0.

When r = 1, this is the universal coefficient exact sequence for calculating Hn (C; Fp ), and we may view it as a higher universal coefficient exact sequence in general (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We conclude that complete knowledge of the Bockstein spectral sequences of C for all primes p allows a complete description of H∗ (C) as a graded abelian group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The previous example shows that if X is a space whose homology is of finite type and if one can compute H∗ (X; Q) and H∗ (X; Fp ) together with the mod p Bockstein spectral sequences for all primes p, then one can read off H∗ (X; Z). For this reason, among others, algebraic topologists rarely concern themselves with integral homology but rather focus on homology with field coefficients (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let A be a Z-graded complex of modules. An (increasing) filtration of A is a sequence of subcomplexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 24.3.2. If A = ∪p Fp A and for each n there exists s(n) such that Fs(n) An = 0, then E ∞ p,q 0 A = Ep p,q H∗ (A). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The proof is tedious, but elementary. We give it in the last section of the chapter for illustrative purposes. The conclusion of the theorem, E ∞ p,q A ∼ = ∼ 0 = Ep,q H∗ (A), is often written E 2 p,q A ⇒ Hp+q (A), and E r is said to converge to H∗ (A). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Dually, cohomology spectral sequences arise naturally from decreasing filtrations of complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In practice, we often start with a homological filtered complex and dualize it to obtain a cohomological one, setting A ∗ = Hom(A, R) and filtering it by F p A ∗ = Hom(A/Fp−1 A, R) At least when R is a field, the resulting cohomology spectral sequence is dual to the homology spectral sequence.

Recall that a differential graded algebra (DGA) A over R is a graded algebra with a product that is a map of chain complexes, so that the Leibnitz formula d(xy) = d(x)y + (−1) degx xd(y) is satisfied. When suitably filtered, A often gives rise to a spectral sequence of DGA’s, meaning that each term E r is a DGA. It is no exaggeration to say that the calculational utility of spectral sequences largely stems from such multiplicative structure. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Leibnitz formula for each r ≥ 1. Example 24.4.3. The cup product in the singular cochains C ∗ (X) gives rise to the product φ : H ∗ (X; Fp ) ⊗ H ∗ (X; Fp ) → H ∗ (X; Fp ). Regarding H ∗ (X; Fp ) as the E1 term of the Bockstein spectral sequence of the cochain complex C ∗ (X), we find that φ satisfies µ. Therefore each E r in the mod p cohomology Bockstein spectral sequence of X is a DGA, and E r+1 = H ∗ (E r ) as an algebra (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In applications, the important thing is to understand what the properties say. Their proofs generally play no role. In fact, this is true of most spectral sequences in algebraic topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

It is usual to construct the Serre spectral using the singular (or, in Serre’s original work, cubical) chains of all spaces in sight. We give a more direct homotopical construction that has the advantage that it generalizes effortlessly to a construction of the Serre spectral sequence in generalized homology and cohomology theories.

Using [89, p. 48], we may as well replace p by a Hurewicz fibration. This is convenient since it allows us to exploit relationship between cofibrations and fibrations that does not hold for Serre fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 24.5.1 (Homology Serre spectral sequence).

A short exact sequence 1 −→ G ′ −→ G −→ G ′′ −→ 1 of (discrete) groups gives a fibration sequence K(G ′ , 1) −→ K(G, 1) −→ K(G ′′ , 1), and there result Serre spectral sequences in homology and cohomology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

There are three kinds of geometry which possess a notion of distance, and which look the same from any viewpoint with your head turned in any orientation: these are elliptic geometry (or spherical geometry), Euclidean or parabolic geometry, and hyperbolic or Lobachevskiian geometry (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

A manifold is a topological space which is locally modelled on Rn . The notion of what it means to be locally modelled on Rn can be made definite in many different ways, yielding many different sorts of manifolds. In general, to define a kind of manifold, we need to define a set G of gluing maps which are to be permitted for piecing the manifold together out of chunks of Rn . Such a manifold is called a Gmanifold. G should satisfy some obvious properties which make it a pseudogroup of local homeomorphisms between open sets of Rn : (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Conjecture. Every three-manifold with finite fundamental group has an elliptic structure. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

If G is the group of isometries of Euclidean space E n , then a (G, E n )-manifold is called a Euclidean manifold, or often a flat manifold. Bieberbach proved that a Euclidean manifold is finitely covered by a torus. Furthermore, a Euclidean structure automatically gives an affine structure, and Bieberbach proved that closed Euclidean manifolds with the same fundamental group are equivalent as affine manifolds. If G is the group O(n + 1) acting on elliptic space Pn (or on S n ), then we obtain elliptic manifolds. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

. For example, if G is the trivial group and X is closed then closed (G, X)-manifolds are precisely the finite-sheeted covers of X, and D is the covering projection.

If X is similarly connected, then any complete (G, X)-manifold M may easily be reconstructed from the image Γ = H(π1 (M )) of the holonomy, as the quotient space X/Γ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Proposition 3.6. Let G be a group of analytic diffeomorphisms acting transitively on a manifold X, such that for any x ∈ X, the isotropy group Gx of x is compact.

If M is any closed (G, X)-manifold, then there is some ǫ > 0 such that the ǫ-ball in the Riemannian metric on M is always convex and contractible (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

For example, any closed elliptic three-manifold has universal cover S 3 , so any simply-connected elliptic manifold is S 3 . Every closed hyperbolic manifold or Euclidean manifold has universal cover hyperbolic three-space or Euclidean space. Such manifolds are consequently determined by their holonomy (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

A hyperbolic structure can be obtained by gluing two ideal triangles (with all vertices on the circle at infinity) in this pattern (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Similarly, if X is a point on the sphere at infinity, the horospheres “centered” at X are the surfaces orthogonal to all lines through X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

One property which can be used to determine the spheres centered at a point X is the fact that such a sphere is orthogonal to all lines through X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

To analyze what happens near the vertices of an ideal polyhedron when it is glued together, we need the notion of horospheres (or, in the hyperbolic plane, they are called horocycles.) A horosphere has the limiting shape of a sphere in hyperbolic space, as the radius goes to infinity (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 48</a>)</p>

Theorem 4.7. Every manifold obtained by Dehn surgery along the figure-eight knot K has a hyperbolic structure, except the six manifolds: (S 3 − K)(µ,λ) = (S 3 − K)(±µ,±λ) where (µ, λ) is (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1) or (4, 1).

The statement of the theorem is meant to suggest, but not imply, the true fact that the six exceptions do not have hyperbolic structures (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Definition 4.8.1. A codimension-k foliation of an n-manifold M is a G-structure, on M , where G is the pseudogroup of local homeomorphisms of Rn−k ×Rk which 4.23 have the local form φ(x, y) = (f (x, y), g(y)). In other words, G takes horizontal (n − k)-planes to horizontal (n − k)-planes. In other words, G takes horizontal (n − k)-planes to horizontal (n − k)-planes. These horizontal planes piece together in M as (n − k)-submanifolds, called the leaves of the foliation. M , like a book without its cover, is a disjoint union of its leaves.

Definition. An H-foliation is complete if the developing map is a fibration. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Any three-manifold with a complete codimension-2 hyperbolic foliation has universal cover H 2 × R, and covering transformations act as global isometries in the first coordinate (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

A Seifert fibration of a three-manifold M is a projection p : M → B to some surface B, so that p is a submersion and the preimages of points are circles in M . A Seifert fibration is a fibration except at a certain number of singular points x1 , . . . , xk . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

The model for the behavior in p −1 (Nǫ (xi )) is a solid torus with a foliation having the core circle as one leaf, and with all other leaves winding p times around the short way and q times around the long way, where 1 < p < q and (p, q) = 1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

A discrete group Γ of orientation-preserving isometries of a surface N has quotient N/Γ a surface (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

prove the following: Proposition 4.9.3. If g : H 2 → H 2 is a non-trivial isometry of H 2 which preserves orientation, then exactly one of the following cases occurs: (i) g has a unique interior fixed point or (ii) g leaves a unique invariant geodesic or (iii) g has a unique fixed point on the boundary of H 2 . Case (i) is called elliptic, case (ii) hyperbolic, case (iii) parabolic (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Then S is incompressible if every loop (simple closed curve) on S which bounds an (open) disk in M − S also bounds a disk in S. Some people prefer the alternate, stronger definition that S is (strongly) incompressible if π1 (S) injects into π1 (M ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

If M is oriented and irreducible (every two-sphere bounds a ball), then M is sufficiently large if it contains an incompressible and ∂-incompressible surface. A 4.39 compact, oriented, irreducible, sufficiently large three-manifold is also called a Hakenmanifold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

The only previously known examples are certain Seifert fibered spaces over S 2 with three exceptional fibers. In what follows we give the first known examples of compact, irreducible three-manifolds which are not Haken-manifolds and are not Seifert fiber spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Theorem 4.11. Every incompressible and ∂-incompressible connected surface in M is isotopic to one of S1 through S6 . Corollary. The Dehn surgery manifold M(m,l) is irreducible, and it is a Hakenmanifold if and only if (m, l) = (0, ±1) or (±4, ±1). In particular, none of the hyperbolic manifolds obtained from M by Dehn surgery is sufficiently large. (Compare 4.7.) Thus we have an infinite family of examples of oriented, irreducible, non-Haken-manifolds which are not Seifert fiber spaces. It seems likely that Dehn surgery along other knots and links would yield many more examples. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

In this section we will derive some information about the global structure of the space of hyperbolic structures on a closed, oriented surface M . This space is called the Teichmüller space of M and is defined to be the set of hyperbolic structures on M where two are equivalent if there is an isometry homotopic to the identity between them.

A distinction is often made between “loxodromic” and “hyperbolic” transformations in dimension 3. In this usage a loxodromic transformation means an isometry which is a pure translation along a geodesic followed by a non-trivial twist, while a hyperbolic transformation means a pure translation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Proposition 5.3.1. On any closed hyperbolic n-manifold M there is a unique, closed geodesic in any non-trivial free homotopy class (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Now we are in a position to describe the Teichmüller space for a closed surface. The coordinates given below are due to Nielsen and Fenchel. Pick 3g − 3 disjoint, non-parallel simple closed curves on M 2 . (This is the maximum number of such curves on a surface of genus g.) Take the corresponding geodesics and cut along them. This divides M 2 into 2g − 2 surfaces homeomorphic to S 2 —three disks (called “pairs of pants” from now on) with geodesic boundary. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Proposition 5.3.2. Two distinct geodesics in the universal cover H n of M which are invariant by two covering translations have distinct endpoints at ∞. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P.

This information leads to an easy computation of the Teichmüller space of P . Proposition 5.3.4. T(P ) is homeomorphic to R3 with coordinates (log l1 , log l2 , log l3 ), where li = length of the i-th boundary component. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Remark. If a hyperbolic surface is cut along a closed geodesic and glued back together with a twist of 2πn degrees (n an integer), then the resulting surface is isometric to the original one. However, the isometry is not isotopic to the identity so the two surfaces represent distinct points in Teichmüller space. Another way to say this is that they are isometric as surfaces but not as marked surfaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Theorem 5.3.5. The Teichmüller space T(M ) of a closed surface of genus g is homeomorphic to R6g−6 . There are explicit coordinates for T(M ), namely (log l1 , τ1 , log l2 , τ2 , . . . , log l3g−3 , τ3g−3 ), where li is the length and τi the twist coefficient for a system of 3g − 3 simple closed 5.13 geodesics.

The definition of Teichmüller space can be extended to general surfaces as the space of all metrics of constant curvature up to isotopy and change of scale. In the case of the torus T 2 , this space is the set of all Euclidean structures (i.e., metrics with constant curvature zero) on T 2 with area one (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Geometric Corollary 5.4.2. Any complete hyperbolic manifold M 3 whose fundamental group is generated by two elements a and b admits an involution s (an isometry of order 2 ) which takes a to a−1 and b to b−1 . If the generators are conjugate, there is a Z2 ⊕ Z2 action on M generated by s together with an involution t which interchanges a and b unless a and b have a common fixed point at infinity.

Remark. Actually, it can be shown that when ∂M 6= 0, a representation ρ : π1 M → PSL(2, C) is the holonomy of some hyperbolic structure for M if and only if it lifts to a representation in SL(2, C). (The obstruction to lifting is the second Stiefel–Whitney class ω2 of the associated H 3 -bundle over M .) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Theorem 5.7.1 (Mostow’s Theorem [algebraic version]). Suppose Γ1 and Γ2 are two discrete subgroups of the group of isometries of H n , n ≥ 3 such that H n /Γi has two discrete subgroups of the group of isometries of H n , n ≥ 3 such that H n /Γi has finite volume and suppose φ : Γ1 → Γ2 is a group isomorphism. Then Γ1 and Γ2 are conjugate subgroups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

If M1n and M2n are complete hyperbolic manifolds with finite total volume, any isomorphism of fundamental groups φ : π1 M1 → π1 M2 is realized by a unique isometry (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

This theorem can be restated in terms of hyperbolic manifolds since a hyperbolic manifold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Since the universal cover of a hyperbolic manifold is H n , it is a K(π, 1). Two such manifolds are homotopy equivalent if and only if there is an isomorphism between their fundamental groups. Corollary 5.7.3. If M1 and M2 are hyperbolic manifolds which are complete with finite volume, then they are homeomorphic if and only if they are homotopy equivalent. (The case of dimension two is well known.) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

For any manifold M , there is a homomorphism Diff M → Out(π1 M ), where Out(π1 M ) = Aut(π1 M )/ Inn(π1 M ) is the group of outer automorphisms. Mostow’s Theorem implies this homomorphism splits, if M is a hyperbolic manifold of dimension n ≥ 3. It is unknown whether the homomorphism splits when M is a surface. sion n ≥ 3. It is unknown whether the homomorphism splits when M is a surface. When n = 2 the kernel Diff 0 (M ) is contractible, provided χ(M ) ≤ 0. If M is a Haken 5.31 three-manifold which is not a Seifert fiber space, Hatcher has shown that Diff 0 M is contractible. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Corollary 5.7.4. If M n is hyperbolic (complete, with finite total volume) and n ≥ 3, then Out(π1 M ) is a finite group, isomorphic to the group of isometries of M n .

Remark. This result contrasts with the case n = 2 where Out(π1 M 2 ) is infinite and quite interesting. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Recall the operation of generalized Dehn surgery on M (§4.5); it is parametrized 5.33 by an ordered pair of real numbers (ai , bi ) for each end which describes how to glue a solid torus to each boundary component. If nothing is glued in, this is denoted by ∞ so that the parameters can be thought of as belonging to S 2 (i.e., the one point ∞ so that the parameters can be thought of as belonging to S 2 (i.e., the one point compactification of R2 ≈ H1 (T 2 , R)). The resulting space is denoted by Md1 ,...,dk where di = (ai , bi ) or ∞. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Theorem 5.8.2.

Given two closed hyperbolic manifolds M1 and M2 , together with an isomorphism of their fundamental groups, there is a homotopy equivalence inducing the isomorphism since M1 and M2 are K(π, 1)’s (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

A map g : X → Y between metric spaces is a pseudo-isometry if there are constants c1 , c2 such that c−1 1 d(x1 , x2 ) − c2 ≤ d(gx1 , gx2 ) ≤ c1 d(x1 , x2 ) for all x1 , x2 ∈ X.

homeomorphism of a metric space X to itself, f is K-quasi-conformal if and only if for all z ∈ X lim r→0 sup x,y∈Sr (z) d (f (x), f (y)) inf x,y∈Sr (z) d (f (x), f (y)) ≤K where Sr (Z) is the sphere of radius r around Z, and x and y are diametrically opposite. K measures the deviation of f from conformality, is equal to 1 if f is conformal, and is unchanged under composition with a conformal map. f is called quasi-conformal if it is K-quasi-conformal for some K.

Theorem 5.9.8. For a closed, hyperbolic n-manifold M , π1 M acts ergodically on n−1 S∞ , i.e., every measurable, invariant set has zero measure or full measure.

Since π1 M1 acts on n−1 S∞ conformally and e is invariant under conformal maps, e is a measurable, π1 M1 n−1 invariant function on S∞ . However, such functions are very simple because of the following theorem: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

n−1 Theorem 5.9.10. π1 (M ) acts ergodically on S∞ n−1 n−1 ∞ × S∞ . Remark. This theorem is equivalent to the fact that the geodesic flow of M is n−1 ergodic since pairs of distinct points on S∞ are in a one-to-one correspondence to n geodesics in H (whose endpoints are those points).

Now one must again invoke the theorem, from analysis, that a quasi-conformal map whose derivative is conformal a.e. is conformal in the usual sense; it is a spheren−1 preserving map of S∞ , so it extends to an isometry I of H n . The isometry I conjugates the action of π1 M1 to the action of π1 M2 , completing the proof of Mostow’s Theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Lemma 5.10.1 (The Margulis Lemma). For every dimension n there is an ǫ > 0 such that for every discrete group Γ of isometries of H n and for every x ∈ H n , Γ′ǫ (x) is abelian and Γǫ (x) has an abelian subgroup of finite index. Remark. This proposition is much more general than stated; if “abelian” is replaced by “nilpotent,” it applies in general to discrete groups of isometries of Riemannian manifolds with bounded curvature. The proof of the general statement is essentially the same (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

describes the structure of the set of all complete hyperbolic three-manifolds with volume bounded by a constant C: Theorem 5.11.2 (Jørgensen’s theorem [first version]). Let C > 0 be any constant. Among all complete hyperbolic three-manifolds with volume ≤ C, there are only finitely many homeomorphism types of M[ǫ,∞) . In other words, there is a link Lc in S 3 such that every complete hyperbolic manifold with volume ≤ C is obtained by Dehn surgery along LC . (The limiting case of deleting components of LC to obtain a non-compact manifold is permitted.) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

With somewhat more effort, we obtain Jørgensen’s theorem, which beautifully describes the structure of the set of all complete hyperbolic three-manifolds with (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Any two hyperbolic manifolds M and N such that M[ǫ,∞) = N[ǫ,∞) can be obtained from one another by Dehn surgery. All manifolds with volume ≤ C can therefore be obtained from a fixed finite set of manifolds by Dehn surgery on a fixed link in each manifold. Each member of this set can be obtained by Dehn surgery on some link in S 3 , so all manifolds with volume ≤ C can be obtained from S 3 by Dehn surgery on the disjoint union of all the relevant links (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

This notion of geometric nearness gives a topology to the set H of isometry classes of complete hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

üller space. Mostow’s Theorem implies that every closed manifold M in H is an isolated point, since M[ǫ,∞) = M when ǫ is small enough (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

On the other hand, a manifold in H with one end or cusp is a limit point, by the hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem 5.9. A manifold with two ends is a limit point of limit points and a manifold with k ends is a k-fold limit point (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Thus we obtain the inequality area ( ∂ solid torus) volume (solid torus) = 1 2 sinh r0 cosh r0 < 1 2 . The limiting case as r0 → ∞ can be computed similarly; the ratio is 1/2. Applying 5.61 this to M , we have 1 5.11.2. volume (M ) ≤ volume (M[ǫ,∞) ) + 2 area (∂M[ǫ,∞) ). It follows easily that v is a continuous function on H.

Theorem 5.12.1. The function v : H → R+ is proper. In other words, every sequence in H with bounded volume has a convergent subsequence. For every C, there is a finite set M1 , . . . , Mk of complete hyperbolic manifolds with volume ≤ C there is a finite set M1 , . . . , Mk of complete hyperbolic manifolds with volume ≤ C such that all other complete hyperbolic manifolds with volume ≤ C are obtained from this set by the process of hyperbolic Dehn surgery (as in 5.9).

Note. Gromov proved that in dimensions n 6= 3, there is only a finite number of complete hyperbolic manifolds with volume less than a given constant. He proved this more generally for negatively curved Riemannian manifolds with curvature varying between two negative constants. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Gromov also gave a weaker version of hyperbolic Dehn surgery, 5.8.2: he showed that many of the manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery can be given metrics of negative curvature close to −1.

Gromov’s norm on the real singular homology (really it is only a pseudo-norm) is obtained from this norm on cycles by passing to homology: if a ∈ Hk (X; R) is any homology class, then the norm of α is defined to be the infimum of the norms of cycles representing α, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

In particular, the norm of the fundamental class of a closed oriented manifold M gives a characteristic number of M , Gromov’s invariant of M , satisfying the inequality that for any map f : M1 → M2 , 6.1.3. k [M1 ] k ≥ | deg f | k [M2 ] k.

6.1. Gromov’s invariant Let X be any topological space. Denote the real singular chain complex of X by C ∗ (k). (Recall that Ck (X) is the vector space with a basis consisting of all continuous maps of the standard simplex ∆k into X.) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Example. The n-sphere n ≥ 1 admits maps f : S n → S n of degree 2 (and higher). As a consequence of 6.1.2 k [S n ] k = 0. More explicitly, one may picture a sequence {zi } representing the fundamental class of S 1 , where zi is ( il )σi and σi wraps a 1-simplex i times around S 1 . Since kzi k = 1i , k [S 1 ] k = 0. As a trivial example, k [S 0 ] k = 2. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

For k = 2, there is only one ideal simplex up to isometry. We have seen that 2 copies of the ideal triangle fit inside a compact surface (§3.9). Thus it has finite volume, which equals π by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

When k = 3, there is an efficient formula for the computation of the volume of an ideal 3-simplex; see Milnor’s discussion of volumes in chapter 7.

It is conjectured that in general, vk is the volume of the regular ideal k-simplex; if so, Milnor has computations for more values, and a good asymptotic formula as k → ∞.

Intuitively, Gromov’s norm measures the efficiency with which multiples of a homology class can be represented by simplices. A complicated homology class needs many simplices.

For any manifold M , let C 1 (∆k , M ) denote the space of maps of ∆k to M , with the C 1 topology. We define a new notion of chains, where a k-chain is a Borel measure µ on C 1 (∆K , M ) with compact support total variation of a measure µ is kµk = sup{ of chains, wher port R and bounde f dµ | |f | ≤ 1}.

Theorem 6.2.2. For any pair (G, X), where G acts transitively on X with compact isotropy groups and for any invariant volume form on X, there is a constant C 6.10 such that every closed oriented (G, X)-manifold M satisfies k [M ] k = Cv(M ), (where v(M ) is the volume of M ).

Gromov gave a very quick proof of Mostow’s theorem for hyperbolic three-manifolds, based on 6.2.

Lemma 6.3.1. If M1 and M2 are homotopy equivalent, closed, oriented hyperbolic manifolds, then v(M1 ) = v(M2 ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

If M is a manifold and A ⊂ M a submanifold, the relative chain group Ck (M, A) is defined to be the quotient Ck (M )/Ck (A). The norm on Ck (M ) goes over to a norm on Ck (M, A) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Gromov’s invariant of a compact, oriented norm kγk of a homology class γ ∈ Hk (M, A) is defined, as before, to be the infimal norm of relative cycles representing γ. Gromov’s invariant of a compact, oriented manifold with boundary (M, ∂M ) is [M, ∂M ] , where [M, ∂M ] denotes the relative fundamental cycle. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

For any finite sheeted covering space p : M̃ → M there is a canonical chain map, transfer: C∗ (M ) → C∗ (M̃ ). The transfer of a singular simplex is simply the average of its lifts to ̃ M̃ ; this extends in an obvious way to measures on singular simplices.

With 6.5.5 combined with 6.5.2, one can compute Gromov’s invariant for any manifold which is obtained from Seifert fiber spaces and complete hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume by identifying along incompressible tori.

Theorem 6.5.6. Suppose M1 is a complete hyperbolic manifold of finite volume and that M2 6= M1 is a complete hyperbolic manifold obtained topologically by replacing certain cusps of M1 by solid tori. Then v(M1 ) > v(M2 ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P.

Closed oriented surfaces can be arranged very neatly in a single sequence, in terms of their Euler characteristic. What happens when we arrange all hyperbolic three-manifolds in terms of their volume? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

follows that the set of volumes is a closed subset of R+ . Furthermore, by combining Jørgensen’s theorem with the relative version of Gromov’s theorem, 6.5.4, we obtain Corollary 6.6.1. The set of volumes of hyperbolic three-manifolds is well-ordered. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

a convergent sequence of manifolds with non-increasing volume must be eventually constant. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

In view of these results, the volumes of complete hyperbolic manifolds are indexed by countable ordinals. In other words, there is a smallest volume v1 , a next smallest volume v2 , and so forth. This sequence v1 < v2 < v3 < · · · < vk < · · · has a limit point vω , which is the smallest volume of a complete hyperbolic manifold with one cusp.

It would be very interesting if a computer study could determine some of the low volumes, such as v1 , v2 , vω , vω2 . It seems plausible that some of these might come from Dehn surgery on the Borromean rings. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

There is some constant C such that every manifold with k cusps has volume ≥ C ·k. This follows from the analysis in 5.11.2: the number of boundary components of M[ǫ, ∞) is bounded by the number of disjoint ǫ/2 balls which can fit in M . It would be interesting to calculate or estimate the best constant C (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Corollary 6.6.3. The set of values of Gromov’s invariant k [ ] k0 on the class of connected manifolds obtained from Seifert fiber spaces and complete hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume by identifying along incompressible tori is a closed wellordered subset of R+ , with order type ω ω . We shall see later (§ ) that this class contains all Haken manifolds with toral boundaries. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Definition 6.7.1. If Γ1 and Γ2 are two discrete subgroups of isometries of H n , then Γ1 is commensurable with Γ2 if Γ1 is conjugate (in the group of isometries of H n ) to a group Γ′1 1 such that Γ′ ∩ Γ2 has finite index in Γ′1 and in Γ2 . Definition 6.7.2. Two manifolds M1 and M2 are commensurable if they have finited sheeted covers ̃ M̃1 and ̃ M̃2 which are homeomorphic. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Example 6.7.3. If W is the Whitehead link and B is the Borromean rings, then S 3 − W has a four-sheeted cover homeomorphic with a two sheeted cover of S 3 − B: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Proposition 6.7.3. If M1 is a complete hyperbolic manifold with finite volume and M2 is commensurable with M1 , then M2 is homotopy equivalent to a complete hyperbolic manifold. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P.

Waldhausen proved that two Haken manifolds which are homotopy equivalent are homeomorphic, so this would follow whenever M1 is Haken. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

so this would follow whenever M1 is Haken. There are some sorts of properties of three-manifolds which do not change under passage to a finite-sheeted cover. For this reason (and for its own sake) it would be interesting to have a better understanding of the commensurability relation among three-manifolds. This is difficult to approach from a purely topological point of view, but there is a great deal of information about commensurability given by a hyperbolic structure. For instance, in the case of a complete non-compact (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Proposition 6.7.4. If Γ is a discrete subgroup of PSL(2, C) such that H 3 /Γ has finite volume, then Γ is conjugate to a group of matrices whose entries are algebraic (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

One can ask the more subtle question, whether all entries can be made algebraic integers. Hyman Bass has proved the following remarkable result regarding this question: Theorem 6.7.5 (Bass). Let M be a complete hyperbolic three-manifold of finite volume. Then either π1 (M ) is conjugate to a subgroup of PSL(2, O), where O is the ring of algebraic integers, or M contains a closed incompressible surface (not homotopic to a cusp).

If two manifolds are commensurable, then their volumes have a rational ratio. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

For a p-typical analog of 1.3.6 we need to replace b by cogroupoid object in the category of commutative Z(p) -algebras K. Such an object is called a Hopf algebroid (A1.1.1) and consists of a pair (A, Γ) of commutative rings with appropriate structure maps so that Hom(A, K) and Hom(Γ, K) are the sets of objects and morphisms, respectively, of a groupoid.

The Adams spectral sequence of 2.2.3 is useful for computing π∗ (X), i.e., [S 0 , X]. With additional assumptions on E one can generalize to a spectral sequence for computing [W, X].

In this section we will consider four spectra (M O, M U , bo, and bu) in which the change-of-rings isomorphism of A1.1.18 can be used to great advantage (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

. Its greatest attraction, which will not be exploited here, is that it contains for each n > 0 a subcomplex Λ(n) whose cohomology is the E2 -term of a spectral sequence converging to the 2-component of the unstable homotopy groups of S n .

n Section 1 we made some easy Ext calculations and thereby computed the homotopy groups of such spectra as M U and bo.

analyzed by other methods (see Stong [1] for references) but in theory could be analyzed with the Adams spectral sequence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

The spectrum M Oh8i (the Thom spectrum associated with the 7-connected cover of BO) has been investigated by Adams spectral sequence methods in Giambalvo [2], Bahri [1], Davis [3, 6], and Bahri and Mahowald [1]. In Johnson and Wilson [5] the Adams spectral sequence is used to compute the bordism ring of manifolds with free G-action for an elementary abelian p-group G.

The most prodigious Adams spectral sequence calculation to date is that for the symplectic cobordism ring by Kochman [1, 2, 3]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

In Section 2 we described the May SS. The work of Nakamura [1] enables one to use algebraic Steenrod operations (A1.5) to compute May differentials.

Finally, we must mention the Whitehead conjecture. The n-fold symmetric product Spn (X) of a space X is the quotient of the n-fold Cartesian product by the action of the symmetric group Σn . Dold and Thom [1] showed tha (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

Sp ∞ (X) = lim Spn (X) is a product of Eilenberg–Mac Lane spaces whosw homo←− topy is the homotopy of X. Symmetric products can be defined on spectra and we have Sp∞ (S 0 ) = HJ, the integer Eilenbergh–Mac Lane spectrum. After localizing at the prime p one considers S 0 → Spp (S 0 ) → Spp 2 (S 0 ) → · · · and (3.5.16) H ← S 0 ← Σ−1 Spp (S 0 )/S 0 ← Σ−2 Spp 2 (S 0 )/Spp (S 0 ) ← · · · . Whitehead conjectured that this diagram induces an long exact sequence of homotopy groups. In particular, the map Σ−1 Spp (S 0 )/S 0 → S 0 shouls induce a surjection in homotopy in positive dimensions; this is the famous theorem of Kahn surjection in homotopy in positive dimensions; this is the famous theorem of Kahn and Priddy (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

In Section 4 we set up the Adams–Novikov spectral sequence and use it to compute the stable homotopy groups of spheres through a middling range of dimensions, namely ≤ 24 for p = 2 and ≤ 2p3 − 2p − 1 for p > 2.

The main results are Quillen’s theorem 4.1.6, which identifies π∗ (M U ) with the Lazard ring L (A2.1.8); the Landweber–Novikov theorem 4.1.11, which describes M U∗ (M U ); the Brown– Peterson theorem 4.1.12, which gives the spectrum BP ; and the Quillen–Adams theorem 4.1.19, which describes BP∗ (BP (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

We begin by informally defining the spectrum M U . For more details see Milnor and Stasheff [5]. Recall that for each n ≥ 0 the group of complex unitary n × n matrices U (n) has a classifying space BU (n). It has a complex n-plane bundle γn over it which is universal in the sense that any such bundle ξ over a paracompact space X is the pullback of γn , induced by a map f : X → BU (n). Isomorphism classes of such bundles ξ are in one-to-one correspondence with homotopy classes of classes of such bundles ξ are in one-to-one correspondence with homotopy classes of maps from X to BU (n). Any Cn -bundle ξ has an associated disc bundle D(ξ) and sphere bundle S(ξ). The Thom space T (ξ) is the quotient D(ξ)/S(ξ). Alternatively, for compact X, T (ξ) is the one-point compactification of the total space of ξ. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C. Ravenel/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres (569)/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Grou - Douglas C. Ravenel.pdf#page=123" target="_blank">Douglas C. Ravenel 123</a>)</p>
M U (n) is T (γn ), the Thom space of the universal n-plane bundle γn over BU (n). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C. Ravenel/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres (569)/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Grou - Douglas C. Ravenel.pdf#page=123" target="_blank">Douglas C. Ravenel 123</a>)</p>
It follows from the celebrated theorem of Thom [1] that π∗ (M U ) is isomorphic to the complex cobordisrn ring (see Milnor [4]) which is defined as follow (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C. Ravenel/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres (569)/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Grou - Douglas C. Ravenel.pdf#page=124" target="_blank">Douglas C. Ravenel 124</a>)</p>
A stably complex manifold is one with a complex structure on its stable normal bundle. (This notion of a complex manifold is weaker than others, e.g., algebraic, analytic, and almost complex.) All such manifolds are oriented. Two closed stably complex manifolds M1 and M2 are cobordant if there is a stably complex manifold W whose boundary is the disjoint union of M1 (with the opposite of the given orientation) and M2 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C. Ravenel/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres (569)/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Grou - Douglas C. Ravenel.pdf#page=124" target="_blank">Douglas C. Ravenel 124</a>)</p>
Milnor and Novikov’s calculation of π∗ (M U ) (3.1.5) implies that two such manifolds are cobordant if they have the same Chern numbers. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C. Ravenel/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres (569)/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Grou - Douglas C. Ravenel.pdf#page=124" target="_blank">Douglas C. Ravenel 124</a>)</p>
On the other hand, the connection with formal group laws (A2.1.1) discovered by Quillen [2] (see 4.1.6) is essential to all that follows. This leads one to suspect that there is some unknown formal group theoretic construction of M U or its associated infinite loop space. For example, many well-known infinite loop spaces have been constructed as classifying spaces of certain types of categories (see Adams [9], section 2.6), but to our knowledge no such description exists for M U . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C. Ravenel/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres (569)/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Grou - Douglas C.

4.1.1. Definition. Let E be an associative commutative ring spectrum. A complex orientation for E is a class 1 E(CP ) xE ∈ E e ≃E e 2 (S e 2 (CP ∞ ) whose restriction to E = π0 (E) is 1, where CP e E(CP 1 )≃Ee 2 (S 2 ) ∼ = π0 (E) n denotes n-dimensional complex projective space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

Recall that M U is built up out of Thom spaces M U (n) of complex vector bundles over BU (n) and that the map BU (n) → M U (n) is an equivalence when n = 1. The composition is an equivalence when n = (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

Alternatively, xM U could be defined to be the first Conner–Floyd Chern class of the canonical complex line bundle over CP ∞ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

Hence a complex orientation xE leads to a formal group law FE over E ∗ (pt.). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

Brown and Peterson [1] also showed that BP can be constructed from H (the integral Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum) by killing all of the torsion in its integral homology with Postnikov fibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

More recently, 0 Priddy [1] has shown that BP can be constructed from S(p) by adding local cells to kill off all of the torsion in its homotopy.

BP bears the same relation to p-typical formal group laws (A2.1.17) that M U bears to formal group laws as seen in 4.1.6 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

We say that two posets P and Q are isomorphic if there is a bijection (one-to-one and onto function) 'W P ! Q such that x  y in P if and only if '.x/  '.y/ in Q.

It is true in general that two spaces X and Y are homotopy equivalent if and only if there exists a third space Z containing both X and Y as deformation retracts. For the less trivial implication one can in fact take Z to be the mapping cylinder M f of any homotopy equivalence f : X →Y .

This is equivalent to saying that RP n is the quotient space of a hemisphere D n with antipodal points of ∂D n identified (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Allen Hatcher/Algebraic Topology (609)/Algebraic Topology - Allen Hatcher.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Allen Hatcher 15</a>)</p>
The sphere S n has the structure of a cell complex with just two cells, e 0 and e n , the n cell being attached by the constant map S n−1 →e0 . This is equivalent to regarding S n as the quotient space D n /∂D n . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Allen Hatcher/Algebraic Topology (609)/Algebraic Topology - Allen Hatcher.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Allen Hatcher 15</a>)</p>
Since ∂D n with antipodal points identified is just RP n−1 , we see that RP n is obtained from RP n−1 by attaching an n cell, with the quotient projection S n−1 →RPn−1 as the attaching map. It follows by induction on n that RP n has a cell complex structure e 0 ∪ e 1 ∪ ··· ∪ e n with one cell e i in each dimension i ≤ n .

Suspension. For a space X , the suspension SX is the quotient of X × I obtained by collapsing X × {0} to one point and X × {1} to another point (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Allen Hatcher/Algebraic Topology (609)/Algebraic Topology - Allen Hatcher.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Allen Hatcher 17</a>)</p>
One especially useful property of suspension is that not only spaces but also maps can be suspended. Namely, a map f : X →Y suspends to Sf : SX →SY , the quotient map of f × 11 : X × I →Y × I . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Allen Hatcher/Algebraic Topology (609)/Algebraic Topology - Allen Hatcher.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Allen Hatcher 18</a>)</p>
The smash product X ∧ Y is then defined to be the quotient X × Y /X ∨ Y . One can think of X ∧ Y as a reduced version of X × Y obtained by collapsing away the parts that are not genuinely a product, the separate factors X and Y .

but one might hope that if the subspace being collapsed already has the homotopy type of a point, then collapsing it to a point might not change the homotopy type of the whole space. Here is a positive result in this direction: If (X, A) is a CW pair consisting of a CW complex X and a contractible subcomplex A , then the quotient map X →X/A is a homotopy equivalence.

Since these isomorphisms are natural, and rotations of S n−1 have degree 1 , being homotopic to the identity, while reflections have degree −1 , we see that a rotation ρ of Rn fixing x takes a generator α of Hn (Rn , Rn − {x}) to itself, ρ∗ (α) = α , while a reflection takes α to −α .

σ a ϕ = ϕ Poincaré Duality Section 3.3 239 must take a generator of Cn (M) to twice a generator α of a Z summand of Cn−1 (M) , in order for Hn (M; Zp ) to be zero for odd primes p and Z2 for p = 2 . The cellular chain α must be a cycle since 2α is a boundary and hence a cycle. It follows that the torsion subgroup of Hn−1 (M; Z) must be a Z2 generated by α . Concerning the homology of noncompact manifolds there is the following general statement. Proposition 3.29. If M is a connected noncompact n manifold, then Hi (M; R) = 0 for i ≥ n . Proof: Represent an element of Hi (M; R) by a cycle z . This has compact image in M , so there is an open set U ⊂ M containing the image of z and having compact closure U ⊂ M . Let V = M − U . Part of the long exact sequence of the triple (M, U ∪ V , V ) fits into a commutative diagram When i > n , the two groups on either side of Hi (U ∪ V , V ; R) are zero by Lemma 3.27 since U ∪ V and V are the complements of compact sets in M . Hence Hi (U; R) = 0 , so z is a boundary in U and therefore in M , and we conclude that Hi (M; R) = 0 . When i = n , the class [z] ∈ Hn (M; R) defines a section x ֏ [z]x of MR . Since M is connected, this section is determined by its value at a single point, so [z]x will be zero for all x if it is zero for some x , which it must be since z has compact image and M is noncompact. By Lemma 3.27, z then represents zero in Hn (M, V ; R) , hence also in Hn (U; R) since the first term in the upper row of the diagram above is zero when i = n , by Lemma 3.27 again. So [z] = 0 in Hn (M; R) , and therefore Hn (M; R) = 0 since [z] was an arbitrary element of this group. ⊓ ⊔ The Duality Theorem The form of Poincaré duality we will prove asserts that for an R orientable closed n manifold, a certain naturally defined map H k (M; R)→Hn−k (M; R) is an isomorphism. The definition of this map will be in terms of a more general construction called cap product, which has close connections with cup product.

The algebra in the skew-symmetric case is rather simple: With a suitable choice of basis, the matrix of a skew-symmetric nonsingular bilinear form over Z can be put into the standard form consisting of 2× 2 blocks 252 Chapter 3 Cohomology an isomorphism for j ≤ 2n + 1 . As with RPn , the ring structure in H ∗ (L2n+1 ; Z) is determined by the ring structure in H ∗ (L2n+1 ; Zm ) , and likewise for L∞ , where one has the slightly simpler structure H ∗ (L∞ ; Z) ≈ Z[α]/(mα) with |α| = 2 . The case of L2n+1 is obtained from this by setting αn+1 = 0 and adjoining the extra Z ≈ H 2n+1 (L2n+1 ; Z) . A different derivation of the cup product structure in lens spaces is given in Example 3E.2. Using the ad hoc notation Hfkr ee (M) for H k (M) modulo its torsion subgroup, the preceding proposition implies that for a closed orientable manifold M of dimension 2n , the middle-dimensional cup product pairing Hfnr ee (M)× Hfnr ee (M)→Z is a nonsingular bilinear form on Hfnr ee (M) . This form is symmetric or skew-symmetric according to whether n is even or odd. The algebra in the skew-symmetric case is rather simple: With a suitable choice of basis, the matrix of a skew-symmetric nonsingular bilinear form over Z can be put into the standard form consisting of 2× 2 blocks 0 −1  1 0 along the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, according to an algebra exercise at the end of the section. In particular, the rank of H n (M 2n ) must be even when n is odd. We are already familiar with these facts in the case n = 1 by the explicit computations of cup products for surfaces in §3.2. The symmetric case is much more interesting algebraically. There are only finitely many isomorphism classes of symmetric nonsingular bilinear forms over Z of a fixed rank, but this ‘finitely many’ grows rather rapidly, for example it is more than 80 million for rank 32; see [Serre 1973] for an exposition of this beautiful chapter of number theory. One can ask whether all these forms actually occur as cup product pairings in closed manifolds M 4k for a given k . The answer is yes for 4k = 4, 8, 16 but seems to be unknown in other dimensions. In dimensions 4 , 8 , and 16 one can even take M 4k to be simply-connected and have the bare minimum of homology: Z ’s in dimensions 0 and 4k and a free abelian group in dimension 2k . In dimension 4 there are at most two nonhomeomorphic simply-connected closed 4 manifolds with the same bilinear form. Namely, there are two manifolds with the same form if the square α ` α of some α ∈ H 2 (M 4 ) is an odd multiple of a generator of H 4 (M 4 ) , for example for CP2 , and otherwise the M 4 is unique, for example for S 4 or S 2 × S 2 ; see [Freedman & Quinn 1990]. In §4.C we take the first step in this direction by proving a classical result of J. H. C. Whitehead that the homotopy type of a simply-connected closed 4 manifold is uniquely determined by its cup product structure. Other Forms of Duality Generalizing the definition of a manifold, an n manifold with boundary is a Hausdorff space M in which each point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic either to Rn or to the half-space Rn n + = { (x1 , ··· , xn ) ∈ R | xn ≥ 0 } . If a point x ∈ M corresponds under such a homeomorphism to a point (x1 , ··· , xn ) ∈ Rn + with 0 1 1 0  along the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Allen Hatcher/Algebraic Topology (609)/Algebraic Topology - Allen Hatcher.pdf#page=261" target="_blank">Allen Hatcher 261</a>)</p>

One of the rare cases when a CW complex does have its homotopy type uniquely determined by its homotopy groups is when it has just a single nontrivial homotopy group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Allen Hatcher/Algebraic Topology (609)/Algebraic Topology - Allen Hatcher.pdf#page=346" target="_blank">Allen Hatcher 346</a>)</p>

Among other things, fibrations allow one to describe, in theory at least, how the homotopy type of an arbitrary CW complex is built up from its homotopy groups by an inductive procedure of forming ‘twisted products’ of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Allen Hatcher/Algebraic Topology (609)/Algebraic Topology - Allen Hatcher.pdf#page=347" target="_blank">Allen Hatcher 347</a>)</p>

The Grothendieck spectral sequence ‘computes’ the derived functor of the composition Grothendieck spectral sequence ‘computes’ the derived functor of the composition of two functors: for example, if + A — B and # : B — C are two rightexact of two functors: for example, if + A — B and # : B — C are two rightexact functors and sends projectivs to projectives,then thre is a spectral sequence functors and sends projectivs to projectives,then thre is a spectral sequenc whose E; term callcts the compasitons ,#oL, ad that abuts tLy(#0.5) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Paolo Aluffi/Algebra_ Chapter 0 (611)/Algebra_ Chapter 0 - Paolo Aluffi.pdf#page=717" target="_blank">Paolo Aluffi 717</a>)</p>
For instance,if f : R — § is a homomorphism of commutative rings (so that S may be viewed as an R-module), A is an R-module, and B is an S-module (and hence an R-module,via f), then there is a ‘change-of-ring spectral sequence’ TorS(Tork(4,5), B) = Tork(A,B). In topology,the Serre spectral sequence can TorS(Tork(4,5), B) = Tork(A,B). In topology,the Serre spectral sequence can be use compute the homology of a bration in terms ofthe homology ofth base and of the fiber.

The study of generalized homology and cohomology theories pervades modern algebraic topology. These theories satisfy the excision axiom. One constructs most such theories homotopically, by constructing representing objects called spectra, and one must then prove that excision holds. There is a way to do this in general that is no more difficult than the standard verification for singular homology and cohomology. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A function p : X −→ Y is continuous if it takes nearby points to nearby points. Precisely, p−1 (U ) is open if U is open.

Theorem (Brouwer fixed point theorem). Any continuous map f : D 2 −→ D 2 has a fixed point. Proof. Suppose that f (x) 6= x for all x. Define r(x) ∈ S 1 to be the intersection with S 1 of the ray that starts at f (x) and passes through x. Certainly r(x) = x if x ∈ S 1 . By writing an equation for r in terms of f , we see that r is continuous. This contradicts the proposition. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

3. Natural transformations A natural transformation α : F −→ G between functors C −→ D is a map of functors.

For example, if F : S −→ A b is the functor that sends a set to the free Abelian group that it generates and U : A b −→ S is the forgetful functor that sends an Abelian group to its underlying set, then we have a natural inclusion of sets S −→ U F (S).

The functors F and U are left adjoint and right adjoint to each other, in the sense that we have a natural isomorphism A b(F (S), A) ∼ = ∼ = S (S, U (A)) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

for a set S and an Abelian group A. This just expresses the “universal property” of free objects: a map of sets S −→ U (A) extends uniquely to a homomorphism of groups F (S) −→ A.

When we have a (suitable) relation of homotopy between maps in a category C , we define the homotopy category hC to be the category with the same objects as C but with morphisms the homotopy classes of maps (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Less mysteriously, a map f : X −→ Y is a homotopy equivalence if there is a map g : Y −→ X such that both g ◦ f ≃ id and f ◦ g ≃ id. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Functors carry isomorphisms to isomorphisms, so we see that a based homotopy equivalence induces an isomorphism of fundamental groups. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. If f : X −→ Y is a homotopy equivalence, then f∗ : π1 (X, x) −→ π1 (Y, f (x)) is an isomorphism for all x ∈ X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For this purpose, we define the “fundamental groupoid” Π(X) of a space X to be the category whose objects are the points of X and whose morphisms x −→ y are the equivalence classes of paths from x to y. Thus the set of endomorphisms of the object x is exactly the fundamental group π1 (X, x). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

There is a useful notion of a skeleton skC of a category C . This is a “full” subcategory with one object from each isomorphism class of objects of C , “full” meaning that the morphisms between two objects of skC are all of the morphisms between these objects in C . The inclusion functor J : skC −→ C is an equivalence of categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let D be a small category and let C be any category. A D-shaped diagram in C is a functor F : D −→ C . A morphism F −→ F ′ of D-shaped diagrams is a natural transformation, and we have the category D[C ] of D-shaped diagrams in C (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The colimit, colim F , of a D-shaped diagram F is an object of C together with a morphism of diagrams ι : F −→ colim F that is initial among all such morphisms.

This means that if η : F −→ A is a morphism of diagrams, then there is a unique map η̃ : colim F −→ A in C such that η̃ ◦ ι = η. Diagrammatically, this property is expressed by the assertion that, for each map d : D −→ D′ in D, we have a commutative diagram F (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The limit of F is defined by reversing arrows: it is an object lim F of C together with a morphism of diagrams π : lim F −→ F that is terminal among all such morphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If D is a set regarded as a discrete category (only identity morphisms), then colimits and limits indexed on D are coproducts and products indexed on the set D. Coproducts are disjoint unions in S or U , wedges (or one-point unions) in T , free products in G , and direct sums in A b. Products are Cartesian products in all of these categories; more precisely, they are Cartesian products of underlying sets, with additional structure. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If D is the category displayed schematically as eo /f or // d′ , d d where we have displayed all objects and all non-identity morphisms, then the colimits indexed on D are called pushouts or coequalizers, respectively. Similarly, if D is displayed schematically as e /do f or // d′ , d (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

then the limits indexed on D are called pullbacks or equalizers, respectively (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">J. Peter May 25</a>)</p>
A category is said to be cocomplete if it has all colimits, complete if it has all limits. The categories S , U , T , G , and A b are complete and cocomplete. If a category has coproducts and coequalizers, then it is cocomplete, and similarly for completeness. The proof is a worthwhile exercise. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

While the reader is free to think about locally contractible spaces, weaker conditions are appropriate for the full generality of the theory of covering spaces. A space X is said to be locally path connected if for any x ∈ X and any neighborhood U of x, there is a smaller neighborhood V of x each of whose points can be connected to x by a path in U . This is equivalent to the seemingly more stringent requirement that the topology of X have a basis consisting of path connected open sets. In fact, if X is locally path connected and U is an open neighborhood of a point x, then the set V = {y | y can be connected to x by a path in U } is a path connected open neighborhood of x that is contained in U (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. A covering p : E −→ B is regular if p∗ (π1 (E, e)) is a normal subgroup of π1 (B, b). It is universal if E is simply connected (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

As we shall explain in §4, for a universal cover p : E −→ B, the elements of Fb are in bijective correspondence with the elements of π1 (B, b). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Example. For n ≥ 2, S n is a universal cover of RP n . Therefore π1 (RP n ) has only two elements. There is a unique group with two elements, and this proves our earlier claim that π1 (RP n ) = Z2 .

As e′ runs through Fb , the groups p∗ (π1 (E, e′ )) run through all conjugates of p∗ (π1 (E, e)) in π1 (B, b). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The category x\C of objects under x has objects the maps f : x −→ y in C ; for objects f : x −→ y and g : x −→ z, the morphisms γ : f −→ g in x\C are the morphisms γ : y −→ z in C such that γ ◦ f = g : x −→ z.

(iii) Let E and B be small connected groupoids. A covering p : E −→ B is a functor that is surjective on objects and restricts to a bijection (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For an object b of B, let Fb denote the set of objects of E such that p(e) = b. Then p−1 (St(b)) is the disjoint union over e ∈ Fb of St(e). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. If p : E −→ B is a covering of spaces, then the induced functor Π(p) : Π(E) −→ Π(B) is a covering of groupoids (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The fibers Fb of a covering of groupoids are related by translation functions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">J. Peter May 31</a>)</p>
Proposition. Any two fibers Fb and Fb′ of a covering of groupoids have the same cardinality. Therefore any two fibers of a covering of spaces have the same cardinality.

The isotropy group Gs of a point s is the subgroup {g|gs = s} of G. An action is free if gs = s implies g = e, that is, if Gs = e for every s ∈ S. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

An action is transitive if for every pair s, s′ of elements of S, there is an element g of G such that gs = s′ . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

When G acts transitively on a set S, we obtain an isomorphism of G-sets between S and the G-set G/Gs for any fixed s ∈ S by sending gs to the coset gGs (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For a subgroup H of G, let N H denote the normalizer of H in G and define W H = N H/H. Such quotient groups W H are sometimes called Weyl groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A covering of groupoids is universal if and only if π(B, b) acts freely on Fb , and then Fb is isomorphic to π(B, b) as a π(B, b)-set. Specializing to covering spaces, this sharpens our earlier claim that the elements of Fb and π1 (B, b) are in bijective correspondence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. If it exists, the universal cover of B is unique up to isomorphism and covers any other cover. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We have given an algebraic classification of all possible covers of B: there is at most one isomorphism class of covers corresponding to each conjugacy class of subgroups of π(B, b) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=35" target="_blank">J. Peter May 35</a>)</p>
We begin with the following result, which deserves to be called the fundamental theorem of covering space theory and has many other applications (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In particular, two maps of covers g, g ′ : E −→ E ′ coincide if g(e) = g ′ (e) for any one e ∈ E. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. If it exists, the universal cover of B is unique up to isomorphism and covers any other cover. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We hasten to add that the theorem above is atypical of algebraic topology. It is not usually the case that algebraic invariants like the fundamental group totally determine the existence and uniqueness of maps of topological spaces with prescribed properties (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. Let p : E −→ B be a covering and choose b ∈ B and e ∈ Fb . Write G = π1 (B, b) and H = p∗ (π1 (E, e)). Then Aut(E) is isomorphic to the group of automorphisms of the G-set Fb and therefore to the group W H. If p is regular, then Aut(E) ∼ = ∼ = G/H. If p is universal, then Aut(E) ∼ = ∼ = G (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

We have now given an algebraic classification of all possible covers of B: there is at most one isomorphism class of covers corresponding to each conjugacy class of subgroups of π1 (B, b).

We show here that all of these possibilities are actually realized. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">J. Peter May 38</a>)</p>
Again, while it suffices to think in terms of locally contractible spaces, appropriate generality demands a weaker hypothesis. We say that a space B is semi-locally simply connected if every point b ∈ B has a neighborhood U such that π1 (U, b) −→ π1 (B, b) is the trivial homomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. If B is connected, locally path connected, and semi-locally simply connected, then B has a universal cover. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. A G-space X is a space X that is a G-set with continuous action map G × X −→ X. Define the orbit space X/G to be the set of orbits {Gx|x ∈ X} with its topology as a quotient space of X.

The definition makes sense for general topological groups G. However, our interest here is in discrete groups G, for which the continuity condition just means that action by each element of G is a homeomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. Let p : E −→ B be a cover such that Aut(E) acts transitively on Fb . Then the cover p is regular and E/ Aut(E) is homeomorphic to B. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A map f : X −→ Y is said to be a local homeomorphism if every point of X has an open neighborhood that maps homeomorphically onto an open set in Y . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let X be a G-space, where G is a (discrete) group.

We define graphs, describe their homotopy types, and use them to show that a subgroup of a free group is free and that any group is the fundamental group of some space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Observe that a graph is a locally contractible space: any neighborhood of any point contains a contractible neighborhood of that point. Therefore a connected graph has all possible covers.

A graph is finite if it has only finitely many vertices and edges or, equivalently, if it is a compact space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A subspace A of a space X is a deformation retract if there is a homotopy h : X × I −→ X such that h(x, 0) = x, h(a, t) = a, and h(x, 1) ∈ A for all x ∈ X, a ∈ A, and t ∈ I. Such a homotopy is called a deformation of X onto A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

for a suitably nice inclusion, called a “cofibration,” of a contractible space T in a space X, the quotient map X −→ X/T is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Let X be a connected graph with maximal tree T . Then the quotient space X/T is the wedge of one circle for each edge of X not in T , and the quotient map q : X −→ X/T is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

types of graphs has the following immediate implication. Corollary. If X is a connected graph, then π1 (X) is a free group with one generator for each edge not in a given maximal tree. If X is finite, then π1 (X) is free on 1 − χ(X) generators; in particular, χ(X) ≤ 1, with equality if and only if X is a tree. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. If B is a connected graph with vertex set B 0 and p : E −→ B is a covering, then E is a connected graph with vertex set E 0 = p−1 (B 0 ) and with one edge for each edge j of B and point e ∈ Fj(0) . Therefore, if B is finite and p is a finite cover whose fibers have cardinality n, then E is finite and χ(E) = nχ(B). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. For any group G, there is a connected space X such that π1 (X) is isomorphic to G. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The space X constructed in the proof is called the “homotopy cofiber” of the map p. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">J. Peter May 46</a>)</p>
The homotopy and homology groups of spaces are supported on compact subspaces, and it turns out that if one assumes a separation property that is a little weaker than the Hausdorff property, then one can refine the point-set topology of spaces to eliminate such pathology without changing these invariants.

We shall understand compact spaces to be both compact and Hausdorff (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=47" target="_blank">J. Peter May 47</a>)</p>
A space X is said to be “weak Hausdorff” if g(K) is closed in X for every map g : K −→ X from a compact space K into X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A space X is “compactly generated” if it is a weak Hausdorff k-space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=47" target="_blank">J. Peter May 47</a>)</p>
Lemma. If X is a compactly generated space and Y is any space, then a function f : X −→ Y is continuous if and only if its restriction to each compact subspace K of X is continuous (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A subspace A of X is said to be “compactly closed” if g −1 (A) is closed in K for any map g : K −→ X from a compact space K into X. When X is weak Hausdorff, this holds if and only if the intersection of A with each compact subset of X is closed. A space X is a “k-space” if every compactly closed subspace is closed (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

By definition, a space X is Hausdorff if the diagonal subspace ∆X = {(x, x)} is closed in X ×c X. The weak Hausdorff property admits a similar characterization. Lemma.

The interpretation is that a quotient space of a compactly generated space by a “closed equivalence relation” is compactly generated (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. If X and Y are compactly generated spaces, A is a closed subspace of X, and f : A −→ Y is any continuous map, then the pushout Y ∪f X is compactly generated.

Another source of pathology is passage to colimits over sequences of maps Xi −→ Xi+1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">J. Peter May 48</a>)</p>
Proposition. If {Xi } is a sequence of compactly generated spaces and inclusions Xi −→ Xi+1 with closed images, then colim Xi is compactly generated. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Limits of weak Hausdorff spaces are weak Hausdorff, but limits of k-spaces need not be k-spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We construct limits of compactly generated spaces by applying the functor k to their limits as spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Point-set level colimits of weak Hausdorff spaces need not be weak Hausdorff (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">J. Peter May 48</a>)</p>
However, if a point-set level colimit of compactly generated spaces is weak Hausdorff, then it is a k-space and therefore compactly generated.

The theories of cofiber and fiber sequences illustrate an important, but informal, duality theory, known as Eckmann-Hilton duality (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">J. Peter May 51</a>)</p>
It is based on the adjunction between Cartesian products and function spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">J. Peter May 51</a>)</p>
Definition. A map i : A −→ X is a cofibration if it satisfies the homotopy extension property (HEP). This means that if h ◦ i0 = f ◦ i in the diagram (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">J. Peter May 51</a>)</p>
Pushouts of cofibrations are cofibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">J. Peter May 51</a>)</p>
Namely, we can let Y in our original test diagram be the “mapping cylinder (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=52" target="_blank">J. Peter May 52</a>)</p>
As a matter of point-set topology, left as an exercise, it follows that a cofibration is an inclusion with closed image. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=52" target="_blank">J. Peter May 52</a>)</p>
M i ≡ X ∪i (A × I), which is the pushout of i and (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=52" target="_blank">J. Peter May 52</a>)</p>
We can use the mapping cylinder construction to decompose an arbitrary map f : X −→ Y as the composite of a cofibration and a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=53" target="_blank">J. Peter May 53</a>)</p>
To see this, recall that M f = Y ∪f (X × I) and observe that f coincides with the composite X j − → Mf r r − → Y, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=53" target="_blank">J. Peter May 53</a>)</p>
where j(x) = (x, 1) and where r(y) = y on Y and r(x, s) = f (x) on X × I. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=53" target="_blank">J. Peter May 53</a>)</p>
We shall often consider pairs (X, A) consisting of a space X and a subspace A. Cofibration pairs will be those pairs that “behave homologically” just like the associated quotient spaces X/A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=53" target="_blank">J. Peter May 53</a>)</p>
Definition. A pair (X, A) is an NDR-pair (= neighborhood deformation retract pair) if there is a map u : X −→ I such that u−1 (0) = A and a homotopy h : X × I −→ X such that h0 = id, h(a, t) = a for a ∈ A and t ∈ I, and h(x, 1) ∈ A if u(x) < 1; (X, A) is a DR-pair if u(x) < 1 for all x ∈ X, in which case A is a deformation retract of X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=53" target="_blank">J. Peter May 53</a>)</p>
Theorem. Let A be a closed subspace of X. Then the following are equivalent: (i) (X, A) is an NDR-pair. (ii) (X × I, X × {0} ∪ A × I) is a DR-pair. (iii) X × {0} ∪ A × I is a retract of X × I. (iv) The inclusion i : A −→ X is a cofibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=53" target="_blank">J. Peter May 53</a>)</p>
It is often important to work in the category of spaces under a given space A, and we shall later need a basic result about homotopy equivalences in this category. We shall also need a generalization concerning homotopy equivalences of pairs. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">J. Peter May 54</a>)</p>
A homotopy between maps under A is a homotopy that at each time t is a map under A. We then write h : f ≃ f ′ rel A (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">J. Peter May 54</a>)</p>
A. Such an equivalence is called a “cofiber homotopy equivalence.” The name is suggested by the following result, whose proof illustrates a more substantial use of the HEP than we have seen before (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">J. Peter May 54</a>)</p>
Proposition. Let i : A −→ X and j : A −→ Y be cofibrations and let f : X −→ Y be a map such that f ◦i = j. Suppose that f is a homotopy equivalence. Then f is a cofiber homotopy equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">J. Peter May 54</a>)</p>
Definition. A surjective map p : E −→ B is a fibration if it satisfies the covering homotopy property (CHP) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">J. Peter May 57</a>)</p>
This notion of a fibration is due to Hurewicz. There is a more general notion of a Serre fibration, in which the test spaces Y are restricted to be cubes I n . Serre fibrations are more appropriate for many purposes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">J. Peter May 57</a>)</p>
With this formulation, we can “dualize” the proof that pushouts of cofibrations are cofibrations to show that pullbacks of fibrations are fibrations. We often write A ×g E for the pullback of a given fibration p : E −→ B and a map g : A −→ B. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">J. Peter May 57</a>)</p>
Lemma. If p : E −→ B is a fibration and g : A −→ B is any map, then the induced map A ×g E −→ A is a fibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">J. Peter May 57</a>)</p>
Although the CHP is expressed in terms of general test diagrams, there is a certain universal test diagram. Namely, we can let Y in our original test diagram be the “mapping path space” N p ≡ E ×p B I = {(e, β)|β(0) = p(e)} ⊂ E × B I . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">J. Peter May 57</a>)</p>
In general, path lifting functions are not unique. In fact, we have already studied the special kinds of fibrations for which they are unique. Lemma. If p : E −→ B is a covering, then p is a fibration with a unique path lifting function s. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=58" target="_blank">J. Peter May 58</a>)</p>
A map s : N p −→ E I such that k ◦ s = id, where k : E I −→ N p has coordinates p0 and pI , is called a path lifting function (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=58" target="_blank">J. Peter May 58</a>)</p>
Lemma. If i : A −→ X is a cofibration and B is a space, then the induced map p = B i : B X −→ B A is a fibration. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=58" target="_blank">J. Peter May 58</a>)</p>
We can use the mapping path space construction to decompose an arbitrary map f : X −→ Y as the composite of a homotopy equivalence and a fibration. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=58" target="_blank">J. Peter May 58</a>)</p>
When restricted to the spaces U in a well chosen open cover O of the base space B, a covering is homeomorphic to the projection U × F −→ U , where F is a fixed discrete set (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">J. Peter May 59</a>)</p>
The obvious generalization of this is the notion of a bundle. A map p : E −→ B is a bundle if, when restricted to the spaces U in a well chosen open cover O of B, there are homeomorphisms φ : U × F −→ p−1 (U ) such that p ◦ φ = π1 , where F is a fixed topological space. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">J. Peter May 59</a>)</p>
that every bundle is a fibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">J. Peter May 59</a>)</p>
Theorem. Let p : E −→ B be a map and let O be a numerable open cover of B. Then p is a fibration if and only if p : p−1 (U ) −→ U is a fibration for every U ∈ O. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">J. Peter May 59</a>)</p>
Since pullbacks of fibrations are fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">J. Peter May 59</a>)</p>
B. A space over B is a map p : E −→ B. A map of spaces over B is a commutative diagram (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=60" target="_blank">J. Peter May 60</a>)</p>
A homotopy between maps over B is a homotopy that at each time t is a map over B. There results a notion of a homotopy equivalence over B. Such an equivalence is called a “fiber homotopy equivalence.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=60" target="_blank">J. Peter May 60</a>)</p>
Proposition. Let p : D −→ B and q : E −→ B be fibrations and let f : D −→ E be a map such that q ◦ f = p. Suppose that f is a homotopy equivalence. Then f is a fiber homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=60" target="_blank">J. Peter May 60</a>)</p>
Translation of fibers along paths in the base space played a fundamental role in our study of covering spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=61" target="_blank">J. Peter May 61</a>)</p>
Theorem. Lifting of equivalence classes of paths in B to homotopy classes of maps of fibers specifies a functor λ : Π(B) −→ hU . Therefore, if B is path connected, then any two fibers of B are homotopy equivalent. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=62" target="_blank">J. Peter May 62</a>)</p>
Just as the fundamental group π1 (B, b) of the base space of a covering acts on the fiber Fb , so the fundamental group π1 (B, b) of the base space of a fibration acts “up to homotopy” on the fiber (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=62" target="_blank">J. Peter May 62</a>)</p>
The composite of homotopy equivalences is a homotopy equivalence, and composition defines a continuous product on Aut(X). With this product, Aut(X) is a “topological monoid,” namely a space with a continuous and associative multiplication with a two-sided identity element, but it is not a group. However, the path components of Aut(X) are the homotopy classes of homotopy equivalences of X, and these do form a group under composition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=62" target="_blank">J. Peter May 62</a>)</p>
Corollary. Lifting of equivalence classes of loops specifies a homomorphism π1 (B, b) −→ π0 (Aut(Fb )). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=62" target="_blank">J. Peter May 62</a>)</p>
We use cofibrations and fibrations in the category T of based spaces to generate two “exact sequences of spaces” from a given map of based spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">J. Peter May 65</a>)</p>
For based spaces X and Y , we let [X, Y ] denote the set of based homotopy classes of based maps X −→ Y . This set has a natural basepoint, namely the homotopy class of the constant map from X to the basepoint of Y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">J. Peter May 65</a>)</p>
The appropriate analogue of the Cartesian product in the category of based spaces is the “smash product” X ∧ Y defined by X ∧ Y = X × Y /X ∨ Y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">J. Peter May 65</a>)</p>
With these definitions, we have a natural homeomorphism of based spaces F (X ∧ Y, Z) ∼ = ∼ = F (X, F (Y, Z)) for based spaces X and Y . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">J. Peter May 65</a>)</p>
We define the cone on X to be CX = X ∧ I, where I is given the basepoint 1. That is, CX = X × I/({∗} × I ∪ X × {1}). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">J. Peter May 65</a>)</p>
We view S 1 as I/∂I, denote its basepoint by 1, and define the suspension of X to be ΣX = X ∧ S 1 . That is, ΣX = X × S 1 /({∗} × S 1 ∪ X × {1}). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">J. Peter May 65</a>)</p>
These are sometimes called the reduced cone and suspension, to distinguish them from the unreduced constructions, in which the line {∗} × I through the basepoint of X is not identified to a point (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">J. Peter May 65</a>)</p>
Dually, we define the path space of X to be P X = F (I, X), where I is given the basepoint 0. Thus the points of P X are the paths in X that start at the basepoint. We define the loop space of X to be ΩX = F (S 1 , X). Its points are the loops at the basepoint. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=66" target="_blank">J. Peter May 66</a>)</p>
We have the adjunction F (ΣX, Y ) ∼ = ∼ = F (X, ΩY ). Passing to π0 , this gives that [ΣX, Y ] ∼ = ∼ = [X, ΩY ]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=66" target="_blank">J. Peter May 66</a>)</p>
Lemma. [ΣX, Y ] is a group and [Σ2 X, Y ] is an Abelian group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=66" target="_blank">J. Peter May 66</a>)</p>
We say that X is “nondegenerately based,” or “well pointed,” if the inclusion of its basepoint is a cofibration in the unbased sense. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=66" target="_blank">J. Peter May 66</a>)</p>
Write Y+ for the union of a space Y and a disjoint basepoint and observe that we can identify X ∧ Y+ with X × Y /{∗} × Y . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=66" target="_blank">J. Peter May 66</a>)</p>
The space X ∧ I+ is called the reduced cylinder on X, and a based homotopy X × I −→ Y is the same thing as a based map X ∧ I+ −→ Y . We change notations and write M f for the based mapping cylinder Y ∪f (X ∧ I+ ) of a based map (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=66" target="_blank">J. Peter May 66</a>)</p>
As in the unbased case, we conclude that a based map i : A −→ X is a cofibration if and only if M i is a retract of X ∧ I+ . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For a based map f : X −→ Y , define the “homotopy cofiber” Cf to be Cf = Y ∪f CX = M f /j(X), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let i : Y −→ Cf be the inclusion. It is a cofibration since it is the pushout of f and the cofibration X −→ CX that sends x to (x, 0) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

These “long exact sequences of based spaces” give rise to long exact sequences of pointed sets, where a sequence S ′ f − →S g → S − ′′ of pointed sets is said to be exact if g(s) = ∗ if and only if s = f (s′ ) for some s (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. For any based space Z, the induced sequence · · · −→ [ΣCf, Z] −→ [ΣY, Z] −→ [ΣX, Z] −→ [Cf, Z] −→ [Y, Z] −→ [X, Z] is an exact sequence of pointed sets, or of groups to the left of [ΣX, Z], or of Abelian groups to the left of [Σ2 X, Z].

For a based map f : X −→ Y , define the “homotopy fiber” F f to be F f = X ×f P Y = {(x, χ)|f (x) = χ(1)} ⊂ X × P Y.

For any based space Z, the induced sequence · · · −→ [Z, ΩF f ] −→ [Z, ΩX] −→ [Z, ΩY ] −→ [Z, F f ] −→ [Z, X] −→ [Z, Y ] is an exact sequence of pointed sets, or of groups to the left of [Z, ΩY ], or of Abelian groups to the left of [Z, Ω2 Y ].

It is often useful to know that cofiber sequences and fiber sequences can be connected to one another. The adjunction between loops and suspension has “unit” and “counit” maps η : X −→ ΩΣX and ε : ΣΩX −→ X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For ∗ ∈ A ⊂ X, the (homotopy) fiber of the inclusion A −→ X may be identified with the space P (X; ∗, A) of paths in X that begin at the basepoint and end in A (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This is a group if n ≥ 2 and an Abelian group if n ≥ 3. Again, πn (X, A) = π0 (Ω n−1 P (X; ∗, A)). These are called relative homotopy groups. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Using φ∗ to identify π∗ F with π∗ (F p), we may rewrite the long exact sequence of the bottom row of the diagram as · · · −→ πn (F ) −→ πn (E) −→ πn (B) ∂ ∂ − → πn−1 (F ) −→ · · · −→ π0 (E) −→ {∗}.

Lemma. For all spaces X and Y and all n, πn (X × Y ) ∼ = ∼ = πn (X) × πn (Y ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">J. Peter May 75</a>)</p>
There are three standard bundles, called the Hopf bundles, that can be used to obtain a bit more information about the homotopy groups of spheres. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

That is, CP 1 = (C × C − {0})/(∼), where (z1 , z2 ) ∼ (λz1 , λz2 ) for complex numbers λ, z1 , and z2 . Write [z1 , z2 ] for the equivalence class of (z1 , z2 ). We obtain a homeomorphism CP 1 −→ S 2 by identifying S 2 with the one-point compactification of C and mapping [z1 , z2 ] to z2 /z1 if z1 6= 0 and to the point at ∞ if z1 = 0. The Hopf map η : S 3 −→ S 2 is specified by η(z1 , z2 ) = [z1 , z2 ], where S 3 is identified with the unit sphere in the complex plane C2 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Since we have complete information on the homotopy groups of S 1 , the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated to η has the following direct consequence. Lemma. π2 (S 2 ) = ∼ = Z and πn (S ∼ 3 ) ∼ = ∼ = πn (S 2 ) for n ≥ 3. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It is left as an exercise to show that the long exact sequence associated to ν implies that π7 (S 4 ) contains an element of infinite order, and σ can be used similarly to show the same for π15 (S 8 ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">J.

In fact, the homotopy groups πq (S n ) for q > n > 1 are all finite except for π4n−1 (S 2n ), which is the direct sum of Z and a finite group. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">J. Peter May 75</a>)</p>
The difficulty of computing homotopy groups is well illustrated by the fact that there is no non-contractible simply connected compact manifold (or finite CW complex) all of whose homotopy groups are known. We shall find many non-compact spaces whose homotopy groups we can determine completely (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma. If X is the colimit of a sequence of inclusions Xi −→ Xi+1 of based spaces, then the natural map colimi πn (Xi ) −→ πn (X) is an isomorphism for each n.

Corollary. A homotopy equivalence of spaces or of pairs of spaces induces an isomorphism on all homotopy groups. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. A map e : Y −→ Z is an n-equivalence if, for all y ∈ Y , the map e∗ : πq (Y, y) −→ πq (Z, e(y)) is an injection for q < n and a surjection for q ≤ n; e is said to be a weak equivalence if it is an n-equivalence for all n.

Observe that πn+1 (X, x) can be viewed as the set of relative homotopy classes of maps (CS n , S n ) −→ (X, x). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It gives a useful criterion for determining when a given map is an n-equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=77" target="_blank">J. Peter May 77</a>)</p>
We introduce a large class of spaces, called CW complexes, between which a weak equivalence is necessarily a homotopy equivalence. Thus, for such spaces, the homotopy groups are, in a sense, a complete set of invariants. Moreover, we shall see that every space is weakly equivalent to a CW complex (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

iv) A map of pairs f : (X, A) −→ (Y, B) between relative CW complexes is said to be “cellular” if f (X n ) ⊂ Y n for all n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Of course, pushouts and unions are understood in the topological sense, with the compactly generated topologies. A subspace of X is closed if and only if its intersection with each X n is closed.

(ii) Via a homeomorphism I × I ∼ = ∼ = D2 , the standard presentations of the torus T = S × S , the projective plane RP 2 , and the Klein bottle K as quotients of a 1 1 square display these spaces as CW complexes with one or two vertices, two edges, and one 2-cell: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma. If (X, A) is a relative CW complex, then the quotient space X/A is a CW complex with a vertex corresponding to A and one n-cell for each relative n-cell of (X, A).

Lemma. If A is a subcomplex of a CW complex X, Y is a CW complex, and f : A −→ Y is a cellular map, then the pushout Y ∪f X is a CW complex that contains Y as a subcomplex and has one cell for each cell of X that is not in A. The quotient complex (Y ∪f X)/Y is isomorphic to X/A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma. The colimit of a sequence of inclusions of subcomplexes Xn −→ Xn+1 in CW complexes is a CW complex that contains each of the Xi as a subcomplex. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">J. Peter May 82</a>)</p>
In particular, if we take e to be the identity map of Y , we see that the inclusion A −→ X is a cofibration. Observe that, by passage to colimits, we are free to take n = ∞ in the theorem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">J.

Theorem (Whitehead). If X is a CW complex and e : Y −→ Z is an nequivalence, then e∗ : [X, Y ] −→ [X, Z] is a bijection if dim X < n and a surjection if dim X = n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">J.

Theorem (Whitehead). An n-equivalence between CW complexes of dimension less than n is a homotopy equivalence. A weak equivalence between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">J. Peter May 84</a>)</p>
If X is a finite CW complex, in the sense that it has finitely many cells, and if dim X > 1 and X is not contractible, then it is known that X has infinitely many non-zero homotopy groups. The Whitehead theorem is thus surprisingly strong: in its first statement, if low dimensional homotopy groups are mapped isomorphically, then so are all higher homotopy groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">J. Peter May 84</a>)</p>
Fortunately, any map between CW complexes is homotopic to a cellular map (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">J. Peter May 84</a>)</p>
Definition. A space X is said to be n-connected if πq (X, x) = 0 for 0 ≤ q ≤ n and all x. A pair (X, A) is said to be n-connected if π0 (A) −→ π0 (X) is surjective and πq (X, A, a) = 0 for 1 ≤ q ≤ n and all a. It is equivalent that the inclusion A −→ X be an n-equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma. A relative CW complex (X, A) with no m-cells for m ≤ n is nconnected. In particular, (X, X n ) is n-connected for any CW complex X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Cellular approximation). Any map f : (X, A) −→ (Y, B) between relative CW complexes is homotopic relative to A to a cellular map. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. For CW complexes X and Y , any map X −→ Y is homotopic to a cellular map, and any two homotopic cellular maps are cellularly homotopic. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Approximation by CW complexes). For any space X, there is a CW complex ΓX and a weak equivalence γ : ΓX −→ X. For a map f : X −→ Y and another such CW approximation γ : ΓY −→ Y , there is a map Γf : ΓX −→ ΓY , unique up to homotopy, such that the following diagram is homotopy commutative (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If X is n-connected, n ≥ 1, then ΓX can be chosen to have a unique vertex and no q-cells for 1 ≤ q ≤ n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A triad (X; A, B) is said to be excisive if X is the union of the interiors of A and B. Such triads play a fundamental role in homology and cohomology theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A CW triad (X; A, B) is a CW complex X with subcomplexes A and B such that X = A ∪ B. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">J. Peter May 87</a>)</p>
Define the double mapping cylinder M (i, j) = A ∪ (C × I) ∪ B (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">J. Peter May 88</a>)</p>

Lemma. For a cofibration i : C −→ A and any map j : C −→ B, the quotient map q : M (i, j) −→ A ∪C B is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">J. Peter May 88</a>)</p>
Because i is a cofibration, the retraction r : M i −→ A is a cofiber homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

That is, there is a homotopy inverse map and a pair of homotopies under C. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">J. Peter May 88</a>)</p>
The fundamental obstruction to the calculation of homotopy groups is the failure of excision: for an excisive triad (X; A, B), the inclusion (A, A ∩ B) −→ (X, B) fails to induce an isomorphism of homotopy groups in general (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=91" target="_blank">J. Peter May 91</a>)</p>
However, we do have such an isomorphism in a range of dimensions. This implies the Freudenthal suspension theorem, which gives that πn+q (Σn X) is independent of n if q is small relative to n (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Homotopy excision). Let (X; A, B) be an excisive triad such that C = A ∩ B is non-empty. Assume that (A, C) is (m − 1)-connected and (B, C) is (n − 1)-connected, where m ≥ 2 and n ≥ 1. Then the inclusion (A, C) −→ (X, B) is an (m + n − 2)-equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=91" target="_blank">J. Peter May 91</a>)</p>
This specializes to give a relationship between the homotopy groups of pairs (X, A) and of quotients X/A and to prove the Freudenthal suspension theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Let f : X −→ Y be an (n−1)-equivalence between (n−2)-connected spaces, where n ≥ 2; thus πn−1 (f ) is an epimorphism. Then the quotient map π : (M f, X) −→ (Cf, ∗) is a (2n − 2)-equivalence. In particular, Cf is (n − 1)connected. If X and Y are (n − 1)-connected, then π : (M f, X) −→ (Cf, ∗) is a (2n − 1)-equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. Let f : X −→ Y be a based map between (n − 1)-connected nondegenerately based spaces, where n ≥ 2. Then Cf is (n − 1)-connected and πn (M f, X) −→ πn (Cf, ∗) is an isomorphism. Moreover, the canonical map η : F f −→ ΩCf induces an isomorphism πn−1 (F f ) −→ πn (Cf ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Let i : A −→ X be a cofibration and an (n − 1)-equivalence between (n − 2)-connected spaces, where n ≥ 2. Then the quotient map (X, A) −→ (X/A, ∗) is a (2n − 2)-equivalence, and it is a (2n − 1)-equivalence if A and X are (n − 1)connected. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A specialization of the last result gives the Freudenthal suspension theorem. For a based space X, define the suspension homomorphism Σ : πq (X) −→ πq+1 (ΣX) by letting Σf = f ∧ id : S q+1 ∼ = ∼ = S q ∧ S 1 −→ X ∧ S 1 = ΣX. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Freudenthal suspension). Assume that X is nondegenerately based and (n − 1)-connected, where n ≥ 1. Then Σ is a bijection if q < 2n − 1 and a surjection if q = 2n − 1.

Theorem. For all n ≥ 1, πn (S n ) = Z and Σ : πn (S n ) −→ πn+1 (S n+1 ) is an isomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We saw by use of the Hopf bundle S 3 −→ S 2 that π2 (S 2 ) = Z, and the suspension theorem applies to give the conclusion for n ≥ 2. A little extra argument is needed to check that Σ is an isomorphism for n = 1; one can inspect the connecting homomorphism of the Hopf bundle or refer ahead to the observation that the Hurewicz homomorphism commutes with the corresponding suspension isomorphism in homology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">J. Peter May 93</a>)</p>
The dimensional range of the suspension theorem is sharp. We saw before that π3 (S 2 ) = π3 (S 3 ), which is Z. The suspension theorem applies to show that Σ : π3 (S 2 ) −→ π4 (S 3 ) is an epimorphism, and it is known that π4 (S 3 ) = Z2 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Applying suspension repeatedly, we can form a colimit π s qs (X) = colim πq+n (Σ n X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">J. Peter May 93</a>)</p>
This group is called the qth stable homotopy group of X. For q < n − 1, the maps of the colimit system are isomorphisms and therefore π s qs (X) = πq+n (Σ n X) if q < n − 1.

The calculation of the stable homotopy groups of spheres, πqs qs (S 0 ), is one of the deepest and most studied problems in algebraic topology. Important problems of geometric topology, such as the enumeration of the distinct differential structures on S q for q ≥ 5, have been reduced to the determination of these groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

3. Proof of the homotopy excision theorem This is a deep result, and it is remarkable that a direct homotopical proof, in principle an elementary one, is possible.

We are trying to show that a certain map of pairs induces an isomorphism in a range of dimensions.

An element of the kernel of di is called a cycle and an element of the image of di+1 is called a boundary. We say that two cycles are “homologous” if their difference is a boundary.

for the submodules of boundaries and cycles, respectively, and we define the ith homology group Hi (X) to be the quotient module Zi (X)/Bi (X). We write H∗ (X) for the sequence of Rmodules Hi (X).

Define a chain complex I by letting I0 be the free Abelian group with two generators [0] and [1], letting I1 be the free Abelian group with one generator [I] such that d([I]) = [0] − [1], and letting Ii = 0 for all other i.

A sequence M ′ f − →M g g → M ′′ of modules is exact if im f = ker g. If M ′ = 0, this − means that g is a monomorphism; if M ′′ = 0, it means that f is an epimorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. A short exact sequence of chain complexes naturally gives rise to a long exact sequence of R-modules · · · −→ Hq (X ′ ) f f∗ −→ Hq (X) g g∗ −→ Hq (X ′′ ) ∂ ∂ − → Hq−1 (X ′ ) −→ · · · .

We define the “connecting homomorphism” ∂ : Hq (X ′′ ) −→ Hq−1 (X ′ ) by ∂[x′′ ] = [x′ ], where f (x′ ) = d(x) for some x such that g(x) = x′′ . There is such an x since g is an epimorphism, and there is such an x′ since gd(x) = dg(x) = 0. It is a standard exercise in “diagram chasing” to verify that ∂ is well defined and the sequence is exact (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let 0 −→ π f − →ρ g − → σ −→ 0 be an exact sequence of Abelian groups and let C be a chain complex of flat (= torsion free) Abelian groups. Write H∗ (C; π) = H∗ (C ⊗ π). Construct a natural long exact sequence · · · −→ Hq (C; π) f f∗ −→ Hq (C; ρ) g g∗ −→ Hq (C; σ) β − → Hq−1 (C; π) −→ · · · . The connecting homomorphism β is called a Bockstein operation.

Unlike homotopy groups, these are stable invariants, the same for a space and its suspension, and it is this that makes them computable. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Fix an Abelian group π and consider pairs of spaces (X, A). We shall see that π determines a “homology theory on pairs (X, A).” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Clearly, up to canonical isomorphism, this construction of a homology theory on pairs of spaces is independent of the choice of our CW approximation functor Γ. The reader may have seen singular homology before. As we shall explain later, the classical construction of singular homology amounts to a choice of a particularly nice CW approximation functor, one that is actually functorial on the point-set level, before passage to homotopy categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let X be a CW complex. We shall define the cellular chain complex C∗ (X). We let Cn (X) be the free Abelian group with one generator [j] for each n-cell j. We must define a differential dn : Cn (X) −→ Cn−1 (X) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It will be convenient to work with unreduced cones, cofibers, and suspensions in this section; that is, we do not choose basepoints and so we do not collapse out lines through basepoints (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We still have the basic result that if i : A −→ X is a cofibration, then collapsing the cone on A to a point gives a homotopy equivalence ψ : Ci −→ X/A.

Our first definition of dn involves the calculation of the degrees of maps between spheres (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

However, there are three models of S n that are needed in our discussion: the standard sphere S n ⊂ Dn+1 , the quotient Dn /S n−1 , and the (unreduced) suspension ΣS n−1 . We must fix suitably compatible homeomorphisms relating these “n-spheres.” We define a homeomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We have dealt so far with the case of integral homology. For more general coefficient groups π, we define C∗ (X, A; π) = C∗ (X, A) ⊗ π (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A nice fact about cellular homology is that the definition leads directly to an algebraic procedure for the calculation of the homology of Cartesian products (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. If X and Y are CW complexes, then X × Y is a CW complex such that C∗ (X × Y ) ∼ = ∼ = C∗ (X) ⊗ C∗ (Y ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We define an isomorphism of graded Abelian groups κ : C∗ (X) ⊗ C∗ (Y ) −→ C∗ (X × Y ) by setting κ([i] ⊗ [j]) = (−1) pq [i × j]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Cellular chains make some computations quite trivial. For example, since S n is a CW complex with one vertex and one n-cell, we see immediately that ̃ H̃n (S n ; π) ∼ = ∼ =π and ̃ H̃q (S n ; π) = 0 for q 6= n.

if we look back at the CW decompositions of the torus T , the projective plane RP 2 , and the Klein bottle K and if we let j denote the unique 2-cell in each case, then we find the following descriptions of the cellular chains and integral homologies by quick direct inspections (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

While homology groups are far easier to compute than homotopy groups, direct chain level calculation is seldom the method of choice. Rather, one uses chains as a tool for developing more sophisticated algebraic techniques, notably spectral sequences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We give an illustration that both shows that chain level calculations are sometimes practicable even when there are many non-zero differentials to determine and indicates why one might not wish to attempt such calculations for really complicated spaces.

The nth integral homology group of such a manifold M is Z if M is orientable and zero if M is not orientable. The nth mod 2 homology group of M is Z2 whether or not M is orientable.

A “generalized homology theory” E∗ is defined to be a system of functors Eq (X, A) and natural transformations ∂ : Eq (X, A) −→ Eq−1 (A) that satisfy all of our axioms except for the dimension axiom.

One of the themes of this chapter is the relationship between homology theories on pairs of spaces and reduced homology theories on based spaces. The latter are more convenient in most advanced work in algebraic topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=115" target="_blank">J. Peter May 115</a>)</p>
For a based space X, we define the reduced homology of X to be ̃ Ẽq (X) = Eq (X, ∗). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=115" target="_blank">J. Peter May 115</a>)</p>
Since the basepoint is a retract of X, there results a direct sum decomposition E∗ (X) ∼ = ∼ = E ̃ Ẽ∗ (X) ⊕ E∗ (∗) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=115" target="_blank">J. Peter May 115</a>)</p>
the exactness axiom implies that there is a reduced long exact sequence · · · −→ E ̃ Ẽq (A) −→ E ̃ Ẽq (X) −→ Eq (X, A) ∂ ∂ − → E ̃ Ẽq−1 (A) −→ · · · .

We can obtain the unreduced homology groups as special cases of the reduced ones. For an unbased space X, we define a based space X+ by adjoining a disjoint basepoint to X. By the additivity axiom, we see immediately that E∗ (X) = E ̃ Ẽ∗ (X+ ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=115" target="_blank">J. Peter May 115</a>)</p>
In fact, the unreduced cone on a space Y coincides with the reduced cone on Y+ : the line through the disjoint basepoint is identified to the cone point when constructing the reduced cone on Y+ . Therefore the unreduced cofiber of an unbased map f coincides with the reduced cofiber of the based map f+ . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=116" target="_blank">J. Peter May 116</a>)</p>
The observant reader will have noticed that the unreduced suspension of X is not the reduced suspension on X+ . Rather, under either interpretation of suspension, Σ(X+ ) is homotopy equivalent to the wedge of Σ(X) and a circle. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

a special case of the reduced homology of spaces. Theorem. For any cofibration i : A −→ X, the quotient map q : (X, A) −→ (X/A, ∗) induces an isomorphism E∗ (X, A) −→ E∗ (X/A, ∗) = E ̃ Ẽ∗ (X/A). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=116" target="_blank">J.

Recall that a basepoint ∗ ∈ X is nondegenerate if the inclusion {∗} −→ X is a cofibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This ensures that the inclusion of the line through the basepoint in the unreduced suspension of X is a cofibration, so that the map from the unreduced suspension to the suspension that collapses out the line through the basepoint is a homotopy equivalence.

Theorem. For a nondegenerately based space X, there is a natural isomorphism Σ : E ̃ Ẽq (X) ∼ = ∼ = E ̃ Ẽq+1 (ΣX). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. For any n and q, ̃ Ẽq (S n ) ∼ = ∼ = Eq−n (∗). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=117" target="_blank">J. Peter May 117</a>)</p>
In the study of generalized homology theories, it is most convenient to restrict attention to reduced homology theories defined on nondegenerately based spaces.

Definition. A reduced homology theory ̃ Ẽ∗ consists of functors ̃ Ẽq from the homotopy category of nondegenerately based spaces to the category of Abelian groups that satisfy the following axioms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For the additivity axiom, we note that the cofiber of a disjoint union of maps is the wedge of the cofibers of the given maps (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The first is the long exact sequence of a triple (X, A, B) of spaces B ⊂ A ⊂ X, which is just like its analogue for homotopy groups. Proposition. For a triple (X, A, B), the following sequence is exact: · · · −→ Eq (A, B) i i −→∗ Eq (X, B) j j∗ −→ Eq (X, A) ∂ ∂ − → Eq−1 (A, B) −→ · · · . Here i : (A, B) −→ (X, B) and j : (X, B) −→ (X, A) are inclusions and ∂ is the composite Eq (X, A) ∂ ∂ − → Eq−1 (A) −→ Eq−1 (A, B). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Mayer-Vietoris sequence). Let (X; A, B) be an excisive triad and set C = A ∩ B. The following sequence is exact: · · · −→ Eq (C) ψ − → Eq (A) ⊕ Eq (B) φ − → Eq (X) ∆ ∆ −→ Eq−1 (C) −→ · · · .

Alternatively, one can use CW approximation. For a CW triad, there is a short exact sequence 0 −→ C∗ (C) −→ C∗ (A) ⊕ C∗ (B) −→ C∗ (X) −→ 0 whose associated long exact sequence is the Mayer-Vietoris sequence.

We have seen that the compactness of spheres S n and cylinders S n × I implies that, for any choice of basepoint in X0 , the natural map colim π∗ (Xi ) −→ π∗ (X) is an isomorphism. We shall use the additivity and weak equivalence axioms and the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to prove the analogue for homology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We record an algebraic description of the colimit of a sequence for use in the proof. Lemma. Let fi : Ai −→ Ai+1 be a sequence of homomorphisms of Abelian groups. Then there is a short exact sequence s a short 0 −→ i Ai ct seq − → i Ai β − → colim Ai −→ 0, where α(ai ) = ai − fi (ai ) for ai ∈ Ai and the restriction of β to Ai is the canonical map given by the definition of a colimit (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The proof makes use of a useful general construction called the “telescope” of the Xi , denoted tel Xi (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Inductively, let Y0 = X0 × {0} and suppose that we have constructed Yi ⊃ Xi × {i}. Define Yi+1 to be the double mapping cylinder Yi ∪ Mi+1 obtained by identifying (x, i) ∈ Yi with (x, i) ∈ Mi+1 for x ∈ Xi . Define tel Xi to be the union of the Yi , with the colimit topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Remark. There is a general theory of “homotopy colimits,” which are up to homotopy versions of colimits. The telescope is the homotopy colimit of a sequence. The double mapping cylinder that we used in approximating excisive triads by CW triads is the homotopy pushout of a diagram of the shape • ←− • −→ •. We implicitly used homotopy coequalizers in constructing CW approximations of spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. For based spaces X, define the Hurewicz homomorphism h : πn (X) −→ H ̃ H̃n (X) by h([f ]) = f∗ (in ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Here the groups on the left are defined in terms of homotopy groups and were used in our construction of cellular chains, while the groups on the right are those of our given homology theory. We use the groups on the right to construct cellular chains in our given theory, and we find that the isomorphism is compatible with differentials (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Thus let X be a CW complex. For each integer n, define Cn (X) = Hn (X n , X n−1 ) ∼ = ∼ = H ̃ H̃n (X n /X n−1 ).

Theorem. There is a natural isomorphism H∗ (X, A) ∼ = ∼ = H∗ (C∗ (X, A)) under which the natural transformation ∂ agrees with the natural transformation induced by the connecting homomorphisms associated to the short exact sequences 0 −→ C∗ (A) −→ C∗ (X) −→ C∗ (X, A) −→ 0.

By the dimension and additivity axioms, we know the homology of wedges of spheres (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">J. Peter May 128</a>)</p>
(Hint: construct M (π, n) as the cofiber of a map between wedges of spheres.) The spaces M (π, n) are called Moore spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

(Hint: start with M (π, n), using the Hurewicz theorem, and kill its higher homotopy groups.) The spaces K(π, n) are called Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

There are “face maps” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=131" target="_blank">J. Peter May 131</a>)</p>

A map f : ∆n −→ X is called a singular n-simplex (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=132" target="_blank">J. Peter May 132</a>)</p>
The singular homology of X is usually defined in terms of this chain complex: H∗ (X; π) = H∗ (C∗ (X) ⊗ π). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=132" target="_blank">J. Peter May 132</a>)</p>
We define a space ΓX, called the “geometric realization of the total singular complex of X,” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=132" target="_blank">J. Peter May 132</a>)</p>
We may define the geometric realization |K∗ | of general simplicial sets exactly as we defined the geometric realization ΓX = |S∗ X| of the total singular complex of a topological space. In fact, the total singular complex and geometric realization functors are adjoint (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=134" target="_blank">J. Peter May 134</a>)</p>
One can define a simplicial object in any category C as a sequence of objects Kn of C connected by face and degeneracy maps in C that satisfy the commutation relations that we have displayed. Thus we have simplicial groups, simplicial Abelian groups, simplicial spaces, and so forth. We can think of simplicial sets as discrete simplicial spaces, and we then see that geometric realization generalizes directly to a functor | − | from the category S U of simplicial spaces to the category U of spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">J. Peter May 135</a>)</p>
We note one of the principal features of geometric realization (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">J. Peter May 135</a>)</p>
The projections induce maps of simplicial spaces from X∗ × Y∗ to X∗ and Y∗ . On passage to geometric realization, these give the coordinates of a map |X∗ × Y∗ | −→ |X∗ | × |Y∗ |. It turns out that this map is always a homeomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">J. Peter May 135</a>)</p>
Now restrict attention to simplicial sets K∗ and L∗ . Then the homeomorphism just specified is a map between CW complexes. However, it is not a cellular map; rather, it takes the n-skeleton of |K∗ × L∗ | to the 2n-skeleton of |K∗ | × |L∗ |. It is homotopic to a cellular map, no longer a homeomorphism, and there results a chain homotopy equivalence C∗ (|K∗ × L∗ |) −→ C∗ (|K∗ |) ⊗ C∗ (|L∗ |) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">J. Peter May 135</a>)</p>
In particular, for spaces X and Y , there is a natural chain homotopy equivalence from the singular chain complex C∗ (X × Y ) to the tensor product C∗ (X) ⊗ C∗ (Y ).

The space BG is called the classifying space of G (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=136" target="_blank">J. Peter May 136</a>)</p>
We may view Bn (G) as the orbit space En (G)/G. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=136" target="_blank">J. Peter May 136</a>)</p>
It is less intuitive, but true, that the space E(G) is contractible. By the long exact homotopy sequence, these facts imply that πq+1 (BG) ∼ = ∼ = πq (G) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=136" target="_blank">J. Peter May 136</a>)</p>
We illustrate these ideas by defining the “classifying spaces” and “universal bundles” associated to topological groups G (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This allows us to iterate the construction, setting B 0 (G) = G and B n (G) = B(B n−1 (G)) for n ≥ 1. Specializing to a discrete Abelian group π, we define K(π, n) = B n (π).

t is called a “transfer homomorphism.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=137" target="_blank">J. Peter May 137</a>)</p>
Indeed, if one focuses on singular chains, then one eschews chain level computations in principle as well as in practice. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We here recall some classical results in homological algebra that explain how to calculate H∗ (X; π) from H∗ (X) ≡ H∗ (X; Z) and how to calculate H∗ (X × Y ) from H∗ (X) ⊗ H∗ (Y ).

Recall that an R-module M is said to be flat if the functor M ⊗ N is exact (that is, preserves exact sequences in the variable N ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For a principal ideal domain (PID) R, the only torsion product is the first one, denoted Tor R 1 (M, N ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=139" target="_blank">J. Peter May 139</a>)</p>
It can be computed by constructing a short exact sequence 0 −→ F1 −→ F0 −→ M −→ 0 and tensoring with N to obtain an exact seqence 0 −→ Tor R 1 (M, N ) −→ F1 ⊗ N −→ F0 ⊗ N −→ M ⊗ N −→ 0, where F1 and F0 are free R-modules. That is, we choose an epimorphism F0 −→ M and note that, since R is a PID, its kernel F1 is also free. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Universal coefficient). Let R be a P ID and let X be a flat chain complex over R. Then, for each n, there is a natural short exact sequence 0 −→ Hn (X) ⊗ M α α − → Hn (X ⊗ M ) β → Tor − R 1 (Hn−1 (X), M ) −→ 0. The sequence splits, so that Hn (X ⊗ M ) ∼ = ∼ = (Hn (X) ⊗ M ) ⊕ Tor R 1 (Hn−1 (X), M ), but the splitting is not natural. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In Chapter 20 §3, we shall see an important class of examples in which the splitting is very far from being natural (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. If R is a field, then α : H∗ (X) ⊗ M −→ H∗ (X; M ) is a natural isomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

2. The Künneth theorem The universal coefficient theorem in homology is a special case of the Künneth theorem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Künneth). Let R be a P ID and let X be a flat chain complex and Y be any chain complex. Then, for each n, there is a natural short exact sequence Y be any c 0 −→ p+q=n Hp (X)⊗Hq (Y ) α α − → Hn (X⊗Y ) β , there is β −→ p+q=n−1 Tor R 1 (Hp (X), Hq (Y )) −→ 0. The sequence splits, so that Hn (X ⊗ Y ) ∼ = ∼ =( o t p+q=n Hp (X) ⊗ Hq (Y )) ⊕ ( p+q=n−1 Tor R 1 (Hp (X), Hq (Y ))), but the splitting is not natural. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. If R is a field, then α : H∗ (X) ⊗ H∗ (Y ) −→ H∗ (X ⊗ Y ) is a natural isomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Since all modules over a field are free and thus flat (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=141" target="_blank">J. Peter May 141</a>)</p>
. We assume that the reader has seen Ext modules, which measure the failure of Hom to be an exact functor. For a PID R, the only Ext module is the first one, denoted Ext1 R R (M, N ). It can be computed by constructing a short exact sequence 0 −→ F1 −→ F0 −→ M −→ 0 and applying Hom to obtain an exact seqence 0 −→ Hom(M, N ) −→ Hom(F0 , N ) −→ Hom(F1 , N ) −→ Ext1 R R (M, N ) −→ 0, where F1 and F0 are free R-modules (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Universal coefficient). Let R be a P ID and let X be a free chain complex over R. Then, for each n, there is a natural short exact sequence 0 −→ Ext1 R R (Hn−1 (X), M ) β − → H n (X; M ) α α − → Hom(Hn (X), M ) −→ 0. The sequence splits, so that H n (X; M ) ∼ = ∼ = Hom(Hn (X), M ) ⊕ Ext1 R R (Hn−1 (X), M ), but the splitting is not natural. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. If R is a field, then α : H ∗ (X; M ) −→ Hom(H∗ (X), M ) is a natural isomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Second, when R is a PID, a short exact sequence 0 −→ L ′ −→ L −→ L ′′ −→ 0 of R-modules gives rise to a six-term exact sequence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=143" target="_blank">J. Peter May 143</a>)</p>
For Rmodules L, M , and N , we have an adjunction Hom(L ⊗ M, N ) ∼ = ∼ = Hom(L, Hom(M, N )). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=144" target="_blank">J. Peter May 144</a>)</p>
We also have a natural homomorphism Hom(L, M ) ⊗ N −→ Hom(L, M ⊗ N ), and this is an isomorphism if either L or N is a finitely generated projective Rmodule (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=144" target="_blank">J. Peter May 144</a>)</p>
Again, we have a natural map Hom(L, M ) ⊗ Hom(L ′ , M ′ ) −→ Hom(L ⊗ L ′ , M ⊗ M ′ ), which is an isomorphism if L and L′ are finitely generated and projective or if L is finitely generated and projective and M = R.

For its flatness hypothesis, it is useful to remember that, for any Noetherian ring R, the dual Hom(F, R) of a free R-module is a flat R-module (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The essential new feature is the cup product structure that makes the cohomology of X with coefficients in a commutative ring R a commutative graded R-algebra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=145" target="_blank">J.

For general spaces X, we can use ΓX = |S∗ X| as a canonical CW approximation functor (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=146" target="_blank">J. Peter May 146</a>)</p>
By our observations about cochain complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=147" target="_blank">J. Peter May 147</a>)</p>
This product makes H ∗ (X; R) into a graded unital, associative, and “commutative” R-algebra. Here commutativity is understood in the appropriate graded sense (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=147" target="_blank">J. Peter May 147</a>)</p>
In both diagrams, τ (x ⊗ y) = (−1) pq y ⊗ x if deg x = p and deg y = q. The reason is that, on the topological level, t permutes p-cells past q-cells and, on the level of cellular chains, this involves the transposition S p+q = S p ∧ S q −→ S q ∧ S p = S p+q . We leave it as an exercise that this map has degree (−1)pq . It is this fact that forces the cup product to be commutative in the graded sense (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=148" target="_blank">J. Peter May 148</a>)</p>
In principle, the way to compute cup products is to pass to cellular chains from a cellular approximation to the diagonal map ∆. The point is that ∆ fails to be cellular since it carries the n-skeleton of X to the 2n-skeleton of X × X. In practice, this does not work very well and more indirect means of computation must be used. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

4. An example: RP n and the Borsuk-Ulam theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=148" target="_blank">J. Peter May 148</a>)</p>
We shall later use Poincaré duality to give a quick proof that the cohomology algebra H ∗ (RP n ; Z2 ) is a truncated polynomial algebra Z2 [x]/(xn+1 ), where deg x = 1. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=148" target="_blank">J. Peter May 148</a>)</p>
We use this fact together with covering space theory to prove a celebrated result known as the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. A map g : S m −→ S n is said to be antipodal if it takes pairs of antipodal points to pairs of antipodal points. It then induces a map f : RP m −→ RP n such that the following diagram commutes: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=149" target="_blank">J. Peter May 149</a>)</p>
Theorem. If m > n ≥ 1, then there exist no antipodal maps S m −→ S n . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=149" target="_blank">J. Peter May 149</a>)</p>
Theorem (Borsuk-Ulam). For any continuous map f : S n −→ Rn , there exists x ∈ S n such that f (x) = f (−x). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=149" target="_blank">J. Peter May 149</a>)</p>
Proof. Suppose for a contradiction that f (x) 6= f (−x) for all x. We could then define a continuous antipodal map g : S n −→ S n−1 by letting g(x) be the point at which the vector from 0 through f (x) − f (−x) intersects S n−1 .

We give an outline of one of the most striking features of cohomology: the cohomology groups of a space X with coefficients in the homotopy groups of a space Y control the construction of homotopy classes of maps X −→ Y . As a matter of motivation, this helps explain why one is interested in general coefficient groups. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. Fix n ≥ 1. A connected space X is said to be n-simple if π1 (X) is Abelian and acts trivially on the homotopy groups πq (X) for q ≤ n; X is said to be simple if it is n-simple for all n.

We ask when f can be extended to a map X n+1 −→ Y that restricts to the given map on A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If we compose the attaching maps S n → X of cells of X \ A with f , we obtain elements of πn (Y ). These elements specify a well defined “obstruction cocycle” cf ∈ C n+1 (X, A; πn (Y )).

Clearly, by considering extensions cell by cell, f extends to X n+1 if and only if cf = 0 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

considering extensions cell by cell, f extends to X n+1 if and only if cf = 0. This is not a computable criterion. However, if we allow ourselves to modify f a little, then we can refine the criterion to a cohomological one that often is computable. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. For f : X n −→ Y , the restriction of f to X n−1 extends to a map n+1 X → Y if and only if [cf ] = 0 in H n+1 (X, A; πn (Y )). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Given maps f, f ′ : X n → Y and a homotopy rel A of their restrictions to X n−1 , there is an obstruction class in H n (X, A; πn (Y )) that vanishes if and only if the restriction of the given homotopy to X n−2 extends to a homotopy f ≃ f ′ rel A.

Here, if i : (Y, C) −→ (Y, A), j : (Y, C) −→ (Y, B), k : (Y, A) −→ (Y, X), and ℓ : (Y, B) −→ (Y, X) are the inclusions, then φ ∗ (χ) = (k ∗ (χ), ℓ ∗ (χ)) and ψ ∗ (α, β) = i ∗ (α) − j ∗ (β) and ∆∗ is the composite E q−1 (Y, C) −→ E q−1 (A, C) ∼ = ∼ = E q−1 (X, B) δ δ − → E q (Y, X).

We shall use the additivity and weak equivalence axioms and the MayerVietoris sequence to explain how to compute E ∗ (X). The answer is more subtle than in homology because, algebraically, limits are less well behaved than colimits: they are not exact functors from diagrams of Abelian groups to Abelian groups.

That is, we may as well define lim 1 Ai to be the displayed cokernel. We then have the following result. Theorem. For each q, there is a natural short exact sequence 0 −→ lim 1 E q−1 (Xi ) −→ E q (X) π π − → lim E q (Xi ) −→ 0, where π is induced by the inclusions Xi −→ X.

Rather than go into the general theory, we simply display how the “first right derived functor” lim 1 of an inverse sequence of Abelian groups can be computed (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We say that an inverse sequence fi : Ai+1 −→ Ai satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition if, for each fixed i, there exists j ≥ i such that, for every k > j, the image of the composite Ak −→ Ai is equal to the image of the composite Aj −→ Ai . For example, this holds if all but finitely many of the fi are epimorphisms or if the Ai are all finite. As a matter of algebra, we have the following vanishing result. Lemma. If the inverse sequence fi : Ai+1 −→ Ai satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition, then lim 1 Ai = 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If we assume given a theory that satisfies the axioms, we see that the cochains with coefficients in π of a CW complex X can be redefined by C n (X; π) = H n (X n , X n−1 ; π), with differential d : C n (X; π) −→ C n+1 (X; π) the composite H n (X n , X n−1 ; π) −→ H n (X n ) δ δ − → H n+1 (X n+1 , X n ). That is, the following result holds. Theorem. C ∗ (X; π) as just defined is isomorphic to Hom(C∗ (X), π). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Cup products are “unstable,” in the sense that they vanish on suspensions. This is an indication of how much more information they carry than the mere additive groups. The proof given by this sequence of exercises actually applies to any “multiplicative” cohomology theory, that is, any theory that has suitable cup products (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Commentary: Additively, cohomology groups are “stable,” in the sense that ̃ H̃ p (Y ) ∼ = ∼ = H ̃ H̃ p+1 (ΣY ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It is apparent that there is a kind of duality relating the construction of homology and cohomology. In its simplest form, this is reflected by the fact that evaluation of cochains on chains gives a natural homomorphism C p (X; π) ⊗ Cp (X; ρ) −→ π ⊗ ρ. This passes to homology and cohomology to give an evaluation pairing H p (X; π) ⊗ Hp (X; ρ) −→ π ⊗ ρ. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

When R is a field and the Hp (X; R) are finite dimensional vector spaces, the adjoint of this pairing is an isomorphism H p (X; R) ∼ = ∼ = HomR (Hp (X; R), R).

That is, the cohomology groups of X are the vector space duals of the homology groups of X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We shall study manifolds without boundary in this chapter, turning to manifolds with boundary in the next. We do not assume that M is differentiable. It is known that M can be given the structure of a finite CW complex, and its homology and cohomology groups are therefore finitely generated. When M is differentiable, it is not hard to prove this using Morse theory, but it is a deep theorem in the general topological case (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If R is a field and M is “R-orientable,” then there is an “R-fundamental class” z ∈ Hn (M ; R). The composite of the cup product and evaluation on z gives a cup product pairing H p (M ; R) ⊗ H n−p (M ; R) −→ R. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

One version of the Poincaré duality theorem asserts that this pairing is nonsingular, so that its adjoint is an isomorphism H p (M ; R) = ∼ = HomR (H ∼ n−p (M ; R), R) ∼ = ∼ = Hn−p (M ; R).

Theorem (Poincaré duality). Let M be a compact R-oriented n-manifold. Then, for an R-module π, there is an isomorphism D : H p (M ; π) −→ Hn−p (M ; π).

Proposition. If M is a compact n-manifold, then an R-orientation of M determines and is determined by an R-fundamental class z ∈ Hn (M ; R). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. Let Tp ⊂ H p (M ) be the torsion subgroup. The cup product pairing α ⊗ β −→ hαβ, zi induces a nonsingular pairing H p (M )/Tp ⊗ H n−p (M )/Tn−p −→ Z.

Corollary. As a graded ring, H ∗ (CP n ) is the truncated polynomial algebra Z[α]/(αn+1 ), where deg α = 2. That is, H 2q (CP n ) is the free Abelian group with generator αq for 1 ≤ q ≤ n.

We shall see that an oriented manifold is R-oriented for any commutative ring R (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=161" target="_blank">J. Peter May 161</a>)</p>
a field. Then α ⊗ β −→ hα ∪ β, zi defines a nonsingular pairing H p (M ; R) ⊗R H n−p (M ; R) −→ R. We shall see that every manifold is Z2 -oriented, and an argument exactly like that for CP n allows us to compute the cup products in H ∗ (RP n ; Z2 ). We used this information in our proof of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. As a graded ring, H ∗ (RP n ; Z2 ) is the truncated polynomial algebra Z2 [α]/(α n+1 ), where deg α = 1. That is, α q is the non-zero element of H q (RP n ; Z2 ) for 1 ≤ q ≤ n.

Using the evident natural map from the tensor product of homologies to the homology of a tensor product, we see that ∩ passes to homology to induce a pairing ∩ : H ∗ (X; π) ⊗R H∗ (X; R) −→ H∗ (X; π).

Inspecting definitions, we see that, on elements, these observations prove the fundamental identity hα ∪ β, xi = hβ, α ∩ xi. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For use in the proof of the Poincaré duality theorem, we observe that the cap product generalizes to relative cap products (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We think of Hn (M, M − x) as a free R-module on one generator, but the generator (which corresponds to a unit of the ring R) is unspecified. Intuitively, an R-orientation of M is a consistent choice of generators. Definition. An R-fundamental class of M at a subspace X is an element z ∈ Hn (M, M − X) such that, for each x ∈ X, the image of z under the map Hn (M, M − X) −→ Hn (M, M − x) induced by the inclusion (M, M − X) −→ (M, M − x) is a generator. If X = M , we refer to z ∈ Hn (M ) as a fundamental class of M . An R-orientation of M is an open cover {Ui } and R-fundamental classes zi of M at Ui such that if Ui ∩ Uj is non-empty, then zi and zj map to the same element of Hn (M, M − Ui ∩ Uj ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=164" target="_blank">J.

We say that M is R-orientable if it admits an R-orientation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=164" target="_blank">J. Peter May 164</a>)</p>
Theorem (Vanishing). Let M be an n-manifold. For any coefficient group π, Hi (M ; π) = 0 if i > n, and ̃ H̃n (M ; π) = 0 if M is connected and is not compact.

We can use this together with Mayer-Vietoris sequences to construct R-fundamental classes at compact subspaces from R-orientations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Let K be a compact subset of M . Then, for any coefficient group π, Hi (M, M − K; π) = 0 if i > n, and an R-orientation of M determines an Rfundamental class of M at K. In particular, if M is compact, then an R-orientation of M determines an R-fundamental class of M (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. Let M be a connected compact n-manifold, n > 0. Then either M is not orientable and Hn (M ; Z) = 0 or M is orientable and the map Hn (M ; Z) −→ Hn (M, M − x; Z) ∼ = ∼ =Z is an isomorphism for every x ∈ M .

As an aside, the corollary leads to a striking example of the failure of the naturality of the splitting in the universal coefficient theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Thus the left and right vertical arrows are zero. If the splittings of the rows were natural, this would imply that the middle vertical arrow is also zero (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We begin with the general observation that homology is “compactly supported” in the sense of the following result. Lemma. For any space X and element x ∈ Hq (X), there is a compact subspace K of X and an element k ∈ Hq (K) that maps to x. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

the much more subtle statement that Hn (M ) = 0 if M is connected and is not compact. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=166" target="_blank">J. Peter May 166</a>)</p>
Remember that homology is a covariant functor with compact supports. Cohomology is a contravariant functor, and it does not have compact supports (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We would like to prove the Poincaré duality theorem by inductive comparisons of Mayer-Vietoris sequences, and the opposite variance of homology and cohomology makes it unclear how to proceed. To get around this, we introduce a variant of cohomology that does have compact supports and has enough covariant functoriality to allow us to proceed by comparisons of Mayer-Vietoris sequences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Consider the set K of compact subspaces K of M . This set is directed under inclusion; to conform with our earlier discussion of colimits, we may view K as a category whose objects are the compact subspaces K and whose maps are the inclusions between them. We define H q cq (M ) = colim H q (M, M − K), where the colimit is taken with respect to the homomorphisms H q (M, M − K) −→ H q (M, M − L) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Intuitively, thinking in terms of singular cohomology, its elements are represented by cocycles that vanish off some compact subspace (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A map f : M −→ N is said to be proper if f −1 (L) is compact in M when L is compact in N .

Theorem (Poincaré duality). Let M be an R-oriented n-manifold. Then D : Hcp cp (M ) −→ Hn−p (M ) is an isomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

6. The orientation cover There is an orientation cover of a manifold that helps illuminate the notion of orientability (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. Let M be a connected n-manifold. Then there is a 2-fold cover p : ̃ M̃ −→ M such that ̃ M̃ is connected if and only if M is not orientable (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. If M is simply connected, or if π1 (M ) contains no subgroup of index 2, then M is orientable. If M is orientable, then M admits exactly two orientations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We can use homology with coefficients in a commutative ring R to construct an analogous R-orientation cover. It depends on the units of R. For example, if R = Z2 , then the R-orientation cover is the identity map of M since there is a unique unit in R. This reproves the obvious fact that any manifold is Z2 oriented. The evident ring homomorphism Z −→ R induces a natural homomorphism H∗ (X; Z) −→ H∗ (X; R), and we see immediately that an orientation of M induces an R-orientation of M for any R.

The Poincaré duality theorem imposes strong constraints on the Euler characteristic of a manifold. It also leads to new invariants, most notably the index.

Moreover, there is a relative version of Poincaré duality in the context of manifolds with boundary, and this leads to necessary algebraic conditions on the cohomology of a manifold that must be satisfied if it is to be a boundary.

We shall later outline the theory of cobordism, which leads to necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for a manifold to be a boundary. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The Euler characteristic χ(X) of a space with finitely generated homology is defined by istic χ(X) χ(X) = i (−1)i rank Hi (X; Z).

We may take F = Z2 , and so dispense with the requirement that M be oriented. If n is odd, the summands of χ(M ) cancel in pairs, and we obtain the following conclusion. Proposition. If M is a compact manifold of odd dimension, then χ(M ) = 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This pairing is nonsingular. Since α ∪ β = (−1)m β ∪ α, it is skew symmetric if m is odd and is symmetric if m is even. When m is odd, we obtain the following conclusion. Proposition.

Lemma. Let F be a field of characteristic 6= 2, V be a finite dimensional vector space over F , and φ : V × V −→ F be a nonsingular skew symmetric bilinear form.

Let Hn = {(x1 , . . ., xn )|xn ≥ 0} be the upper half-plane in Rn . Recall that an n-manifold with boundary is a Hausdorff space M having a countable basis of open sets such that every point of M has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of H n . A point x is an interior point if it has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of Hn − ∂Hn ∼ = Rn ; otherwise it is a boundary point. It is a fact called “invariance of domain” that if U and V are homeomorphic subspaces of Rn and U is open, then V is open. Therefore, a homeomorphism of an open subspace of Hn onto an open subspace of Hn carries boundary points to boundary points. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We denote the boundary of an n-manifold M by ∂M . Thus M is a manifold without boundary if ∂M is empty; M is said to be closed if, in addition, it is compact. The space ∂M is an (n − 1)-manifold without boundary. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It is a fundamental question in topology to determine which closed manifolds are boundaries (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

we can ask whether or not a smooth (= differentiable) closed manifold is the boundary of a smooth manifold (with the induced smooth structure) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Remember that χ(M ) = 0 if M is a closed manifold of odd dimension. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=176" target="_blank">J. Peter May 176</a>)</p>
Proposition. If M = ∂W , where W is a compact (2m + 1)-manifold, then χ(M ) = 2χ(W ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=176" target="_blank">J. Peter May 176</a>)</p>
Corollary. If M = ∂W for a compact manifold W , then χ(M ) is even. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=176" target="_blank">J. Peter May 176</a>)</p>
For example, since χ(RP 2m ) = 1 and χ(CP n ) = n+ 1, this criterion shows that 2m RP and CP 2m cannot be boundaries. Notice that we have proved that these are not boundaries of topological manifolds, let alone of smooth ones. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The index gives a more striking criterion: if a closed oriented 4k-manifold M is the boundary of a (topological) manifold, then I(M ) = 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In the case of smooth manifolds, it can be seen in terms of inward-pointing unit vectors of the normal line bundle of the embedding ∂M −→ M . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We let M be an n-manifold with boundary, n > 0, throughout this section, and we let R be a given commutative ring. We say that M is R-orientable (or orientable if R = Z) if its interior ̊ M̊ = M − ∂M is R-orientable; similarly, an R-orientation of M is an R-orientation of its interior (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Topological collaring). There is an open neighborhood V of ∂M in M such that the identification ∂M = ∂M × {0} extends to a homeomorphism V ∼ = ∼ = ∂M × [0, 1).

It follows that the inclusion M̊ M̊ −→ M is a homotopy equivalence and the inclusion ∂M −→ M is a cofibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. If M is compact and R-oriented and z∂M ∈ Hn−1 (∂M ) is the fundamental class determined by the induced R-orientation on ∂M , then there is a unique element z ∈ Hn (M, ∂M ) such that ∂z = z∂M ; z is called the R-fundamental class determined by the R-orientation of M .

Theorem (Relative Poincaré duality). Let M be a compact R-oriented nmanifold with R-fundamental class z ∈ Hn (M, ∂M ; R).

We first give an algebraic criterion for the vanishing of the signature of a form and then show that the cup product form on the middle dimensional cohomology of M satisfies the criterion. Lemma. Let W be a n-dimensional subspace of a 2n-dimensional real vector space V . Let φ : V × V −→ R be a nonsingular symmetric bilinear form such that φ : W × W −→ R is identically zero. Then the signature of φ is zero. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

We here give a homotopical way of constructing ordinary theories that makes no use of chains, whether cellular or singular. We also show how to construct cup and cap products homotopically. This representation of homology and cohomology in terms of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces is the starting point of the modern approach to homology and cohomology theory, and we shall indicate how theories that do not satisfy the dimension axiom can be represented (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

indicate how theories that do not satisfy the dimension axiom can be represented. We shall also describe Postnikov systems, which give a way to approximate general (simple) spaces by weakly equivalent spaces built up out of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces. This is conceptually dual to the way that CW complexes allow the approximation of spaces by weakly equivalent spaces built up out of spheres (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Recall that a reduced homology theory on based CW complexes is a sequence of functors E ̃ Ẽq from the homotopy category of based CW complexes to the category of Abelian groups.

By a result of Milnor, if X has the homotopy type of a CW complex, then so does ΩX. By the Whitehead theorem, we therefore have a homotopy equivalence σ̃ : K(π, n) −→ ΩK(π, n + 1).

The example at hand is the Eilenberg-Mac Lane prespectrum {K(π, n)}. Another example is the “suspension prespectrum” {Σn X} of a based space X; the required maps Σ(Σn X) −→ Σn+1 X are the evident identifications. When X = S 0 , this is called the sphere prespectrum.

Theorem. Let {Tn } be a prespectrum such that Tn is (n − 1)-connected and of the homotopy type of a CW complex for each n.

If Z has a multiplication φ : Z × Z −→ Z such that the basepoint ∗ of Z is a two-sided unit up to homotopy, so that Z is an “H-space,” then φ induces an “addition” [X, Z] × [X, Z] −→ [X, Z].

. We say that Z is “grouplike” if there is a map χ : Z −→ Z such that φ(id × χ)∆ : Z −→ Z is homotopic to the trivial map, and then χ∗ : [X, Z] −→ [X, Z] sends an element x ∈ [X, Z] to x−1 .

Actually, the existence of inverses can be deduced if Z is only “grouplike” in the weaker sense that π0 (X) is a group, but we shall not need the extra generality. Now consider the multiplication on a loop space ΩY given by composition of loops. Our proof that π1 (Y ) is a group and π2 (Y ) is an Abelian group amounts to a proof of the following result. Lemma. For any based space Y , ΩY is a grouplike homotopy associative Hspace and Ω 2 Y is a grouplike homotopy associative and commutative H-space. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We can also construct cap products homotopically. To do so, it is convenient to bring function spaces into play, using the obvious isomorphisms [X, Y ] ∼ = ∼ = π0 F (X, Y ) and evaluation maps ε : F (X, Y ) ∧ X −→ Y.

We have implicitly studied the represented functors k(X) = [X, Y ] by decomposing X into cells.

There is an Eckmann-Hilton dual way of studying [X, Y ] by decomposing Y into “cocells.” We briefly describe this decomposition of spaces into their “Postnikov systems” here (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This decomposition answers a natural question: how close are the homotopy groups of a CW This deco groups of a C Q type? Since n complex X to being a complete set of invariants for its homotopy K(πn (X), n) has the same homotopy groups as X but is generally not weakly homotopy equivalent to it, some added information is needed. If X is simple, it turns out that the homotopy groups together with an inductively defined sequence of cohomology classes give a complete set of invariants.

By our definition of a Postnikov system, we must define Xn+1 to be the homotopy fiber of k n+2 .

It turns out that the Steenrod operations generate all mod 2 cohomology operations. In fact, the identity map of K(Z2 , q) specifies a fundamental class ιq ∈ H q (K(Z2 , q); Z2 ), and the following theorem holds. Theorem. H ∗ (K(Z2 , q); Z2 ) is a polynomial algebra whose generators are certain iterates of Steenrod operations applied to the fundamental class ιq . Explicitly, writing Sq I = Sq i1 · · · Sq ij for a sequence of positive integers I = {i1 , . . ., ij }, the generators are the Sq I ιq for those sequences I such that ir ≥ 2ir+1 for 1 ≤ r < j and i1 < i2 + · · · + ij + q.

We say that two vector bundles over B are equivalent if they are isomorphic over B, so that there is an isomorphism (g, id) between them. We let En (B) denote the set of equivalence classes of n-plane bundles over B (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Thus we have a contravariant set-valued functor En (−) on spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=195" target="_blank">J. Peter May 195</a>)</p>
Vector bundles should be thought of as rather rigid geometric objects, and the equivalence relation between them preserves that rigidity. Nevertheless, equivalence classes of n-plane bundles can be classified homotopically. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=195" target="_blank">J. Peter May 195</a>)</p>
In turn, the starting point of the classification theorem is the observation that the functor En (−), like homology and cohomology, is homotopy invariant in the sense that it factors (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

through the homotopy category hU . In less fancy language, this amounts to the following result. Proposition. The pullbacks of an n-plane bundle p : E −→ B along homotopic maps f0 , f1 : A −→ B are equivalent. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It can be verified on general abstract nonsense grounds, using Brown’s representability theorem, that the functor En (−) is representable in the form [−, BO(n)] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=196" target="_blank">J. Peter May 196</a>)</p>
It is far more useful to have an explicit concrete construction of the relevant “classifying space” BO(n). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We construct a particular n-plane bundle γn : En −→ BO(n), called the “universal n-plane bundle.” By pulling back γn along (homotopy classes of) maps f : B −→ BO(n), we obtain a natural transformation of functors [−, BO(n)] −→ En (−). We show that this natural transformation is a natural isomorphism of functors by showing how to construct a map (g, f ), unique up to homotopy, from any given n-plane bundle E over any space B to the universal n-plane bundle En ; it is in this sense that En is “universal.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let Vn (R q ) be the Stiefel variety of orthonormal n-frames in R q . Its points are n-tuples of orthonormal vectors in Rq , and it is topologized as a subspace of (Rq )n or, equivalently, as a subspace of (S q−1 )n . It is a compact manifold. Let Gn (Rq ) be the Grassmann variety of n-planes in Rq . Its points are the n-dimensional subspaces of Rq . Sending an n-tuple of orthonormal vectors to the n-plane they span gives a surjective function Vn (Rq ) −→ Gn (Rq ), and we topologize Gn (Rq ) as a quotient space of Vn (Rq ). It too is a compact manifold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

We define the classifying space BO(n) to be Gn (R∞ ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=196" target="_blank">J. Peter May 196</a>)</p>
Let Enq nq be the subbundle of the trivial bundle Gn (Rq ) × Rq whose points are the pairs (x, v) such that v is a vector in the plane x; denote the projection of Enq nq by γnq nq , so that γnq nq (x, v) = x. When n = 1, γ is called the “canonical line bundle” over RP q−1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We may let q go to infinity. We let En = En∞ and let γn = γn∞ : En −→ BO(n) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=196" target="_blank">J. Peter May 196</a>)</p>
Theorem. The natural transformation Φ : [−, BO(n)] −→ En (−) obtained by sending the homotopy class of a map f : B −→ BO(n) to the equivalence class of the n-plane bundle f ∗ En is a natural isomorphism of functors.

it is called the Gauss map of the tangent bundle of M (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=197" target="_blank">J. Peter May 197</a>)</p>
Similarly, using the orthogonal complements of tangent planes, we obtain the Gauss map E(ν) −→ E q q−n of the q normal bundle ν of the embedding of M in R .

Definition. Let k ∗ be a cohomology theory, such as H ∗ (−; π) for an Abelian group π. A characteristic class c of degree q for n-plane bundles is a natural assignment of a cohomology class c(ξ) ∈ k q (B) to bundles ξ with base space B. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Thus, if (g, f ) is a map from a bundle ζ over A to a bundle ξ over B, so that ζ is equivalent to f ∗ ξ, then f ∗ c(ξ) = c(ζ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Since the functor En is represented by BO(n), the Yoneda lemma specializes to give the following result. Lemma. Evaluation on γn specifies a canonical bijection between characteristic classes of n-plane bundles and elements of k ∗ (BO(n)). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

classes of n-plane bundles and elements of k ∗ (BO(n)). The formal similarity to the definition of cohomology operations is obvious (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=198" target="_blank">J. Peter May 198</a>)</p>
Moreover, the behavior of characteristic classes with respect to operations on bundles can be determined by calculating the maps on cohomology induced by maps between classifying spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We are particularly interested in Whitney sums of bundles (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=198" target="_blank">J. Peter May 198</a>)</p>
The internal sum, or Whitney sum, of two bundles over the same base space B is obtained by pulling back their external sum along the diagonal map of B (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For example, let ε denote the trivial line bundle over any space. We have the operation that sends an n-plane bundle ξ over B to the (n + 1)-plane bundle ξ ⊕ ε over B. There is a classifying map in : BO(n) −→ BO(n + 1) that is characterized up to homotopy by i∗n n (γn+1 ) = γn ⊕ ε. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. For n-plane bundles ξ over base spaces B, n ≥ 0, there are characteristic classes wi (ξ) ∈ H i (B; Z2 ), i ≥ 0, called the Stiefel-Whitney classes. They satisfy and are uniquely characterized by the following axioms. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Every mod 2 characteristic class for n-plane bundles can be written uniquely as a polynomial in the Stiefel-Whitney classes {w1 , . . ., wn }. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The mod 2 cohomology H ∗ (BO(n); Z2 ) is the polynomial algebra Z2 [w1 , . . ., wn ]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=199" target="_blank">J. Peter May 199</a>)</p>
P to consider as formal sums xi , deg xi = i guarantee that the sum isPfinite. a vector bundle ξ to be wi (ξ); (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Suppose that M immerses in Rq with normal bundle ν. Then τ (M ) ⊕ ν ∼ = ∼ = εq and we have the “Whitney duality formula” w(M ) ∪ w(ν) = 1, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

which shows how to calculate tangential Stiefel-Whitney classes in terms of normal Stiefel-Whitney classes, and conversely. This formula can be used to prove non-immersion results when we know w(M ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=199" target="_blank">J. Peter May 199</a>)</p>
Since the normal bundle of the standard embedding S q −→ Rq+1 is trivial, w(S q ) = 1. A manifold is said to be parallelizable if its tangent bundle is trivial. For some manifolds M , we can show that M is not parallelizable by showing that one of its Stiefel-Whitney classes is non-zero, but this strategy fails for M = S q . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=200" target="_blank">J.

We describe some standard computations in the cohomology of projective spaces that give less trivial examples. Write ζq for the canonical line bundle over RP q in this section (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=200" target="_blank">J. Peter May 200</a>)</p>
For example, w(RP q ) = 1 if and only if q = 2k − 1 for some k (as the reader should check) and therefore RP q can be parallelizable only if q is of this form (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If R q+1 admits a bilinear product without zero divisors, then it is not hard to prove that τ (RP q ) ∼ = ∼ = Hom(ζq , ζ ⊥ q⊥ ) admits q linearly independent cross-sections and is therefore trivial. We conclude that Rq+1 can admit such a product only if q+1 = 2k for some k. The real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, and Cayley numbers show that there is such a product for q + 1 = 1, 2, 4, and 8. As we shall explain in the next chapter, these are in fact the only q for which Rq+1 admits such a product (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

While the calculation of w(RP q ) just given is quite special, there is a remarkable general recipe, called the “Wu formula,” for the computation of w(M ) in terms of Poincaré duality and the Steenrod operations in H ∗ (M ; Z2 ). In analogy with w(M ), general recipe, called the “Wu formula,” for the computation of w( Poincaré duality and the Steenrod operations in H ∗ (M ; Z2 ). In anal we define the total Steenrod square of an element x by Sq(x) = i Sq i (x). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=200" target="_blank">J. Peter May 200</a>)</p>
Theorem (Wu formula). Let M be a smooth closed n-manifold with funda(M ; Z2 ). Then the total Stiefel-Whitney class w(M ) is equal Theorem (Wu formula). Let M be a smooth closed n-manifold with funda mental class z ∈ HnP (M ; Z2 ). Then the total Stiefel-Whitney class w(M ) is equ to Sq(v), where v = vi ∈ H ∗∗ (M ; Z2 ) is the unique cohomology class such that hv ∪ x, zi = hSq(x), zi for all x ∈ H (M ; Z2 ). Thus, for k ≥ 0, vk ∪ x = Sq k (x) for all x ∈ H n−k (M ; Z2 ), ∗ and wk (M ) = vk i+j=k Sq i (vj ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=201" target="_blank">J. Peter May 201</a>)</p>
The basic reason that such a formula holds is that the StiefelWhitney classes can be defined in terms of the Steenrod operations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=201" target="_blank">J. Peter May 201</a>)</p>
Since the tangent bundle of M depends on its smooth structure, this is rather surprising (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=201" target="_blank">J. Peter May 201</a>)</p>
Characteristic classes determine important numerical invariants of manifolds, called their characteristic numbers. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. Let M be a smooth closed R-oriented n-manifold with fundamental class z ∈ Hn (M ; R). For a characteristic class c of degree n, define the tangential characteristic number c[M ] ∈ R by c[M ] = hc(τ (M )), zi. Similarly, define the normal characteristic number c[ν(M )] by c[ν(M )] = hc(ν(M )), zi, where ν(M ) is the normal bundle associated to an embedding of M in Rq for q sufficiently large. (These numbers are well defined because any two embeddings of M in Rq for large q are isotopic and have equivalent normal bundles.) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

arge q are isotopic and have equivalent normal bundles.) In particular, if ri are integers such that iri = n, then the monomial w r1 · · · wnrn nrn P is a characteristic class of degree n, and all mod 2 characteristic classes of degree n are linear combinations of these. Different manifolds can have the same Stiefel-Whitney numbers (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma. If M is the boundary of a smooth compact (n + 1)-manifold W , then all tangential Stiefel-Whitney numbers of M are zero. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=201" target="_blank">J. Peter May 201</a>)</p>
Lemma. All tangential Stiefel-Whitney numbers of a smooth closed manifold M are zero if and only if all normal Stiefel-Whitney numbers of M are zero. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Thom). If M is a smooth closed n-manifold all of whose normal Stiefel-Whitney numbers are zero, then M is the boundary of a smooth (n + 1)manifold. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)</p>
Thus we need only compute the Stiefel-Whitney numbers of M to determine whether or not it is a boundary. By Wu’s formula, the computation only requires knowledge of the mod 2 cohomology of M , with its Steenrod operations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)</p>
There are several ways to construct the Stiefel-Whitney classes. The most illuminating one depends on a simple, but fundamentally important, construction on vector bundles, namely their “Thom spaces.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)</p>
Definition. Let ξ : E −→ B be an n-plane bundle. Apply one-point compactification to each fiber of ξ to obtain a new bundle Sph(E) over B whose fibers are spheres S n with given basepoints, namely the points at ∞. These basepoints specify a cross-section B −→ Sph(E). Define the Thom space T ξ to be the quotient space T (ξ) = Sph(E)/B. That is, T (ξ) is obtained from E by applying fiberwise one-point compactification and then identifying all of the points at ∞ to a single basepoint (denoted ∞). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)</p>
Remark. If we give the bundle ξ a Euclidean metric and let D(E) and S(E) denote its unit disk bundle and unit sphere bundle, then there is an evident homeomorphism between T ξ and the quotient space D(E)/S(E) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)</p>
In turn, D(E)/S(E) is homotopy equivalent to the cofiber of the inclusion S(E) −→ D(E) and therefore to the cofiber of the projection S(E) −→ B. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)</p>
If the bundle ξ is trivial, so that E = B × Rn , then Sph(E) = B × S n . Quotienting out B amounts to the same thing as giving B a disjoint basepoint and then forming the smash product B+ ∧ S n . That is, in this case the Thom complex is Σn B+ . Therefore, for any cohomology theory k ∗ , k q (B) = k̃ k̃ q (B+ ) ∼ = ∼ = k̃ k̃ n+q (T ξ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

which is called the “Thom diagonal. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=203" target="_blank">J. Peter May 203</a>)</p>
This should look very similar to the problem of patching local fundamental classes to obtain a global one; that is, it looks like a question of orientation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. Let ξ : E −→ B be an n-plane bundle. An R-orientation, or Thom class, of ξ is an element µ ∈ ̃ H̃ n (T ξ; R) such that, for every point b ∈ B, i∗b b (µ) is a generator of the free R-module ̃ H̃ n (Sbn bn ).

We leave it as an instructive exercise to verify that an R-orientation of a closed n-manifold M determines and is determined by an R-orientation of its tangent bundle τ (M ).

Theorem (Thom isomorphism theorem). Let µ ∈ H ̃ H̃ n (T ξ; R) be a Thom class for an n-plane bundle ξ : E −→ B. Define Φ : H q (B; R) −→ H ̃ H̃ n+q (T ξ; R) by Φ(x) = x ∪ µ. Then Φ is an isomorphism.

However, much the best proof from the point of view of anyone seriously interested in algebraic topology is to apply the Serre spectral sequence of the bundle Sph(E).

The Serre spectral sequence is a device for computing the cohomology of the total space E of a fibration from the cohomologies of its base B and fiber F . It measures the cohomological deviation of H ∗ (E) from H ∗ (B)⊗H ∗ (F ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Just as in orientation theory for manifolds, the question of orientability depends on the structure of the units of the ring R, and this leads to the following conclusion. Proposition.

The resulting map ω ∗ : H ∗ (BO(n); Z2 ) −→ H ∗ ((RP ∞ ) n ; Z2 ) Σn is a ring homomorphism between polynomial algebras on generators of the same degrees. It turns out to be a monomorphism and therefore an isomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

One advantage of this approach is that, since we know the Steenrod operations on H ∗ (RP ∞ ; Z2 ) and can read them off on H ∗ ((RP ∞ ) n ; Z2 ) by the Cartan formula, it leads to a purely algebraic calculation of the Steenrod operations in H ∗ (BO(n); Z2 ).

The Thom space of a complex or oriented real vector bundle is the Thom space of its underlying real vector bundle. We obtain characteristic classes in cohomology with any coefficients by applying cohomology operations to Thom classes, but it is rarely the case that the resulting characteristic classes generate all characteristic classes: the cases H ∗ (BO(n); Z2 ) and H ∗ (BSO(n); Z2 ) are exceptional (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. For n ≥ 1, there are elements ci ∈ H 2i (BU (n); Z), i ≥ 0, called the Chern classes. They satisfy and are uniquely characterized by the following axioms. (1) c0 = 1 and ci = 0 if i > n.

The reader deserves to be warned about a basic inconsistency in the literature. Remark. With the discussion above, c1 (γ n+1 1n ) is the canonical generator of H (CP n ; Z), where γ1n+1 2 1n is the canonical line bundle of lines in Cn+1 and points on the line. This is the standard convention in algebraic topology. In algebraic geometry, it is more usual to define Chern classes so that the first Chern class of the dual of γ n+1 1n is the canonical generator of H 2 (CP n ; Z). With this convention, the nth Chern class would be (−1)n cn . It is often unclear in the literature which convention is being followed. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Turning to oriented real vector bundles, we define the Pontryagin and Euler classes as follows, taking cohomology with coefficients in any commutative ring R. Definition. Define the Pontryagin classes pi ∈ H 4i (BO(n); R) by pi = (−1) i c ∗ (c2i ), c ∗ : H 4i (BU (n); R) −→ H 4i (BO(n); R); also write pi for πn∗ (pi ) ∈ H 4i (BSO(n); R).

Definition. Define the Euler class e(ξ) ∈ H n (B; R) of an R-oriented n-plane bundle ξ over the base space B by e(ξ) = Φ−1 µ2 , where µ ∈ H n (T ξ; R) is the Thom class. Giving the universal oriented n-plane bundle over BSO(n) the R-orientation induced by its integral orientation, this defines the Euler class e ∈ H n (BSO(n); R).

The name “Euler class” is justified by the following classical result, which well illustrates the kind of information that characteristic numbers can encode. 1 Theorem. If M is a smooth closed oriented manifold, then the characteristic number e[M ] = he(τ (M )), zi ∈ Z is the Euler characteristic of M . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The presence of 2-torsion makes the description of the integral cohomology rings of BO(n) and BSO(n) quite complicated, and these rings are almost never used in applications. Rather, one uses the mod 2 cohomology rings and the following description of the cohomology rings that result by elimination of 2-torsion. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Consider bundles ξ : Y −→ B with fiber G. For spaces U in a numerable open cover O of B, there are homeomorphisms φ : U ×G −→ p−1 (U ) such that p◦φ = π1 . We say that Y is a principal G-bundle if Y has a free right action by G, B is the orbit space Y /G, ξ is the quotient map, and the φ are maps of right G-spaces. We say that ξ : Y −→ B is a universal principal G-bundle if Y is a contractible space. In particular, for any topological group G whose identity element is a nondegenerate basepoint, such as any Lie group G, the map p : EG −→ BG constructed in Chapter 16 §5 is a universal principal G-bundle (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Observe that the long exact sequence of homotopy groups of a universal principal G-bundle gives isomorphisms πq (BG) ∼ = ∼ = πq−1 (G) for q ≥ 1. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

There is a classification theorem for principal G-bundles. Let PG(B) denote the set of equivalence classes of principal G-bundles over B, where two principal G-bundles over B are equivalent if there is a G-homeomorphism over B between them. Via pullback of bundles, this is a contravariant set-valued functor on the homotopy category of spaces. Theorem. Let γ : Y −→ Y /G be any universal principal G-bundle. The natural transformation Φ : [−, Y /G] −→ PG(−) obtained by sending the homotopy class of a map f : B −→ Y /G to the equivalence class of the principal G-bundle f ∗ Y is a natural isomorphism of functors.

Here an action is effective if gf = f for every f ∈ F implies g = e. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=209" target="_blank">J. Peter May 209</a>)</p>
For a principal Gbundle Y , let G act on Y × F by g(y, f ) = (yg −1 , gf ) and let Y ×G F be the orbit space (Y × F )/G. With the correct formal definition of a fiber bundle with group G and fiber F , every such fiber bundle p : E −→ B is equivalent to one of the form Y ×G F −→ Y /G ∼ = ∼ = B for some principal G-bundle Y over B (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In fact, the “associated principal G-bundle” Y can be constructed as the function space of all maps ψ : F −→ E such that ψ is an admissible homeomorphism onto some fiber Fb = p −1 (b).

We conclude that, for any F , PG(B) is naturally isomorphic to the set of equivalence classes of bundles with group G and fiber F over B. Fiber bundles with group O(n) and fiber Rn are real n-plane bundles, fiber bundles with group U (n) and fiber C n are complex n-plane bundles, and fiber bundles with group SO(n) and fiber Rn are oriented real n-plane bundles. Thus the classification theorems of the previous sections could all be rederived as special cases of the general classification theorem for principal G-bundles stated in this section (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The fact that it is a generalized cohomology theory is a consequence of the Bott periodicity theorem, which is one of the most important and influential theorems in all of topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

From the point of view of algebraic topology, real K-theory is a substantially more powerful invariant, but complex K-theory is usually more relevant to applications in other fields.

We consider the set V ect(X) of equivalence classes of vector bundles over a space X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=211" target="_blank">J. Peter May 211</a>)</p>
. The set V ect(X) forms an Abelian monoid (= semi-group) under Whitney sum, and it forms a semi-ring with multiplication given by the (internal) tensor product of vector bundles over X.

There is a standard construction, called the Grothendieck construction, of an Abelian group G(M ) associated to an Abelian monoid M : one takes the quotient of the free Abelian group generated by the elements of M by the subgroup generated by the set of elements of the form m + n − m ⊕ n, where ⊕ is the sum in M . The evident morphism of Abelian monoids i : M −→ G(M ) is universal: for any homomorphism of monoids f : M −→ G, where G is an Abelian group, there is a unique homomorphism of groups f ˜ f˜ : G(M ) −→ G such that f ˜ f˜ ◦ i = f (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If M is a semi-ring, then its multiplication induces a multiplication on G(M ) such that G(M ) is a ring, called the Grothendieck ring of M . If the semi-ring M is commutative, then the ring G(M ) is commutative (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. The K-theory of X, denoted K(X), is the Grothendieck ring of the semi-ring V ect(X). An element of K(X) is called a virtual bundle over X. We write [ξ] for the element of K(X) determined by a vector bundle ξ. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

we have the function d : V ect(X) −→ Z that sends a vector bundle to the dimension of its restriction to the component of the basepoint ∗. Since d is a homomorphism of semi-rings, it induces a dimension function d : K(X) −→ Z, which is a homomorphism of rings. Since d is an isomorphism when X is a point, d can be identified with the induced map K(X) −→ K(∗). Definition. The reduced K-theory ̃ K̃(X) of a based space X is the kernel of d : K(X) −→ Z. It is an ideal of K(X) and thus a ring without identity. Clearly K(X) ∼ = ∼ = K ̃ K̃(X) × Z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. The space BU × Z is a ring space up to homotopy.

Conversely, an isomorphism f from the trivial bundle over S 1 to itself gives a way to glue together the trivial bundles over D and D′ to reconstruct a bundle over S 2 .

The following useful observation applies to any representable functor, not just K-theory. Lemma. For nondegenerately based spaces X and Y , the projections of X × Y on X and on Y and the quotient map X×Y −→ X∧Y induce a natural isomorphism ̃ K̃(X ∧ Y ) ⊕ K ̃ K̃(X) ⊕ K ̃ K̃(Y ) ∼ = ∼ = K ̃ K̃(X × Y ), and ̃ K̃(X ∧ Y ) is the kernel of the map ̃ K̃(X × Y ) −→ ̃ K̃(X) ⊕ K ̃ K̃(Y ) induced by the inclusions of X and Y in X × Y .

Theorem (Bott periodicity). For nondegenerately based compact spaces X, β : ̃ K̃(X) ⊗ K ̃ K̃(S 2 ) −→ K ̃ K̃(X ∧ S 2 ) = K ̃ K̃(Σ 2 X) is an isomorphism.

Since ̃ K̃(S 2 ) ∼ = Z with generator b, the theorem implies that multiplication by the “Bott element” b specifies an isomorphism [X, BU × Z] = ∼ = K ∼ ̃ K̃(X) −→ K ̃ K̃(Σ 2 X) ∼ = ∼ = [X, Ω 2 (BU × Z)] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Bott’s map β can also be proved to be a homotopy equivalence using only basic algebraic topology. Since BU and ΩSU are simply connected spaces of the homotopy types of CW complexes, a relative version of the Hurewicz theorem called the Whitehead theorem shows that β will be a weak equivalence and therefore a homotopy equivalence if it induces an isomorphism on integral homology.

In any case, it should now be clear that we have a periodic Ω-prespectrum and therefore a generalized cohomology theory represented by it. Definition. The K-theory Ω-prespectrum KU has spaces KU2i = BU ×Z and KU2i+1 = U for all i ≥ 0. The structure maps are given by the canonical homotopy equivalence U ≃ ΩBU = Ω(BU × Z) and the Bott equivalence BU × Z ≃ ΩU . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We have a resulting reduced cohomology theory on based spaces such that ̃ K̃ 2i (X) = K̃(X) and K̃ 2i+1 (X) = K̃(ΣX) for all integers i. This theory has products that are induced by tensor products of bundles over compact spaces and that are induced by suitable maps φ : KUi ∧ KUj −→ KUi+j in general, just as for the cup product in ordinary cohomology. It is standard to view this simply as a Z2 -graded theory with groups ̃ K̃ 0 (X) and K̃ 1 (X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. Let E0 be the zero section of E. Define the projective bundle π : P (E) −→ X by letting the non-zero complex numbers act on E − E0 by scalar multiplication on fibers and taking the orbit space under this action. Equivalently, the fiber π −1 (x) ⊂ P (E) is the complex projective space of lines through the origin in the fiber ξ −1 (x) ⊂ E. Define the canonical line bundle L(E) over P (E) to be the subbundle of the pullback π ∗ E of ξ along π whose points are the pairs consisting of a line in a fiber of E and a point on that line. Let Q(E) be the quotient bundle π ∗ E/L(E) and let H(E) denote the dual of L(E). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Regard K(P (E)) as a K(X)algebra via π ∗ : K(X) −→ K(P (E)). Theorem (Bott periodicity). Let L be a line bundle over X and let H = H(L ⊕ ε). Then the K(X)-algebra K(P (L ⊕ ε)) is generated by the single element [H] subject to the single relation ([H] − 1)([L][H] − 1) = 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It will be based on a generalization to projective bundles of the calculation of H ∗ (CP n ). The proofs of both results are intertwined with the proof of the following “splitting principle,” which allows the deduction of explicit formulas about general bundles from formulas about sums of line bundles.

Theorem (Splitting principle). There is a compact space F (E) and a map p : F (E) −→ X such that p∗ E is a sum of line bundles over F (E) and both p∗ : H ∗ (X; Z) −→ H ∗ (F (E); Z) and p∗ : K(X) −→ K(F (E)) are monomorphisms.

Lemma (Splitting lemma). Both π ∗ : H ∗ (X; Z) −→ H ∗ (P (E); Z) and π ∗ : K(X) −→ K(P (E)) are monomorphisms. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Let x = c1 (L(E)) ∈ H 2 (P (E); Z). Then H ∗ (P (E); Z) is the free Theorem. Let x = c1 (L(E)) ∈ H 2 (P (E); Z). Then H ∗ (P (E); Z) is the free H (X; Z)-module on the basis 1, x, . . ., xn−1 , and the Chern classes of ξ are char∗  acterized by c0 (ξ) = 1 and the formula e fo n k=0 (−1) k ck (E)x n−k = 0.

One first a line bundle E, L(E) = E and c1 (E) = c′1 (E) by the definition of x. One first verifies by direct calculation that if E = L1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ln is a sum of line bundles, then ′ 1≤k≤n (x − c1 (Lk )) = 0. This implies that ck (E) is the kth elementary symmetric 1≤k≤n ′ (x − c1 (Lk )) = 0. This implies that ck k (E) is the kth elementary symmetric Q polynomial in the c1 (Lk ). By the Whitney sum formula for the Chern classes, this implies that c′k k (E) = ck (E) in this case (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The following analogue in K-theory of the previous theorem holds. Observe that, since they are continuous operations on complex vector spaces, the exterior powers λk can be applied fiberwise to give natural operations on vector bundles. Theorem. Let H = H(E). Then K(P (E)) is the free K(X)-module on the Theorem. Let H = H(E). Then K(P (E)) is the fre basis 1, [H], . . ., [H]n−1 , and the following formula holds: d t n k=0 (−1) k [H] k [λ k E] = 0.

We have seen above that ordinary cohomology and K-theory enjoy similar properties. The splitting theorem implies a direct connection between (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The example we are interested in is the “Chern character,” which gives rise to (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=219" target="_blank">J. Peter May 219</a>)</p>

For line bundles L and L′ , we have c1 (L ⊗ L′ ) = c1 (L) + c1 (L′ ). One way to see this is to recall that BU (1) ≃ K(Z, 2) and that line bundles are classified by their Chern classes regarded as elements of [X+ , BU (1)] ∼ = ∼ = H 2 (X; Z).

Lemma. The Chern character specifies a ring homomorphism ch : K(X) −→ H ∗∗ (X; Q). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=220" target="_blank">J. Peter May 220</a>)</p>
Lemma. For n ≥ 1, the Chern character maps ̃ K̃(S 2n ) isomorphically onto the image of H 2n (S 2n ; Z) in H 2n (S 2n ; Q). Therefore cn : K̃(S 2n ) −→ H 2n (S 2n ; Z) is a monomorphism with cokernel Z(n−1)! . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Together with some of the facts given in Chapter 23 §7, this has a remarkable application to the study of almost complex structures on spheres. Recall that a smooth manifold of even dimension admits an almost complex structure if its tangent bundle is the underlying real vector bundle of a complex bundle.

Theorem. S 2 and S 6 are the only spheres that admit an almost complex structure. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=220" target="_blank">J. Peter May 220</a>)</p>
It is classical that S 2 and S 6 admit almost complex structures and that S 4 does not. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We then have the following basic result, which actually holds for general compact spaces X provided that we replace singular cohomology by Č Čech cohomology. Theorem. For any finite based CW complex X, ch induces an isomorphism ̃ K̃ ∗ (X) ⊗ Q −→ H ̃ H̃ ∗∗ (X; Q). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

There are natural operations in K-theory, called the Adams operations, that are somewhat analogous to the Steenrod operations in mod 2 cohomology. In fact, the analogy can be given content by establishing a precise relationship between the Adams and Steenrod operations, but (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. For each non-zero integer k, there is a natural homomorphism of rings ψ k : K(X) −→ K(X). These operations satisfy the following properties. (1) ψ 1 = id and ψ −1 is induced by complex conjugation of bundles. (2) ψ k ψ ℓ = ψ kℓ = ψ ℓ ψ k . (3) ψ p (x) ≡ xp mod p for any prime p. (4) ψ k (ξ) = ξ k if ξ is a line bundle. (5) ψ k (x) = k n x if x ∈ K ̃ K̃(S 2n ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

Recall that the subring of symmetric polynomials in the polynomial algebra Z[x1 , . . ., xn ] is the polynomial algebra Z[σ1 , . . ., σn ], where σi = x1 x2 · · · xi + · · · is the ith elementary symmetric function.

Remark. The observant reader will have noticed that, by analogy with the definition of the Stiefel-Whitney classes, we can define characteristic classes in Ktheory by use of the Adams operations and the Thom isomorphism, setting ρk (E) = Φ−1 ψ k Φ(1) for n-plane bundles E (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We give one of the most beautiful and impressive illustrations of the philosophy described in the first chapter. We define a numerical invariant, called the “Hopf invariant,” of maps f : S 2n−1 −→ S n and show that it can only rarely take the value one. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=223" target="_blank">J. Peter May 223</a>)</p>
We then indicate several problems whose solution can be reduced to the question of when such maps f take the value one. Adams’ original solution to the Hopf invariant one problem used secondary cohomology operations in ordinary cohomology and was a critical starting point of modern algebraic topology. The later realization that a problem that required secondary operations in ordinary cohomology could be solved much more simply using primary operations in Ktheory had a profound impact on the further development of the subject.

H ̃ H̃ ∗ (X) is free Abelian on generators x = [i] and y = [j]. Define an integer h(f ), the Hopf invariant of f , by x 2 = h(f )y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The determination of which spheres are H-spaces has the following implications. Theorem. Let ω : Rn × Rn −→ Rn be a map with a two-sided identity element e 6= 0 and no zero divisors.

Note that ω need not be bilinear, just continuous. Also, it need not have a strict unit; all that is required is that e be a two-sided unit up to homotopy for the restriction of ω to Rn − {0}. Theorem. If S n is parallelizable, then n = 0, 1, 3, or 7. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Cobordism theories were introduced shortly after K-theory, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=227" target="_blank">J. Peter May 227</a>)</p>
We shall describe the cobordism of smooth closed manifolds, but this is in fact a particularly elementary example. Other examples include smooth closed manifolds with extra structure on their stable normal bundles: orientation, complex structure, Spin structure, or symplectic structure for example. All of these except the symplectic case have been computed completely. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=227" target="_blank">J. Peter May 227</a>)</p>
The area is pervaded by insights from algebraic topology that are quite mysterious geometrically. For example, the complex cobordism groups turn out to be concentrated in even degrees: every smooth closed manifold of odd dimension with a complex structure on its stable normal bundle is the boundary of a compact manifold (with compatible bundle information). However, there is no geometric understanding of why this should be the case. The analogue with “complex” replaced by “symplectic” is false. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We consider the problem of classifying smooth closed n-manifolds M . One’s first thought is to try to classify them up to diffeomorphism, but that problem is in principle unsolvable. Thom’s discovery that one can classify such manifolds up to the weaker equivalence relation of “cobordism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We say that two smooth closed nmanifolds M and N are cobordant if there is a smooth compact manifold W whose boundary is the disjoint union of M and N , ∂W = M ∐ N . We write Nn for the set of cobordism classes of smooth closed n-manifolds. It is convenient to allow the empty set ∅ as an n-manifold for every n. Disjoint union gives an addition on the set Nn .

Nn is a vector space over Z2 . Cartesian product of manifolds defines a multiplication Nm × Nn −→ Nm+n .

The strategy for the proof of Thom’s theorem is to describe Nn as a homotopy group of a certain Thom space.

Given a smooth closed n-manifold M , we may embed it in Rn+q for q sufficiently large, and we let ν be the normal bundle of the embedding.

Embed M as the zero section of the total space E(ν).

Just as we defined the homotopy groups of a prespectrum T by the formula πn (T ) = colim πn+q (Tq ), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

we define the homology and cohomology groups of T with respect to a homology theory k∗ and cohomology theory k ∗ on spaces by the formulas kn (T ) = colim k̃ k̃n+q (Tq ), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In fact, this definition of cohomology is inappropriate in general, differing from the appropriate definition by a lim 1 error term. However, the definition is correct when k ∗ is ordinary cohomology with coefficients in a field R and each H̃ n+q (Tq ; R) is a finite dimensional vector space over R.

Observe that there is no cup product in H ∗ (T ; R): the maps in the limit system factor through the reduced cohomologies of suspensions, in which cup products are identically zero (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The Hurewicz homomorphisms πn+q (Tq ) −→ ̃ H̃n+q (Tq ; Z) pass to colimits to give the stable Hurewicz homomorphism h : πn (T ) −→ Hn (T ; Z). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If T is an associative and commutative ring prespectrum, then h : π∗ (T ) −→ H∗ (T ; R) is a map of graded commutative rings. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Recall that we have Thom isomorphisms Φq : H n (BO(q)) −→ H ̃ H̃ n+q (T O(q)) obtained by cupping with the Thom class µq ∈ H ̃ H̃ q (T O(q)). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We therefore obtain a “stable Thom isomorphism” Φ : H n (BO) −→ H n (T O) on passage to limits.

Since the Steenrod operations are stable and natural, they pass to limits to define natural operations Sq i : H n (T ) −→ H n+i (T ) for i ≥ 0 and prespectra T .

Definition. The mod 2 Steenrod algebra A is the quotient of the free associative Z2 -algebra generated by elements Sq i , i ≥ 1, by the ideal generated by the Adem relations (which are stated in Chapter 22 §5) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma. For spaces X, H ∗ (X) has a natural A-module structure. Lemma. For prespectra T , H ∗ (T ) has a natural A-module structure (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The elements of A are stable mod 2 cohomology operations, and our description of the cohomology of K(Z2 , q)s in Chapter 22 §5 implies that A is in fact the algebra of all stable mod 2 cohomology operations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

What is still more important to us is that A not only has the composition product A ⊗ A −→ A, it also has a coproduct ψ : A −→ A ⊗ A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Algebraic structures like this, with compatible products and coproducts, are called “Hopf algebras.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Let N∗ be the algebra defined abstractly by N∗ = Z2 [ui |i > 1 and i 6= 2 r − 1], where deg ui = i.

Now consider the Hurewicz homomorphism h : π∗ (T ) −→ H∗ (T ) of a prespectrum T . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=236" target="_blank">J. Peter May 236</a>)</p>
Theorem. h : π∗ (T O) −→ H∗ (T O) is a monomorphism and g◦h maps π∗ (T O) isomorphically onto N∗ . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We shall prove that a smooth closed n-manifold M is a boundary if and only if all of its normal Stiefel-Whitney numbers are zero. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Polynomials in the StiefelWhitney classes are elements of H ∗ (BO) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=236" target="_blank">J. Peter May 236</a>)</p>
follows that cobordant manifolds have the same normal Stiefel-Whitney numbers. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=236" target="_blank">J. Peter May 236</a>)</p>
-Whitney numbers. The assignment of Stiefel-Whitney numbers to corbordism classes of n-manifolds specifies a homomorphism # : H n (BO) ⊗ Nn −→ Z2 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=236" target="_blank">J. Peter May 236</a>)</p>
To say that all normal Stiefel-Whitney numbers of M are zero is to say that w#[M ] = 0 for all w ∈ H n (BO) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=237" target="_blank">J. Peter May 237</a>)</p>
this implies that [M ] = 0 and thus that M is a boundary. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=237" target="_blank">J. Peter May 237</a>)</p>
We think of prespectra as “stable objects” that have associated homotopy, homology, and cohomology groups. Imagine that we have a good category of stable objects, analogous to the category of based spaces, that is equipped with all of the constructions that we have on based spaces: wedges (= coproducts), colimits, products, limits, suspensions, loops, homotopies, cofiber sequences, fiber sequences, smash products, function objects, and so forth. Let us call the stable objects in our imagined category “spectra” and call the category of such objects S . We have in mind an analogy with the notions of presheaf and sheaf.

The homology and cohomology groups of Σ∞ X are the (reduced) homology and cohomology groups of X; the homotopy groups of Σ ∞ X are the stable homotopy groups of X.

Continuing our thought exercise, we can form the homotopy category hS of spectra and can define homotopy groups in terms of homotopy classes of maps from sphere spectra to spectra (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Reflection on the periodic nature of K-theory suggests that we should define sphere spectra of negative dimension and define homotopy groups πq (X) for all integers q (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=239" target="_blank">J. Peter May 239</a>)</p>
That is, we develop a theory of CW spectra using sphere spectra as the domains of attaching maps (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=239" target="_blank">J. Peter May 239</a>)</p>
The Whitehead and cellular approximation theorems hold, and every spectrum X admits a CW approximation ΓX −→ X. We define the set [X, Y ] of morphisms X −→ Y in h̄ h̄S to be the set of homotopy classes of maps ΓX −→ ΓY . This is a stable category in the sense that the functor Σ : h̄ h̄S −→ h h̄ h̄S is an equivalence of categories. More explicitly, the natural maps X −→ ΩΣX and ΣΩX −→ X are isomorphisms in h h̄ h̄S . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=239" target="_blank">J.

In particular, up to isomorphism, every object in the category h̄ h̄S is a suspension, hence a double suspension (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This implies that each [X, Y ] is an Abelian group and composition is bilinear. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=239" target="_blank">J. Peter May 239</a>)</p>
so that cofiber sequences and fiber sequences are equivalent. Therefore cofiber sequences give rise to long exact sequences of homotopy groups. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The homotopy groups of wedges and products of spectra are given by topy π∗ ( i roups of Xi ) = i edges and product π∗ (Xi ) and π∗ ( i of spectr Xi ) = i π∗ (Xi ).

Therefore, if only Theref map i e, if only Q Xi −→ fi i nitely many πq (Xi ) a Xi is an isomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A spectrum E represents a homology theory E∗ and a cohomology theory E ∗ specified in terms of smash products and function spectra by Eq (X) = πq (X ∧ E) and E q (X) = π−q F (X, E) ∼ = ∼ = [X, Σ q E].

Moreover, every homology or cohomology theory on h h̄ h̄S is so represented by some spectrum E. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Its only non-zero homotopy group is π0 (Hπ) = π, and the Hurewicz homomorphism maps this group isomorphically onto H0 (Hπ; Z). When π = Z2 , the natural map H0 (HZ2 ; Z) −→ H0 (HZ2 ; Z2 ) is also an isomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Returning to our motivating example, we write M O for the “Thom spectrum” that arises from the Thom prespectrum T O.

However, these early constructions were far more primitive than our outline suggests. While they gave a satisfactory stable category, the underlying category of spectra did not have products, limits, and function objects, and its smash product was not associative, commutative, or unital. In fact, a fully satisfactory category of spectra was not constructed until 1995. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. A spectrum E is a prespectrum such that the adjoints σ̃ : En −→ ΩEn+1 of the structure maps σ : ΣEn −→ En+1 are homeomorphisms. A map f : T −→ T ′ of prespectra is a sequence of maps fn : Tn −→ Tn′ such that σ ′ n′ ◦ Σfn = fn+1 ◦ σn for all n. A map f : E −→ E ′ of spectra is a map between E and E ′ regarded as prespectra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=240" target="_blank">J. Peter May 240</a>)</p>
We define wedges and colimits of spectra by first performing the construction on the prespectrum level and then applying the functor L. If we start with spectra and construct products or limits spacewise, then the result is again a spectrum; that is, limits of spectra are the limits of their underlying prespectra. Thus the category S is complete and cocomplete. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=240" target="_blank">J. Peter May 240</a>)</p>
We now have cylinders E ∧ I+ and thus can define homotopies between maps of spectra. Similarly we have cones CE = E ∧ I (where I has basepoint 1), suspensions ΣE = E ∧ S 1 , path spectra F (I, E) (where I has (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Similarly, we define the smash product T ∧X and function prespectrum F (X, T ) of a based space X and a prespectrum T spacewise. For a spectrum E, we define E ∧ X by applying L to the prespectrum level construction; the prespectrum F (X, E) is already a spectrum. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

basepoint 0), and loop spectra ΩE = F (S 1 , E). The development of cofiber and fiber sequences proceeds exactly as for based spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=241" target="_blank">J. Peter May 241</a>)</p>
The essential point is that homotopy and homology commute with colimits. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=241" target="_blank">J. Peter May 241</a>)</p>
It is not true that cohomology converts colimits to limits in general, because of lim 1 error terms, and this is one reason that our definition of the cohomology of prespectra via limits is inappropriate except under restrictions that guarantee the vanishing of lim 1 terms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=241" target="_blank">J. Peter May 241</a>)</p>
We define QX = ∪Ωq Σq X, and we find that the nth space of Σ∞ X is QΣn X. It should be apparent that the homotopy groups of the space QX are the stable homotopy groups of X.

For example, the homotopy groups of the K-theory spectrum are Z for every even integer and zero for every odd integer (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Thus, if we have a prespectrum T whose invariants we are interested in, such as an Eilenberg-Mac Lane Ω-prespectrum or the K-theory Ω-prespectrum, then we can construct a spectrum LKT that has the same invariants (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

. Localization and completion; rational homotopy theory Since the early 1970s, it has been standard practice in algebraic topology to localize and complete topological spaces, and not just their algebraic invariants, at sets of primes and then to study the subject one prime at a time, or rationally. Two of the basic original references are: D. Sullivan. The genetics of homotopy theory and the Adams conjecture. Annals of Math. 100(1974), 1–79. A.K. Bousfield and D.M. Kan. Homotopy limits, completions, and localizations. Lecture Notes in Mathematics Vol. 304. Springer-Verlag. 1972. A more accessible introduction to localization and a readable recent paper on completion are: P. Hilton, G. Mislin, and J. Roitberg. Localization of nilpotent groups and spaces. North-Holland. 1975. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=249" target="_blank">J. Peter May 249</a>)</p>
When spaces are rationalized, there is a completely algebraic description of the result. The main original reference and a more accessible source are: D. Sullivan. Infinitesimal computations in topology. Publ. Math. IHES 47(1978), 269–332. A.K. Bousfield and V.K.A.M. Gugenheim. On PL de Rham theory and rational homotopy type. Memoirs Amer. Math. Soc.

Peter May.pdf#page=249" target="_blank">J. Peter May 249</a>)</p>
Another area well established by the mid-1970s. The following book is a delightful read, with capsule introductions of many topics other than infinite loop space theory, a very pleasant starting place for learning modern algebraic topology: J.F. Adams. Infinite loop spaces. Annals of Math. Studies No. 90. Princeton University Press. 1978 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=249" target="_blank">J. Peter May 249</a>)</p>
The following survey article is less easy going, but gives an indication of the applications to high dimensional geometric topology and to algebraic K-theory: J.P. May. Infinite loop space theory. Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 83(1977), 456–494. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=249" target="_blank">J. Peter May 249</a>)</p>
Adams’ book cited in §16 gives a spectral sequence for the computation of stable homotopy groups in terms of generalized cohomology theories. Starting from complex cobordism and related theories, its use has been central to two waves of major developments in stable homotopy theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=250" target="_blank">J. Peter May 250</a>)</p>
A good exposition for the first wave: D.C. Ravenel. Complex cobordism and stable homotopy groups of spheres. Academic Press. 1986. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=250" target="_blank">J. Peter May 250</a>)</p>
The essential original paper and a very nice survey article on the second wave: E. Devinatz, M.J. Hopkins, and J.H. Smith. Nilpotence and stable homotopy theory. Annals of Math. 128(1988), 207–242. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=250" target="_blank">J. Peter May 250</a>)</p>
The cited Proceedings contain good introductory survey articles on several other topics in algebraic topology. A larger scale exposition of the second wave is: D.C. Ravenel. Nilpotence and periodicity in stable homotopy theory. Annals of Math. Studies No. 128. Princeton University Press. 1992. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=250" target="_blank">J. Peter May 250</a>)</p>
There is a leap from the level of this introductory book to that of the most recent work in the subject. One recent book that helps fill the gap is: P. Selick. Introduction to homotopy theory. Fields Institute Monographs No. 9. American Mathematical Society. 1997 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=250" target="_blank">J. Peter May 250</a>)</p>
There is a recent expository book for the reader who would like to jump right in and see the current state of algebraic topology; although it focuses on equivariant theory, it contains introductions and discussions of many non-equivariant topics: J.P. May et al. Equivariant homotopy and cohomology theory. NSF-CBMS Regional Conference Monograph. 1996. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=250" target="_blank">J. Peter May 250</a>)</p>
For the reader of the last section of this book whose appetite has been whetted for more stable homotopy theory, there is an expository article that motivates and explains the properties that a satisfactory category of spectra should have: J.P. May. Stable algebraic topology and stable topological algebra. Bulletin London Math. Soc. 30(1998), 225–234 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A real vector bundle £ over B consists of the following: 1) a topological space E = E(£) called the total space, 2) a (continuous) map 7: E » B called the projection map, and 3) for each b ¢ B the structure of a vector space” over the real numbers in the set 7~1(b).

These must satisfy the following restriction: Condition of local triviality. For each point b of B there should exist a neighborhood U C B, an integer n> 0, and a homeomorphism h:Ux RP > 71) so that, for each b ¢ U, the correspondence x + h(b, x) defines an isomorphism between the vector space R™ and the vector space 7 1(b).

Such a pair (U,h) will be called a local coordinate system for & about b. If it is possible to choose U equal to the entire base space, then & will be called a trivial bundle.

DEFINITION. A Euclidean vector bundle is a real vector bundle ¢& together with a continuous function §: E() > R such that the restriction of pu to each fiber of ¢ is positive definite and quadratic.

More generally a smooth map f:M -» N between smooth manifolds is called an immersion if the Jacobian Df, : DM, -> DN¢(x) maps the tangent space DM, injectively (i.e., with kernel zero) for each x ¢ M.

For the first Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence we take a very algebraic approach closely related to Eilenberg and Moore’s original proof. This allows the demonstration of homological techniques useful in other contexts and also demonstrates clearly how much information is lost when one passes from the singular chain complex on a space to its homology.

In contrast the local structure of a symplectic manifold is, by Darboux’s theorem, always equivalent to the standard structure on Euclidean space. Hence there cannot be any local invariants in symplectic geometry. This should be contrasted with Riemannian geometry where the curvature provides such local invariants. These local invariants severely restrict the group of isometries and give rise to an infinite dimensional variety of nonequivalent Riemannian metrics. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=9" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 9</a>)</p>
Here are some vaguely worded but typical questions: (1) Which manifolds support a symplectic structure? What symplectic invariants are there to distinguish one from another? (ii) Are there any special distinguishing features of Hamiltonian flows on arbitrary compact energy surfaces in Euclidean space? For example, must they always have a periodic orbit? (iii) Must a symplectomorphism always have ‘a lot’ of fixed points? (iv) What can be said about the shape of a symplectic image of a ball? Can it be long and thin, or must it always be in some sense round? (v) Is there a geometric way to understand the fact that a symplectic structure makes 2-dimensional measurements? (A symplectic structure is a special kind of 2-form, but what geometric meaning does that have?)

It establishes Darboux’s theorem and Moser’s stability theorem, and also contains an introduction to contact geometry, the odd-dimensional analogue of symplectic geometry.

Consider the problem of minimizing the action integral (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 20</a>)</p>
Consider a system whose configurations are described by points x in Fuclidean space R® which move along trajectories z(t). As we shall see in Lemma 1.1 below, the assumption that these paths minimize some action functional gives rise to a system of n second-order differential equations called the Euler-Lagrange equations of the variational problem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 20</a>)</p>
We will then show how these equations can be transformed into a Hamiltonian system of 2n first-order equations. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 20</a>)</p>
The function L is called the Lagrangian of this variational problem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=21" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 21</a>)</p>
A minimal path x : [to,t1] = R™ is a solution of the Euler— Lagrange equations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=21" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 21</a>)</p>
As alwaysin a variational problem, the Euler-Lagrange equations correspond to critical points of the functional under consideration rather than to actual minima or maxima. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=21" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 21</a>)</p>

It has long been suspected that the group of symplectomorphisms is significantly smaller than that of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=39" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 39</a>)</p>
However, there was po result which pinpointed a difference until Gromov proved his celebrated nonsqueezing theorem in 1985. This says that a standard symplectic ball cannot be symplectically embedded into a thin cylinder. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=39" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 39</a>)</p>
The minimum number of critical points of a function on a compact manifold M is a topological invariant of that manifold. The minimum is taken over all smooth functions f : M — R and we denote it by Crit(M). It is obvious that Crit(M) > 2 since every nonconstant function must have a distinct maximum and minimum. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=43" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 43</a>)</p>
The latter implies that the number of fixed (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=43" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 43</a>)</p>
points of a map ¢ : M — M which is homotopic to the identity is greater than or equal to the number of zeros of a vector field on M (when these are counted with appropriate multiplicities) which is the alternating sum of the Betti numbers. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 44</a>)</p>
The fact that the Arnold conjecture gives sharper estimates for the number of fixed points than the Lefschetz fixed point theorem is a global version of the observation that a function on a manifold must have more critical points than a vector field (or 1-form) must have zeros. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 44</a>)</p>
The latter statement has a direct interpretation in symplectic geometry since the differential of a function is an exact Lagrangian submanifold of the cotangent bundle and the critical points are the intersections with the zero section.

What if the columns of A are not orthonormal? In the next section we will learn a method for finding an orthonormal basis for R(A). From this method we will obtain a factorization of A into a product QR, where Q has an orthonormal set of column vectors and R is upper triangular. With this factorization, the least squares problem is easily solved. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Steven J.

The pioneering work of Pontryagin and Thom forged a deep connection between certain geometric problems (such as the classiﬁcation of manifolds) and homotopy theory, through the medium of the Thom space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Budyak 6</a>)</p>
Computations become possible upon stabilization, and this provided some of the ﬁrst and most compelling examples of “spectra.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Budyak 6</a>)</p>
This international tradition was continued with the more or less simultaneous work by Novikov and Milnor on complex cobordism, and later by Quillen. More recently Dennis Sullivan opened the way to the study of “manifolds with singularities,” a study taken up most forcefully by the Russian school, notably by Vershinin, Botvinnik, and Rudyak.

The contents of this book are concentrated around Thom spaces (spectra), orientability theory and (co)bordism theory (including (co)bordism with singularities), framed by (co)homology theories and spectra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">Budyak 10</a>)</p>
we consider the (inter)connections between geometry and homotopy theory, since Thom spectra and related matters are now the main tools for this interplay (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Budyak 11</a>)</p>
of the ﬁrst results in this area was the Gauss–Bonnet formula, relating a geometrical invariant (the curvature) to a homotopical one (the Euler characteristic). Proceeding, we can recall the Riemann–Roch Theorem, the Poincaré integrality theory, relationships between critical points of a smooth function on a smooth manifold and its homotopy type (Lusternik– Schnirelmann, Morse), the de Rham Theorem, etc. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Budyak 11</a>)</p>
The term “cohomology theory” is used for what was previously called “generalized” or “extraordinary” cohomology theory, i.e., for functors which satisfy all the Eilenberg– Steenrod axioms except the dimension axioms. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Budyak 11</a>)</p>
Every homology theory h∗ (−) yields a so-called dual cohomology theory h ∗ (−), and vice versa. They are connected via the equality  h  h i (X) =  h  hn−i (Y ) where Y is n-dual to X (and tilde denotes the reduced (co)homology). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Budyak 11</a>)</p>
Thom spaces. The Thom space T ξ of a locally trivial Rn -bundle ξ = {p : E → B} is deﬁned as follows. Let ξ • be the S n -bundle obtained from ξ by the ﬁberwise one-point compactiﬁcation, and let E • be the total space of ξ . Then the “inﬁnities” of the ﬁbers form a section s : B → E • , and we deﬁne T ξ := E • /s(B). Furthermore, the Thom space of a spherical ﬁbration {p : E → B} is the cone C(p) of the projection (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)</p>
p. For example, the Thom space of the Rn -bundle over a point is S n , the Thom space of the open Möbius band (considered as the R1 -bundle over S 1 ) is the real projective plane RP 2 , the Thom space of the Hopf bundle S 3 → S 2 (with ﬁber S 1 ) is the complex projective plane CP 2 . We use Thom’s notation M On for the Thom space T γ n of the universal n-dimensional vector bundle γ n over the classifying space BOn , i.e., M On := T γ n ; e.g., M O1 = RP ∞ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)</p>
.C. Whitehead observed the importance of the structure on the normal bundle in classifying structures on manifolds. It turns out that Thom spaces establish an adequate context for this. Namely, for every closed smooth manifold M n , the set of (diﬀeomorphism classes of) smooth manifolds homotopy equivalent to M is controlled by the group πn+N (T ν), where ν is the normal bundle of an embedding of M in Rn+N with N large enough (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)</p>
This is closely related to the Milnor–Spanier–Atiyah Duality Theorem, which asserts that T ν and M/∂M are stable N -dual for every compact manifold M . This theorem clariﬁes connections between manifolds and their normal bundles and enables us to transmit properties of bundles to properties of manifolds. For example, we have the Thom isomorphism ϕ : H i (X; Z/2) →  H  H i+n (T ξ; Z/2) for every locally trivial Rn -bundle ξ over a space X, and the above theorem transforms it to the Poincaré duality H i (M ; Z/2) ∼ = ∼ = Hn−i (M, ∂M ; Z/2) for every compact n-dimensional manifold M . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)</p>
Turning to another example, I recall the Thom formula wi (ξ) = ϕ −1 Sq i uξ where ξ is an n-dimensional vector bundle over a space X, wi (ξ) is its i-th Stiefel–Whitney class, ϕ : H i (X; Z/2) →  H  H i+n (T ξ; Z/2) is the Thom isomorphism and uξ ∈ H (T ξ; Z/2) is the Thom class of ξ. This formula expands n a geometric invariant (the Stiefel–Whitney class) via the Steenrod operation which is a purely homotopic thing. Moreover, we can use the formula in order to deﬁne the Stiefel–Whitney classes of spherical ﬁbrations. In particular, it becomes clear that the Stiefel–Whitney classes are invariants of the ﬁber homotopy type of a vector bundle (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)</p>
Generalizing, we can consider an arbitrary natural transformation τ : h ∗ → k ∗ of cohomology theories instead of Sq i . Then, under suitable conditions on ξ, there is a generalized Thom class u hξ ∈  h  h n (T ξ) and a generalized Thom isomorphism ϕk : k i (X) →  k  k i+n (T ξ), and so we can form the class K(ξ) = ϕ −1 k τ u h ξ which is an analogue and generalization of the Stiefel–Whitney class (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)</p>
So, we have a large source of invariants of Rn -bundles. For example, the Todd genus and the  A  genus are particular cases of this construction. Moreover, the wellA known integrality theorems which are related to Todd and  A  genera can be A generalized for the class K (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)</p>
Pontrjagin [1] proved that if a manifold bounds then all its characteristic numbers are trivial. In particular, RP 2 does not bound because w2 (RP 2 ) = 0. So, N2 = 0, i.e., some groups Nk are non-trivial (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)</p>
Well, but how to compute Nk ? Clearly, N0 = Z/2, N1 = 0. Using the classiﬁcation of closed surfaces, one can prove that N2 = Z/2: every orientable surface bounds, and every non-orientable surface either bounds or is bordant to RP 2 ; and RP 2 does not bound (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)</p>
Rokhlin [1] proved that N3 = 0, using complicated and tricky geometry. The further computation of Nk looked absolutely hopeless; however this was done by Thom [2] via an exciting and successful application of homotopy theory. Namely, Thom proved that N k = πk+N (M ON ) for N large enough (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)</p>
he answer is N∗ = Z/2 [xi ], dim xi = i, i ∈ N, i = 2s − 1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)</p>
where N∗ = ⊕Nk is the graded ring with the multiplication induced by the direct product of manifolds (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)</p>
The above constructions can be generalized: we can consider oriented manifolds or, more generally, manifolds equipped with some extra structures. As above, there arise certain bordism groups, and they can be interpreted as homotopy groups of certain Thom spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Budyak 14</a>)</p>
We use a category of spectra proposed by Adams [5]. So, a spectrum E is a sequence {En , sn }∞ n=−∞ of pointed CW -spaces En and pointed CW embeddings sn : SEn → En+1 where S denotes the pointed suspension. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Budyak 14</a>)</p>
(1) For every pointed space X we have the spectrum Σ ∞ X = {S n X, sn } where sn : SS n X → S n+1 X is the identity map. (2) For every pointed space X and every spectrum E = {En , sn } we have the spectrum X ∧ E = {X ∧ En , 1 ∧ sn }. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Budyak 14</a>)</p>
(3) Let θ 1 be the trivial 1-dimensional vector bundle over BOn , and let the map BOn → BOn+1 (assuming it to be an embedding) classify the vector bundle γ n ⊕ θ1 . Then we have a map sn : T (γ n ⊕ θ1 ) → T γ n+1 . Moreover, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Budyak 14</a>)</p>
Clearly, Nk = Nk (pt). Moreover, N k (X) = πk+N (X + ∧ M ON ) for N large enough, where X + is the disjoint union of the space X and a point. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Budyak 14</a>)</p>
one can prove that T (γ n ⊕ θ1 ) = ST γ n = SM On , and so we have the Thom spectrum M O = {M On , sn (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Budyak 15</a>)</p>
Given a spectrum E, we have the homomorphisms hk,n : πk (En ) → πk+1 (SEn ) (sn )∗ (sn )∗ −−−→ πk+1 (En+1 ). We deﬁne the homotopy group πk (E) to be the direct limit of the sequence ··· − → πk+n (En ) hk+n,n hk+n,n −−−−→ πk+n+1 (En+1 ) − → ··· , i.e., πk (E) = lim n→∞ πi+n (En ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Budyak 15</a>)</p>
N k = πk (M O), Nk (X) = πk (X + ∧ M O) and so get rid of “N large enough” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Budyak 15</a>)</p>
Every spectrum E yields a homology theory E∗ (−) and a cohomology theory E ∗ (−) by the formulae Ei (X) := lim n→∞ πi+n (X + ∧ En ), E i (X) := lim n→∞ [S n X + , Ei+n ]. Moreover, E∗ (−) and E ∗ (−) are dual to each other. Conversely, every (co)homology theory can be represented by a spectrum via the above formulae. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Budyak 15</a>)</p>
Note that, in particular, the spectrum M O yields the bordism (resp. cobordism) theory N∗ (−) (resp. N∗ (−)). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Budyak 15</a>)</p>
Orientability. We consider in this book orientability with respect to arbitrary cohomology theories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Budyak 15</a>)</p>
Similarly, we deﬁne a locally trivial Rn -bundle ξ over a connected base to be orientable if H n (T ξ) = Z, and an orientation of ξ is a generator of the group H n (T ξ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Budyak 16</a>)</p>
For example, an h-orientation of an Rn -bundle ξ is a suitable element uξ ∈  h  h n (T ξ), an horientation of a closed manifold M n is an element [M ] ∈ hn (M n ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Budyak 16</a>)</p>
Furthermore, one can develop an elegant theory of characteristic classes taking values in h∗ (−) provided that all complex vector bundles are horientable; these classes generalize the classical Chern classes. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Budyak 16</a>)</p>
As the last example, we mention that general orientabilty theory provides a formal group input to algebraic topology; this matter is completely degenerate for classical cohomology, and so this remarkable theory was able to appear only under the general approac (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Budyak 16</a>)</p>

(Co)bordism with singularities. (Co)bordism with singularities is now a common and convenient notion, being a favorite tool as well as subject of research in algebraic topology. Roughly speaking, we take a class of manifolds and extend it to a class of suitable polyhedra (manifolds with singularities) where a notion of a boundary is reasonably deﬁned (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Budyak 16</a>)</p>
Moreover, the famous Morava k-theories are also constructed as certain cobordism with singularities (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Budyak 17</a>)</p>
ories are also constructed as certain cobordism with singularities. I also want to mention an application of (co)bordism with singularities to the topological quantum ﬁeld theory: for example, the elliptic (co)homology can be constructed as (co)bordism with singularities (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Budyak 17</a>)</p>
Finally, (co)bordism with singularities gives a natural geometric ﬂavor to algebraic or homotopical matters. For example, the Adams resolution of certain spectra can be interpreted in terms of (co)bordism with singularities, and this enables us to get useful information about some classical (co)bordism theories, like M SU and M Sp (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Budyak 17</a>)</p>

The paper Thom [2] made a revolution and formed the contemporary paradigm of algebraic topology, and it freshly demonstrated the power and usefulness of the relations between homotopy theory and geometry. In order to exhibit relatively recent advantages of this matter, I just write down a list (unavoidably incomplete) of certain geometric problems which were (partially or completely) solved via an application of homotopy theory. 1 (1) When can a manifold M be immersed in a manifold N , and how can one classify these immersions? (Smale [1], Hirsch [1].) (2) When can a homology class in a space be realized by a map of a closed manifold? (Thom [2].) (3) When is a closed manifold a boundary of a compact manifold with boundary? (Thom [2].) (4) Which spaces are homotopy equivalent to closed smooth manifolds? (Browder [1,2], Novikov [2,3].) (5) How can one classify manifolds up to diﬀeomorphism (PL isomorphism, homeomorphism)? (Smale [1], Kervaire–Milnor [1], Browder [1,2], Novikov [2,3], Hirsch–Mazur [1], Sullivan [1], Kirby–Siebenmann [1], Freedman [1], Donaldson [1].) (6) How many pointwise linearly independent tangent vector ﬁelds exist on the n-dimensional sphere? (Adams [3].) (7) Which smooth manifolds admit a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature? (Gromov–Lawson [1], Stolz [1].)

The category consisting of sets (as objects) and functions (as morphisms) is denoted by E ns. The category of pointed sets and pointed functions is denoted by E ns• .

partially ordered set, or a poset, is a quasi-ordered set with the following condition: if λ ≤ μ ≤ λ then λ = μ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Budyak 20</a>)</p>
A chain in a poset is a family {ai } such that, for every pair i, j of indices, either ai ≤ aj or aj ≤ ai . An upper bound of the chain is any a such that a i ≤ a for every i. A poset is called inductive if every chain in it has an upper bound.

K → E ns is represented by a certain object B of K if there exists a natural equivalence F ∼ = TB . In this case B is called a classifying or representing object for F . Furthermore, F is called representable if it can be represented by some B.

1.4. Deﬁnition. We say that a contravariant functor F : K → E ns is represented by a certain object B of K if there exists a natu (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Budyak 20</a>)</p>
Let F, G : K → E ns be represented by B, C respectively. It is obvious that every morphism f : B → C yields a natural transformation Tf : TB → TC and hence F → G. The converse is also true. ∼ = ∼ = ∼ = ∼ = 1.5. Lemma (Yoneda). Fix natural equivalences b : F −→ TB , c : G −→ TC . For every natural transformation ϕ : F → G there exists a morphism f : B → C such that for every object X of K the diagram ϕ F (X) −−−−→ G(X) ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ b T f T Tf B (X) −−−−→ TC (X) commutes, and such a morphism f is unique. In particular, the representing object B for F is determined by F uniquely up to isomorphism.

The category of abelian groups and homomorphisms is denoted by A G .

In algebraic context, we reserve the word “unit” for the neutral element of a monoid (group). In particular, the multiplicative identity element of a ring is also called the unit.

Given a commutative ring R, we denote by R[x, y, . . . , z] the polynomial ring of indeterminates x, y, . . . , z. The corresponding power series ring is denoted by R[[x, y, . . . , z]]. If R is a graded ring, we assume that x, y, . . . , z are homogeneous indeterminates. Furthermore, ΛR (x, y, . . . , z) denotes the free exterior algebra (with a unit) over R of indeterminates x, y, . . . , z, and for a graded R we assume that x, y, . . . , z have odd degrees. We use the notation Λ(x, y, . . . , z) for the ring ΛZ (x, y, . . . , z).

Let ρ : A → B be a ring homomorphism, and let M be a right Amodule. The homomorphism ρ turns B into a left A-module ρ B, where a·b = ρ(a)b for a ∈ A, b ∈ B, cf. Cartan–Eilenberg [1]. We can therefore form the tensor product over A of A-modules M, B. This tensor product is denoted by M ⊗ρ B (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=21" target="_blank">Budyak 21</a>)</p>
(a) Let K be a category. A direct system over Λ, or brieﬂy, a direct Λsystem, in K is a covariant functor M : Λ → K . In other words, M is a family M = {Mλ , j λμ }λ , μ ∈ Λ, where Mλ ∈ K and where jλμ : Mμ → Mλ for μ ≤ λ are morphisms such that jλμ jμν = jλν for ν ≤ μ ≤ λ and jλλ = 1Mλ . (b) A morphism f : {Mλ , jλμ } → {Nλ , hμλ } of direct Λ-systems is a natural transformation of functors, i.e., a family {fλ : Mλ → Nλ } with hμλ fμ = fλ jλμ .

Given two pairs (X, A), (Y, B) of spaces and a map f : A → B, the space X ∪f Y is deﬁned to be the quotient space (X Y )/ ∼, where ∼ is the smallest equivalence relation generated by the following relation: a ∼ b if f (a) = b for a ∈ A, b ∈ B. We say that the space X ∪f Y is obtained from X by adjoining, or gluing, Y via f . For instance, if Y = pt = B then X ∪f Y ∼ = X/A.

A triad (X; A, B) is a topological space and two of its closed subspaces A, B such that X = A ∪ B. A ﬁltration of a topological space X is a sequence {· · · ⊂ X0 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Xn ⊂ · · · ⊂ X} such that: (1) X = ∪n Xn . (2) Every Xn is closed in X. (3) X inherits the direct limit topology, i.e., U is open in X iﬀ U ∩ Xn is open in Xn for every n.

Given a space X, we denote by X + the disjoint union of X and a point, and the added point is assumed to be the base point. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Budyak 24</a>)</p>
Algebraic topologists prefer to deal with “nice” spaces, such as CW spaces. However, a class of spaces in which algebraic topologists work should be closed under standard operations which topologists use. In other words, the suitable category of spaces should be large enough to accommodate operations and small enough to rule out pathologies at the same time. One such category was suggested by Steenrod [2] and improved by McCord [1]3 , and is known as the category of weak Hausdorﬀ compactly generated spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Budyak 24</a>)</p>
3.2. Deﬁnition. (a) A topological space X is called weak Hausdorﬀ if, for every map ϕ : C → X of a compact space C, the set ϕ(C) is closed in X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Budyak 24</a>)</p>
(b) A subset U of a topological space X is called compactly open if ϕ−1 (U ) is open for every map ϕ : C → X of a compact space C. A topological space X is called compactly generated if each of its compactly open sets is open. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">Budyak 25</a>)</p>
Note that every point of a weak Hausdorﬀ space is closed, and that every Hausdorﬀ space is weak Hausdorﬀ. Thus, the weak Hausdorﬀ property lies between T1 and T2 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">Budyak 25</a>)</p>
Generally speaking, the usual Cartesian product of two spaces from W is not in W . See Dowker [1], §5. Nevertheless, the category W admits products (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">Budyak 26</a>)</p>
3.6. Deﬁnition. Given a family {Xi } of topological spaces, we deﬁne their compactly generated direct product  c Xi := k Xi i i  where is the usual Cartesian product of topological spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">Budyak 26</a>)</p>
Deﬁne the compact-open topology as follows: let ϕ : C → X be a map of a compact space C, and let U be an open set in Y . We denote by W (ϕ, U ) the set of all maps f : X → Y such that f ϕ(C) ⊂ U . Then the family {W (ϕ, U )} for all such pairs (ϕ, U ) forms a subbasis of the compact-open topology on the set of maps from X to Y . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=27" target="_blank">Budyak 27</a>)</p>
(c) The loop space Ω(X, ∗) of a pointed space (X, ∗) is just the pointed space (X, ∗)(S 1 ,∗) where S 1 is the circle. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=27" target="_blank">Budyak 27</a>)</p>
3.11. Convention. Throughout the book we will assume that all spaces belong to W unless somthing else is said explicitly, i.e., the word “space” means “weak Hausdorﬀ compactly generated space”. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=27" target="_blank">Budyak 27</a>)</p>
3.12. Basic homotopy theory. (a) Two maps f, g : X → Y are called homotopic if there is a map (homotopy, or deformation) H : X × I → Y such that H|X × {0} = f and H|X × {1} = (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Budyak 28</a>)</p>
(b) A map f : X → Y is called a homotopy equivalence if there is a map g : Y → X such that gf  1X and f g  1Y . In this case we say that f and g are homotopy inverse to each other. Two spaces X, Y are called homotopy equivalent if there is a homotopy equivalence X → Y , and we write X  Y . The homotopy type of a space X is the class of all spaces homotopy equivalent to X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Budyak 28</a>)</p>
(c) By saying that two maps f, g : (X, A) → (Y, B) are homotopic we mean that there exists a homotopy (X × I, A × I) → (Y, B). Furthermore, we say that two maps f, g : (X, A) → (Y, B) are homotopic relative to A, and write f  g rel A, if there is a homotopy H : f  g such that H(a, t) = f (a) for every a ∈ A, t ∈ I (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Budyak 28</a>)</p>
3.13. Deﬁnition. We say that a map is essential if it is not homotopic to a constant map. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Budyak 28</a>)</p>
3.14. Deﬁnition. Let H W denote the category whose objects are the same as those of W but whose morphisms are the homotopy classes of maps. Clearly, every diagram in W yields a diagram in H W . We say that a diagram in W is homotopy commutative if the corresponding diagram in H W is commutative (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Budyak 28</a>)</p>
(a) The mapping cylinder, or just the cylinder, of f is the space M f := X × [0, 1] ∪f Y, f where f is considered as the map X × {0} = X − → Y . Recall that there is a standard deformation F : M f × I → Y where F ((x, t), s) = (x, st) if (x, t) ∈ X × (0, 1] and s > 0 F ((x, t), 0) = f (x) if (x, t) ∈ X × (0, 1] F (y, s) = y if y ∈ Y.    Note that F  M f × {0} : M f → Y is a retraction and F   M f × {1} = 1Mf , i.e., Y is a deformation retract of M f . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">Budyak 29</a>)</p>
(b) The mapping cone, or the coﬁber, or just the cone, of f is the space Cf := M f /(X × {1}). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">Budyak 29</a>)</p>
3.18. Deﬁnition. (a) Given two maps f : X → Y and g : X → Z, the double f g mapping cylinder of the diagram Y ← −X − → Z is the space D := X × [0, 2] ∪ϕ (Y Z) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">Budyak 29</a>)</p>
For instance, Cf is (homeomorphic to) the double mapping cylinder of f the diagram Y ← −X − → pt. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Budyak 30</a>)</p>
(b) The mapping cone of the constant map X → pt is called the suspension over a space X and denoted by SX (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Budyak 30</a>)</p>
. Thus, the suspension is the double mapping cylinder of the diagram pt ← − X − → p (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Budyak 30</a>)</p>
(c) The mapping cylinder of the trivial map X → pt is denoted by CX. So, Cf = CX ∪f Y , and SX = CX/X × {1}. (d) The join X ∗ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Budyak 30</a>)</p>
∗ Y of the spaces X, Y is deﬁned to be the double mapping cylinder of the diagram p1 p2 X ←− X × Y −→ Y. For instance, X ∗ S 0 = SX (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Budyak 30</a>)</p>
fn−1 fn fn+1 3.19. Deﬁnition. Given a sequence X = {· · · −−−→ Xn −→ Xn+1 −−−→ · · · } of maps, deﬁne its telescope T X to be the space   T X := (Xn × [n, n + 1]) ∼, where under ∼, (x, n + 1) ∈ Xn × [n, n + 1] is identiﬁed with (fn (x), n + 1) ∈ X n+1 × [n + 1, n + 2].

3.20. Deﬁnition. Let {(Xi , xi )} be a family of pointed spaces. (a) The pointed direct product is the pointed space    (X i , xi ) := Xi , ∗  where ∗ is the point {xi }. (b) The wedge is the pointed space     i Xi (X Xi i , xi ) := i ,∗ . ∪i {xi } i where ∗ is the image of ∪i {xi }.

(c) The obvious injective maps (Xi , xi ) → Xi , ∗ yield an injective map   (∨i Xi , ∗) → Xi , ∗ . Generally speaking, this map is not closed, but it is closed for a ﬁnite set of spaces. So, given two pointed spaces (X, ∗), (Y, ∗), we deﬁne the smash product (X, ∗) × (Y, ∗) (X, ∗) × (Y, ∗) (X, ∗) ∧ (Y, ∗) := . (X, ∗) ∨ (Y, ∗) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">Budyak 31</a>)</p>
3.21. Deﬁnition. Let {(Xi , xi )} be a family of copies of a pointed space (X, x). We deﬁne the folding map π : ∨(Xi , xi ) → X, to be the unique map π such that π|Xi = 1X .

3.23. Deﬁnition. (a) The reduced mapping cylinder of a pointed map f : (X, ∗) → (Y, ∗) is the space M f = (X × [0, 1] ∪f Y )/(∗ × [0, 1]). Note that the base points of X and Y yield the same point ∗ ∈ M f ; we agree that ∗ is the base point of M f . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">Budyak 31</a>)</p>
(b) The reduced mapping cone of f is deﬁned to be Cf = M f /(X × {1}). It is a pointed space in the obvious way: its base point is the image of the base point of M f . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=32" target="_blank">Budyak 32</a>)</p>
(c) The reduced mapping cone of the constant map (X, ∗) → (pt, ∗) is called the reduced suspension over a space X and denoted by SX. Furthermore, we can deﬁne the iterated reduced suspension S n X, and S n turns out to be a functor on W • , see 3.18(e).

3.24. Deﬁnition. Given a pair (X, A), the inclusion i : A → X is called a coﬁbration if it satisﬁes the homotopy extension property, i.e., given maps g : X → Y and F : A × I → Y such that F |A × {0} = g|A, there is a map G : X × I → Y such that G|X × {0} = g and G|A × I = F . In this case we also say that (X, A) is a coﬁbered pair.

3.25. Proposition. (i) (X, A) is a coﬁbered pair iﬀ every map h : X × {0} ∪ A × I → Y can be extended to a map X × I → Y .

3.26. Proposition. (i) For every map f : X → Y , the inclusion i : X = X × {1} → M f is a coﬁbration. In particular, every map is homotopy equivalent to a coﬁbration. (ii) Let (X, A) be a coﬁbered pair. Then Ci  X/A. (iii) Let (X, A) be a coﬁbered pair. If A is contractible then the collapsing map c : X → X/A is a homotopy equivalence.

3.28. Deﬁnition. A pointed space (X, x0 ) is called well-pointed if (X, {x0 }) is a coﬁbered pair.

3.29. Lemma (Puppe [1]). Let f : (X, x0 ) → (Y, y0 ) be a pointed map of well-pointed spaces. If f : X → Y is a homotopy equivalence then f : (X, x0 ) → (Y, y0 ) is a pointed homotopy equivalence.

(c) A long coﬁber sequence is a sequence (ﬁnite or not) ··· − → Xi − → Xi+1 − → Xi+2 − → ··· where every pair of adjacent morphisms forms a coﬁber sequence.

u v 3.38. Deﬁnition. (a) A strict coﬁber sequence is a diagram A − →B − →C where u : A → B is a map and v is the canonical inclusion as in (3.17). f g (b) A sequence X − →Y − → Z is called a coﬁber sequence if there exists a homotopy commutative diagram f g X −−−−→ Y −−−−→ Z ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ c ⏐ a b c u v A −−−−→ B −−−−→ C such that all the vertical arrows are homotopy equivalences and the bottom row is a strict coﬁber sequenc (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=36" target="_blank">Budyak 36</a>)</p>
3.39. Proposition. Let f : X → Y be an arbitrary map of pointed spaces, and let g : Y → Cf = Z be the canonical inclusion. Then C(g)  SX = S 1 ∧ X. Moreover, there is a long coﬁber sequence n f Sn f g Sf Sg Sn f Sn g X− →Y − →Z− → SX −−→ SY −→ · · · − → S n X −−→ S n Y −−→ · · · .

Proposition 3.39 was originally proved by Puppe [1]. Because of this, the long coﬁber sequence is often refered to as the Puppe sequence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Budyak 37</a>)</p>
Recall that a map f : X → Y of CW -complexes is called cellular if f (X (n) ) ⊂ Y (n) for every n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Budyak 37</a>)</p>
3.41. Theorem. (i) Let i : X (n) → X be the inclusion. Then i∗ : π i (X (n) , ∗) → πi (X, ∗) is an isomorphism for i < n and an epimorphism for i = n. (ii) Every map f : X → Y of CW -complexes is homotopic to a cellular map. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Budyak 37</a>)</p>
We recall that i : A → X is a coﬁbration for every CW -pair (X, A). In particular, every pointed CW -space is well-pointed, and so we can safely omit base points from notation. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Budyak 37</a>)</p>
Every CW -space is Hausdorﬀ (and so weak Hausdorﬀ) and compactly generated. Thus, when we talk about products (or smash products) of CW complexes we follow 3.6. Then the direct product X × Y and the smash product X ∧ Y of two CW -spaces X, Y are also CW -spaces. Note that, for every cellular map f : X → Y , the spaces M f and Cf are CW -complexes in an obvious canonical way, see e.g. Fritsch–Piccinini [1]. In particular, the suspension SX of a CW -complex X is a CW -complex.

(b) A map f : X → Y is called a Whitehead equivalence if f∗ : π n (X, x0 ) → πn (Y, f (x0 )) is a bijection for every n ≥ 0 and every x0 ∈ X.

We say that two spaces X, Y are CW -equivalent if there is a sequence a 0 a1 ai−1 ai an−1 a0 a1 ai X = X0 −−−− X1 −−−− · · · −−−−− − Xi −−−− · · · −−−−− − Xn = Y where every ai is a Whitehead equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">Budyak 38</a>)</p>
3.43. Remark. Traditionally, CW -equivalences, as well as Whitehead equivalences, are called weak equivalences. We refrain from using this terminology in this book because these names are not quite compatible with the concept of weak homotopy (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">Budyak 38</a>)</p>
3.44. Proposition–Deﬁnition. For every topological space X, there is a Whitehead equivalence f : Y → X where Y is a CW -space. Every such CW space Y is called a CW -substitute for X.

1.1. Deﬁnition. (a) A spectrum E is a sequence {En , sn }, n ∈ Z, of CW complexes En and CW -embeddings sn : SEn → En+1 (i.e., sn (SEn ) is a subcomplex of En+1 ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=42" target="_blank">Budyak 42</a>)</p>
(e) For every CW -complex X the spectrum Σ∞ X is deﬁned as follows:  pt, if n < 0, ∞ (Σ∞ X)n = S n X, if n ≥ 0, and sn : S(S n X) → S n+1 X, for n ≥ 0, are the identity maps. For example, the spectrum Σ∞ S 0 is the sphere spectrum {S n , in }, where i n : SS = n −→ S n+1 .

1.2. Deﬁnition. (a) A cell of a spectrum E is a sequence {e, Se, . . . , S k e, . . . } where e is a cell of any En such that e is not the suspension of any cell of E n−1 . If e is a cell of En of dimension d then the dimension of the cell {e, Se, . . . , S k e, . . . } of E is d − n. Furthermore, the base points of En ’s yield the cell of dimension −∞.

(b) A subspectrum F of a spectrum E is coﬁnal (in E) if every cell of E is eventually in F , i.e., for every cell e of En there exists m such that S m e belongs to Fn+m .

(g) A suspension spectrum is a spectrum of the form Σk Σ∞ X where X is a pointed space and k ∈ Z.

1.3. Deﬁnition. (a) Let E = {En , sn } and F = {Fn , tn } be two spectra. A map f from E to F (i.e., a map f : E → F ) is a family of pointed cellular maps fn : En → Fn such that fn+1 sn = tn ◦Sfn for all n.

Let S = Σ∞ S 0 be the spectrum of spheres. The group [Σk S, E] is called the k-th homotopy group of E and denoted by πk (E). It is easy to see that π k (E) = lim πk+N (EN ) where the direct limit is that of the direct system N →∞ (sN )∗ · · · → πk+N (EN ) → πk+N +1 (SEN ) −−−→ πk+N +1 (EN +1 ) → · · · , (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">Budyak 45</a>)</p>
1.9. Deﬁnition. (a) Two maps g0 , g1 : E → F of spectra are called homotopic if there exists a map G : E ∧ I + → F (called a homotopy) such that G coincides with gi on the subspectrum E ∧ {i, ∗}, i = 0, 1, of E. In this case we write g0  g1 or G : g0  g1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">Budyak 45</a>)</p>
(b) Two morphisms ϕ0 , ϕ1 : E → F of spectra are called homotopic, if there exists a coﬁnal subspectrum E  of E and two maps gi : E  → F, gi ∈ ϕ i , i = 0, 1, such that g0 |E   g1 |E  . It is straightforward to show that homotopic morphisms form equivalence classes, and in particular we can deﬁne the homotopy class [ϕ] of a morphism ϕ to be the set of all morphisms homotopic to ϕ. The set of all homotopy classes of morphisms E → F is denoted by [E, F ].

Thus, we can deﬁne a category H S with spectra as objects and sets [E, F ] as sets of morphisms. Isomorphisms of H S are called equivalences (of spectra), and we use the notation E  F when E is equivalent to (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">Budyak 45</a>)</p>

In particular, if E = Σ∞ X then π k (E) is just the stable homotopy group Πk (X) (denoted also by πkst (X)) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">Budyak 46</a>)</p>
An analog of the Whitehead Theorem is valid for spectra. 1.10. Theorem. A morphism ϕ : E → F is an equivalence iﬀ the induced homomorphism ϕ∗ : πk (E) → πk (F ) is an isomorphism for every integer k. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">Budyak 46</a>)</p>
One of the important advantages of the category H S is that the suspension operator is invertible there. 1.11. Proposition. The spectra S 1 ∧ E and ΣE are equivalent. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">Budyak 46</a>)</p>
1.12. Deﬁnition. (a) A strict coﬁber sequence of spectra is a diagram ϕ ψ E− →F − → Cϕ where ϕ : E → F is a morphism of spectra (resp. map of spaces) and ψ is a canonical inclusion as in 1.7(b). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">Budyak 46</a>)</p>
1.14. Proposition. For every spectrum F the function  {i∗ λ } : [∨λ E(λ), F ] → [E(λ), F ], where {i∗λ }(f ) = {f iλ }, λ is a bijection.

f g 1.13. Lemma. (i) If X − → Y − → Z is a coﬁber sequence of spectra, then f g h there exists a map h : Z → ΣX such that X − →Y − →Z − → ΣX is a long coﬁber sequence.

Since [E, F ] = [Σ2 E, Σ2 F ] = [S 2 ∧ E, Σ2 F ] (the last equality follows from 1.11), [E, F ] admits a natural structure of an abelian group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">Budyak 48</a>)</p>
Thus, H S is an additive category. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">Budyak 48</a>)</p>
f g In view of 1.11 and 1.13(i), every coﬁber sequence X − →Y − → Z yields a long coﬁber sequence −1 . . . → Σ −1 Y Σ−1 g f g Σf −−−→ Σ−1 Z − →X − →Y − → Z → ΣX −−→ ΣY − → ··· .

The ﬁrst of the above sequences is similar to a sequence which holds for a coﬁbration X → Y with coﬁber Z , while the second one is similar to a sequence which holds for a ﬁbration X → Y with ﬁber Σ−1 Z . Thus, the diﬀerence between ﬁbrations and coﬁbrations disappears in the category H S . For this reason we call Σ −1 Cϕ the fiber of a morphism ϕ.

Hence, the element 1X ⊕ 1X of the right hand side yields a (unique up to homotopy) morphism ∇ : X → X ∨ X. We leave it to the reader to show that addition in [X, E] is given by the composition ∼ = ∇∗ ∼ = ∇∗ [X, E] ⊕ [X, E] −→ [X ∨ X, E] −−→ [X, E]. Because of this, we call ∇ coaddition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=49" target="_blank">Budyak 49</a>)</p>

1.18. Deﬁnition. A prespectrum is a family {Xn , tn }, n ∈ Z, of pointed spaces Xn and pointed maps tn : SXn → Xn+1 . A CW -prespectrum is a prespectrum {Xn , tn } such that every Xn is a CW -complex and every tn is a cellular map. 1.19. Lemma–Deﬁnition.

1.20. Deﬁnition. A prespectrum X = {Xn , tn } is called an Ω-prespectrum if for every n the map τn : Xn → ΩXn+1 adjoint to tn is a homotopy equivalence. A spectrum is called an Ω-spectrum if it is an Ω-prespectrum. 1.21. Proposition (cf. Adams [5]). Every spectrum E = {En , sn } is equivalent to some Ω-spectrum.

Some authors have developed a ﬁner theory by indexing terms of a spectrum not by integers but by ﬁnite dimensional subspaces of R∞ . This approach was suggested by Puppe [2] and May [3]. Such spectra are very useful for working with some ﬁne geometry. However, the foundations of this theory are quite complicated. For our purposes, the mass of preliminaries outweighs the gain; thus we do not use these spectra here and so do not dwell on them. However, they seem to be very useful for advanced homotopy theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">Budyak 54</a>)</p>
One can introduce a smash product E ∧ F of spectra E, F as a generalization of the smash product E ∧ X of a spectrum and a space.

2.3. Deﬁnition. (a) A morphism u : S → A ∧ A⊥ is called a duality morphism, or simply a duality, between spectra A and A⊥ if for every spectrum E the homomorphisms u E : [A, E] → [S, E ∧ A ⊥ ], uE (ϕ) = (ϕ ∧ 1A⊥ )u and u E : [A⊥ , E] → [S, A ∧ E], uE (ϕ) = (1A ∧ ϕ)u are isomorphisms. (b) A spectrum A⊥ is called dual to a spectrum A if there exists a duality S → A ∧ A⊥ . By 2.1(ii), in this case A is dual to A⊥ . So, “to be dual” is a symmetric relation.

2.12. Deﬁnition. (a) A ring spectrum is a triple (E, μ, ι) where E is a spectrum and μ : E ∧ E → E (the multiplication) and ι : S → E (the unit morphism, or the unit) are certain morphisms with the following properties: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=60" target="_blank">Budyak 60</a>)</p>

it was noticed that many useful constructions of algebraic topology (K-functor, (co)bordism, etc.) are formally similar to (co)homology theories. Afterwards the reason for this phenomenon was clariﬁed: namely, most of these constructions satisfy all the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms except the so-called dimension axiom. So, it seemed reasonable to consider the objects satisfying these axioms. These objects were called extraordinary (co)homology theories. However, later mathematicians came to call these objects just (co)homology theories, while H(−; G) got the name ordinary (co)homology theory. 5 Now this terminology is commonly accepted, and we use it in this book.

It is easy to see that we have a category of homology theories and their morphisms. In particular, the equivalence (isomorphism) of homology theories is deﬁned in the usual way: it is a morphism of homology theories which is also a natural equivalence of functors.

This proposition shows that there is a bijective correspondence between unreduced and reduced homology theories.

It is possible and useful to introduce (co)homology theories on spectra. Consider the following full subcategories of S : Sfd : its objects are all ﬁnite dimensional spectra; Ss : its objects are all suspension spectra; Ssfd : its objects are all spectra of the form Σn Σ∞ X, n ∈ Z, X ∈ Cfd • ; Sf : its objects are all ﬁnite spectra. 3.10.

(iii) Let A, B be two subspectra of a spectrum X. Set C = A ∩ B.

By 1.15 and 2.1(vi), (En , sn ) is a homology theory on S , and, by 1.16(iii) and 2.1(v), it is additive.

hus, every spectrum yields a (co)homology theory on S (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Budyak 78</a>)</p>
. So, we have a functor from spectra to (co)homology theories. In particular, equivalent spectra yield isomorphic (co)homology theories. According to 3.22, one can assign a (co)homology theory to a spectrum. This situation turns out to be invertible, see Ch. III, §3 below. ∗ 3.23. Proposition. For every spectrum E, the cohomology theory E ∗ is dual to the homology theory E∗ .

this section we develop the homotopy theory of spectra. Namely, we discuss Postnikov towers, Cartan killing constructions, Serre theory of classes of abelian group, etc., for spectra. (We assume that the reader knows these notions in the case of spaces; otherwise he can ﬁnd them e.g. in Mosher– Tangora [1].) Closely related material is exposed in Dold [3] and Margolis [1].

4.9. Theorem (the Universal Coeﬃcient Theorem). For every spectrum E and every abelian group G, there are exact sequences 0 → Ext(Hn−1 (E), G) → H n (E; G) → Hom(Hn (E), G) → 0 and 0 → Hn (E) ⊗ G → Hn (E; G) → Tor(Hn−1 (E), G) → 0. In particular, H0 (H(A); B) ∼ = A ⊗ B, H 0 (H(A); B) ∼ = ∼ = Hom(A, B).

4.11. Theorem (the Künneth Theorem). Let k be a ﬁeld, and let E, F be a pair of spectra. (i) The homomorphism μ E,F : H∗ (E; k) ⊗ H∗ (F ; k) → H∗ (E ∧ F ; k) is an isomorphism. In particular,  H n (E ∧ F ; k) ∼ = ∼ = Hi (E; k) ⊗k Hj (F ; k). i+j=n (ii) Assume that E is bounded below and F has ﬁnite type. Then the homomorphism μ E,F : H ∗ (E; k) ⊗ H ∗ (F ; k) → H ∗ (E ∧ F ; k) is an isomorphism. In particular,  H n (E ∧ F ; k) ∼ = ∼ = H i (E; k) ⊗k H j (F ; k). i+j=n (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">Budyak 93</a>)</p>
4.12. Deﬁnition. A Postnikov tower of a spectrum E is a homotopy commutative diagram of spectra (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Budyak 94</a>)</p>
4.13. Theorem. Every spectrum E has a Postnikov tower (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Budyak 94</a>)</p>
4.19. Deﬁnition. The element κn ∈ H n+1 (E(n−1) ; πn (E)) is called the n-th Postnikov invariant of E. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">Budyak 97</a>)</p>
Now we apply the Serre class theory (see Serre [1], Mosher–Tangora [1]) to spectra. C (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">Budyak 98</a>)</p>
4.21. Deﬁnition. (a) A Serre class is a family of abelian groups C satisfying the following axiom: If 0 → A  → A → A → 0 is a short exact sequence, then A is in C iﬀ both A and A are in C. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">Budyak 98</a>)</p>
C iﬀ both A and A are in C. (b) Let H(A) denote the Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum of an abelian group A. A Serre class is called stable if it satisﬁes the following axiom: If A ∈ C, then Hi (H(A)) ∈ C for every i. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">Budyak 98</a>)</p>
4.23. Proposition. (i) The class of all ﬁnite abelian groups is a stable Serre class. (ii) The class of all ﬁnitely generated abelian groups is a stable Serre class. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">Budyak 98</a>)</p>
(iii) Given a prime p, let C be the class of all abelian groups having pprimary exponents (i.e., for every A ∈ C there exists k such that pk A = 0). Then C is a stable Serre class. (iv) Given a prime p, the class of all ﬁnite p-primary abelian groups is a stable Serre class. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">Budyak 99</a>)</p>
4.32. Theorem-Deﬁnition. For every abelian group A, there exists a spectrum M (A) with the following properties: (i) πi (M (A)) = 0 for i < 0; (ii) π0 (M (A)) = A = H0 (M (A)); (iii) Hi (M (A)) = 0 for i = 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=104" target="_blank">Budyak 104</a>)</p>
Moreover, these properties determine M (A) uniquely up to equivalence. This spectrum M (A) is called the Moore spectrum of the abelian grou (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=104" target="_blank">Budyak 104</a>)</p>
Let Q be the ﬁeld of rational numbers. Let p be a prime, and let Z[p] be the subring of Q consisting of all irreducible fractions with denominators relatively prime to p. The Z[p]-localization of an abelian group A is the homomorphism A → A ⊗ Z[p], a → a ⊗ 1. The group A ⊗ Z[p] is simpler than A in a certain sense: for example, it has no q-torsion if (p, q) = 1. On the other hand, if we know the groups A ⊗ Z[p] for all p then we can obtain a lot of information about A; for example, if A is ﬁnitely generated then it is completely determined by the groups A ⊗ Z[p], where p runs through all primes. So, we can describe an abelian group A via descriptions of the simpler groups A ⊗ Z[p], and this trick is very eﬀective. For example, it is ∗ very convenient to describe the ring H ∗ (HZ) of cohomology operations via the rings H ∗ (HZ[p]; Z[p]). Also, localization enables us to ignore the torsions which are irrelevant to a particular problem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=106" target="_blank">Budyak 106</a>)</p>
More generally, it makes sense to consider subrings Λ of Q. In this case the localization A → A ⊗ Λ deletes the q-torsion with q ∈ S, where S is the set of denominators of all irreducible fractions of Λ. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=106" target="_blank">Budyak 106</a>)</p>
It is remarkable that the localization can be transferred from algebra to topology, and, in particular, one can consider the Z[p]-homotopy type of a space and a spectrum (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=106" target="_blank">Budyak 106</a>)</p>
Let Λ be a subring of Q ; its additive group is also denoted by Λ. Let π be an abelian group. π 5.1. Deﬁnition. The homomorphism l = lΛ : π → π ⊗ Λ, a → a ⊗ 1 is called the Λ-localization of π. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=106" target="_blank">Budyak 106</a>)</p>
f g 5.3. Proposition. If E − → F − → G is a coﬁber sequence of spectra then E fΛ gΛ Λ −→ FΛ −→ GΛ is. In particular, C(fΛ ) = (Cf )Λ for every morphism f : E → F of spectra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=107" target="_blank">Budyak 107</a>)</p>
5.5. Corollary. There are natural isomorphisms π i (EΛ ) ∼ = πi (E) ⊗ Λ, Hi (EΛ ) ∼ = Hi (E) ⊗ Λ j∗ such that the homomorphisms πi (E) −→ πi (EΛ ) ∼ πi (E) = ⊗ Λ, Hi (E) −j→ ∗ H i (EΛ ) ∼ = ∼ = Hi (E)⊗Λ have the form x → x⊗1. So, j Λ-localizes homotopy and homology groups. In particular, every Λ-local spectrum has Λ-local homotopy and homology groups. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=108" target="_blank">Budyak 108</a>)</p>
5.7. Lemma. Let E be an arbitrary spectrum, and let Cj be the cone of the localization j : E → EΛ . Then H ∗ (Cj; π) = 0 for every Λ-local group π. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=110" target="_blank">Budyak 110</a>)</p>
This proposition enables us to construct localizations via Postnikov towers. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=112" target="_blank">Budyak 112</a>)</p>
This approach enables us to construct the localization of spaces also. The main results of this theory are Theorems 5.12 and 5.13 below (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=112" target="_blank">Budyak 112</a>)</p>
5.12. Theorem–Deﬁnition. For every simple space X there exist a simple space XΛ and a map j = jΛX : X → XΛ such that the homomorphisms π i (X) −→ πi (XΛ ) ∼ = j∗ ∼ = π i (X) ⊗ Λ and Hi (X) −→ Hi (XΛ ) j∗ ∼ = Hi (X) ⊗ Λ have the form x → x ⊗ 1. So, j localizes homotopy and homology groups. Every such a map j is called localization of X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=112" target="_blank">Budyak 112</a>)</p>
As in 5.2, a simple space X is called Λ-local if j : X → XΛ is a homotopy equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=112" target="_blank">Budyak 112</a>)</p>
5.13. Theorem–Deﬁnition. For every two simple spaces X, Y the following conditions are equivalent: (i) The map f : X → Y Λ-localizes homotopy groups; (ii) The map f : X → Y Λ-localizes homology groups; (iii) For every Λ-local space Z the map f ∗ : [Y, Z] → [X, Z] is a bijection. If some (and hence all) of these conditions hold then there exists a homotopy equivalence h : XΛ → Y with f = hjΛX . Furthermore, in this case we say that f localizes X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=113" target="_blank">Budyak 113</a>)</p>
5.14. Lemma.

6.1. Deﬁnition. (a) An algebra over R (or simply an R-algebra) is a triple (A, μ, η), where A is an R-module and μ : A ⊗ A → A, η : R → A are R-homomorphisms such that the diagrams μ⊗1 η⊗1 1⊗η A ⊗ A ⊗ A −−−−→ A ⊗ A R ⊗ A −−−−→ A ⊗ A ←−−−− A ⊗ R ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ 1⊗μ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐μ ⏐ ⏐μ ⏐∼ =⏐ ∼ ⏐= ⏐ ⏐μ ⏐∼ =⏐ ∼ ⏐= μ A⊗A −−−−→ A A A A ∼ commute. Here = denotes the canonical isomorphisms R ∼ ⊗ A = ∼ ∼ = A = A ⊗ R, e.g., A ∼ = A ⊗ R has the form a → a ⊗ 1. Furthermore, μ is called the multiplication and η is called the unit homomorphism. An algebra (A, μ, η) is commutative if μTA,A = μ.

(b) A (left) module over an R-algebra (A, μ, η) is a pair (M, ϕ), where M is an R-module and ϕ : A ⊗ M → M is an R-homomorphism such that the following diagrams commute: μ⊗1 A ⊗ A ⊗ M −−−−→ A ⊗ M ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ 1⊗ϕ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ϕ ϕ A⊗M −−−−→ M ϕ A ⊗ M −−−−→ M ⏐ ⏐ ⏐∼ η⊗1⏐ ⏐= R⊗M R ⊗ M. As usual, we shall simply say “algebra A” or “A-module M ”, omitting μ, η, ϕ, and we shall write ab instead of μ(a ⊗ b) and am instead of ϕ(a ⊗ m) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=116" target="_blank">Budyak 116</a>)</p>

6.4. Deﬁnition. An augmented R-algebra is a quadruple (A, μ, η, ε), where (A, μ, η) is an R-algebra and ε : A → R is a homomorphism of R-algebras (called the augmentation). An augmented algebra (A, μ, η, ε) is called connected if Ai = 0 for i < 0 and ε|A0 : A0 → R is an isomorphism.

6.5. Deﬁnition. Let A be a connected R-algebra, and let Ā be the Rsubmodule consisting of all elements of positive degrees. The ideal ĀĀ is denoted by Dec A, and its elements are called decomposable elements of A. Given an A-module M , let GM denote the factor module M/ĀM . Furthermore, GĀ := Ā/ Dec A usually is denoted by QA and is called (not very aptly) the set of indecomposable elements of A.

6.7. Deﬁnition. (a) A coalgebra over R is a triple (C, Δ, ε), where C is an R-module and Δ : C → C ⊗ C, ε : C → R are R-homomorphisms such that the diagrams Δ C −−−−→ C ⊗C C C C ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ Δ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ Δ⊗1 ∼ = ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐∼ Δ = 1⊗Δ ε⊗1 1⊗ε C ⊗ C −−−−→ C ⊗ C ⊗ C R ⊗ C ←−−−− C ⊗ C −−−−→ C ⊗ R commute. Here Δ is called the comultiplication, or the diagonal map, or just the diagonal, and ε is called the augmentation, or the counit homomorphism. A coalgebra (C, Δ, ε) is cocommutative if TC,C Δ = Δ.

The duality between algebras and coalgebras is exhibited not only in the deﬁning diagrams. For instance, let R be a ﬁeld k. Given a k-vector space C, ∗ consider the dual vector space C ∗ = Homk (C, k). If C is a k-algebra (C, μ, η) ∗ obtains a natural k-coalgebra structure (C ∗ then C ∗ obtains a natural k-coalgebra structure (C ∗ , Δ, ε) provided that every component Cn of C is a ﬁnite dimensional k-vector space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=118" target="_blank">Budyak 118</a>)</p>
Namely, Δ(f )(a ⊗ b) = f (ab), ε = η ∗ : C ∗ → k ∗ = k. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=118" target="_blank">Budyak 118</a>)</p>
6.8. Lemma. For every C-comodule (V, ψ), the function t : HomC (V, C ⊗ M ) → HomR (V, M ), t(f ) = (ε ⊗ 1)f, is bijective. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=118" target="_blank">Budyak 118</a>)</p>
6.9. Deﬁnition. A coalgebra (C, Δ, ε) is called connected if Ci = 0 for i < 0 and ε|C0 : C0 → R is an isomorphism. In this case the element v = ε−1 (1) is called the counit of C. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=119" target="_blank">Budyak 119</a>)</p>
6.11. Examples. (a) Let p be a prime, and let (E, μ, ι) be a ring spectrum of ﬁnite Z[p]-type. Then H ∗ (E; Z/p) has the natural structure of a Z/pcoalgebra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=119" target="_blank">Budyak 119</a>)</p>
(b) If the ring spectrum (E, μ, ι) in (a) is commutative then H ∗ (E; Z/p) is a cocommutative coalgebra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=119" target="_blank">Budyak 119</a>)</p>
(c) If E is a spectrum as in (a) and F is any E-module spectrum of ﬁnite Z[p]-type, then H ∗ (F ; Z/p) admits a structure of a comodule over H ∗ (E; Z/p). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=119" target="_blank">Budyak 119</a>)</p>
(e) For every CW -space X and every ﬁeld k we have a coalgebra H∗ (X; k) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=120" target="_blank">Budyak 120</a>)</p>
∗ (f) Dually to (e), H ∗ (X; k) is a k-algebra for every ﬁeld k and CW -space X of ﬁnite type.

6.12. Deﬁnition. Let (C, Δ, ε) be a connected coalgebra with counit v. (a) An element m ∈ C is called primitive if Δ(m) = m ⊗ v + v ⊗ m. The set (in fact, R-submodule) of all primitive elements of C is denoted by Pr C. (b) Let (V, ψ) be a C-comodule. An element m ∈ V is called simple if ψ(m) = v ⊗ m. The R-submodule of simple elements of V is denoted by Si V .

6.13. Remarks. (a) Under the duality between algebras and coalgebras over a ﬁeld, Pr C is dual to QC ∗ . (b) Sometimes simple elements are also called primitive, but we do not like this because of the danger of confusion: Pr C = Si C where C is regarded as a coalgebra on the left and as comodule on the right.

6.18. Deﬁnition. Let M be a free R-module. Given a coalgebra (C, Δ, ε), deﬁne its cofree M -extension to be the C-comodule (V, ψ) where V = C ⊗ M and ψ(c ⊗ x) = Δ(c) ⊗ x, c ∈ C, x ∈ M . A C-comodule V is called cofree if there is M such that V is isomorphic to the cofree M -extension of C.

6.22. Deﬁnition. A Hopf algebra over R is a quintuple (A, μ, η, Δ, ε) such that (A, μ, η, ε) is an augmented R-algebra, (A, Δ, ε) is an R-coalgebra, Δ : A → A ⊗ A and ε : A → R are homomorphisms of algebras, and η : R → A is a homomorphism of coalgebras.

Note that if A is a Hopf algebra over a ﬁeld k and if dimk An < ∞ for every n then A∗ = Hom(A, k) is a Hopf algebra also (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=122" target="_blank">Budyak 122</a>)</p>
6.24. Deﬁnition. Let A be a Hopf algebra over R. (a) An A-module algebra is a quadruple (M, μ, η, ϕ), where (M, μ, η) is an R-algebra and (M, ϕ) is an A-module such that μ : M ⊗ M → M is a homomorphism of A-modules and ϕ : A ⊗ M → M is a homomorphism of R-algebras. A homomorphism of A-module algebras is a homomorphism of A-modules which is at the same time a homomorphism of R-algebras. (b) An A-comodule algebra is a quadruple (M, μ, η, ψ), where (M, μ, η) is an R-algebra and (M, ψ) is an A-comodule such that μ : M ⊗ M → M is a homomorphism of A-comodules and ψ : M → A ⊗ M is a homomorphism of R-algebras. (c) An A-module coalgebra is a quadruple (V, Δ, ε, ϕ), where (V, Δ, ε) is an R-coalgebra and (V, ϕ) is an A-module such that Δ : V → V ⊗ V is a homomorphism of A-modules and ϕ : A ⊗ V → V is a homomorphism of R-coalgebras.

6.25. Recollection. A very important example of a Hopf algebra over the ﬁeld Z/p, p prime, is the Steenrod algebra  Ap = H ∗ (HZ/p; Z/p) = [HZ/p, Σd HZ/p].

All that we need to know about Ap can be found in Steenrod–Epstein [1], Margolis [1]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=124" target="_blank">Budyak 124</a>)</p>

The Steenrod algebra Ap , p > 2, is generated by elements β (the Bockstein homomorphism) and P i , dim β = 1, dim P i = 2i(p − 1), i = 1, 2, . . .

Note that the Hopf algebra Ap∗ can be described as H∗ (H), where H = HZ/p. T (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=125" target="_blank">Budyak 125</a>)</p>
27. Examples. (a) For every H-space X and every ﬁeld k, we have a Hopf algebra H∗ (X; k): t (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=125" target="_blank">Budyak 125</a>)</p>
Similarly, H ∗ (X; k) is a Hopf algebra for every H-space X of ﬁnite ∗ type, and H∗ (X; k) is the Hopf algebra dual to H ∗ (X; k).

For every spectrum E, the group H ∗ (E) admits a natural Ap -module struct (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=125" target="_blank">Budyak 125</a>)</p>
Furthermore, if E is a ring spectrum of ﬁnite Zor Z[p]-type then H ∗ (E) is a coalgebra over the Hopf algebra Ap , (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=126" target="_blank">Budyak 126</a>)</p>

6.29. Theorem. Let A be a connected Hopf algebra over a ﬁeld k, let C be a connected module coalgebra over A, and let v be the counit of C. Let p : C → GC be the canonical epimorphism (see 6.5), and let λ : GC → C be a k-homomorphism with pλ = 1GC . Let Bm be the subspace of A ⊗ GC generated by all elements a⊗x with |a| ≤ m. If the map ν : A → C, ν(a) = av, is monic for |a| ≤ m then the A-homomorphism η : A ⊗ GC → C, η(a ⊗ x) = a(λx) is monic on Bm . Furthermore, η is epic and thus is an isomorphism in dimensions ≤ m. Proof. This theorem is a version of the Milnor–Moore Theorem, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=126" target="_blank">Budyak 126</a>)</p>
6.30. Corollary (The Milnor–Moore Theorem). Let A and C be as in 6.29. If ν : A → C, ν(a) = av, is monic then there is an isomorphism of A-modules C∼ = A ⊗ GC. In particular, C is a free A-module (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">Budyak 127</a>)</p>
a canonical antiautomorphism c : A → A (called also an antipode) as follows (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">Budyak 128</a>)</p>
6.35. Deﬁnition. Given a connected Hopf algebra (A, μ, η, Δ, ε), we deﬁne a canonical antiautomorphism c : A → (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">Budyak 128</a>)</p>
Milnor–Moore [1]. The ﬁrst example of such an antiautomorphism was found by Thom [1]; this was the canonical antiautomorphism χ : Ap → Ap of the Steenrod algebra Ap .

Hopf [1] found that ordinary (co)homology rings of Lie groups (in fact, H-spaces) had certain speciﬁc algebraic properties. (For example, the rational cohomology ring of a Lie group is a free commutative algebra.) Afterwards Borel [1] clariﬁed the situation: every algebra A (over a ﬁeld) admitting a diagonal Δ : A → A ⊗ A, Δ(ab) = Δ(a)Δ(b), has such properties. Borel suggested the name “Hopf algebra” for such object; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=129" target="_blank">Budyak 129</a>)</p>
Milnor [2] discovered that the Steenrod algebra is a Hopf algebra. In this way he got a new description of Ap , and this enabled him (and some others) to compute initial terms of certain Adams spectral sequences.

Every graded abelian group G can be realized as the total homotopy group π∗ (H(G)) of the graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum H(G), but not every spectrum E is (equivalent to) the graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum H(π∗ (E)).

. (For example, the sphere spectrum S is not, because otherwise H∗ (HZ) would be a direct summand of H∗ (S).) It is clear that it is useful to know whether a spectrum is a graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum.

For example, Thom [2] proved that the spectrum M O of the non-oriented (co)bordism is a graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum, and this enabled him to compute the group π∗ (M O) (i.e., non-oriented cobordism group) and to prove the realizability of all Z/2-homology classes by singular manifold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">Budyak 130</a>)</p>
In this section we give some suﬃcient conditions for a spectrum E to be a graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum, i.e., E  H(π∗ (E) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">Budyak 130</a>)</p>
7.6. Corollary. Every HZ-module spectrum is a graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=132" target="_blank">Budyak 132</a>)</p>
7.9. Corollary. For every spectrum E, the spectrum HZ ∧ E is a graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum.

7.8. Corollary. If a ring spectrum E admits a ring morphism HZ → E then E is a graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum.

7.11. Theorem. (i) The Q -localization of the sphere spectrum S is HQ. In particular, the Hurewicz homomorphism h : π∗ (E) ⊗ Q → H∗ (E) ⊗ Q is an isomorphism for every spectrum E.

7.13. Theorem-Deﬁnition (cf. Dold [1]). For every ring spectrum E there exists a ring equivalence E[0] → H(π∗ (E) ⊗ Q). This equivalence is called the Chern–Dold character with respect to E and is denoted by chE .

7.14. Theorem. Let p be an odd prime, and let E be a Z[p]-local spectrum of ﬁnite Z[p]-type. If E ∧ M (Z/p) is a graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum then so is E.

7.16. Theorem. Let E be a spectrum of ﬁnite Z[p]-type. If H ∗ (E) is a free Ap -module then E is a graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum.

7.28. Corollary. If a commutative ring spectrum E is a graded Eilenberg– Mac Lane spectrum with pπ∗ (E) = 0, then there is an isomorphism H∗ (E) ∼ = A p∗ ⊗ π∗ (E) of Ap -comodule algebras.

7.30. Theorem (Boardman [1]). Let E, F be two commutative ring spectra. Suppose that E, F are graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectra with pπ∗ (E) = 0 = pπ∗ (F ). Then every ring homomorphism r : π∗ (E) → π∗ (F ) is induced by a ring morphism f : E → F . So, if there exists a ring isomorphism π ∗ (E) ∼ = ∼ = π∗ (F ) then there exists a ring equivalence E  F . In particular, there is a ring equivalence E  H(π∗ (E)).

A phantom, or a phantom map, is an essential map f : X → Y of a CW complex X such that f |X (n) is inessential for every n (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=143" target="_blank">Budyak 143</a>)</p>
1.1. Deﬁnition. A map f : X → Y of spaces (or a morphism of spectra) is called an X -phantom if σ[f ] = ∗ while [f ] = ∗. Similarly, an element a ∈ E ∗ (X) is an X -phantom if σ(a) = 0 while a = 0. This deﬁnition is given for an arbitrary family X , but really interesting are families with ∪Xα = X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=143" target="_blank">Budyak 143</a>)</p>

1.5. Example of a weak phantom. Let X = S n [1/3] be a Z[1/3]-localized sphere S n , n > 1, i.e., the telescope of a sequence f f f f Sn − → Sn − → ··· − → Sn − → ··· , where f : S n → S n is a map of degree 3. If we regard S n as a CW -complex with two cells, we obtain a cellular decomposition of X with 0-, nand (n+1)dimensional cells. This gives us a chain complex {C∗ (X), ∂∗ }, where Cn (X) has Z-basis {a1 , . . . , ai , . . . }, and Cn+1 (X) has Z-basis {b1 , . . . , bn , . . . }, and ∂ n+1 bi = ai − 3ai+1 . Let X = {Xλ } be the family of all ﬁnite CW n+1 subcomplexes of X. It is clear that HX (X) = H n+1 (S n ) = 0. On the other hand, H n+1 (X) = 0 because the cocycle ϕ : Cn+1 (X) → Z, ϕ(bi ) = 1 for every i, is not a coboundary. Indeed, if ϕ = δψ for some ψ : Cn (X) → Z, then ψ(ai ) − 3ψ(ai+1 ) = 1. In particular, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=144" target="_blank">Budyak 144</a>)</p>
ψ(a 1 ) = + 3k ψ(ak+1 ) 2 for every k. Hence, 3k divides 2ψ(a1 ) + 1 for every k, and so 2ψ(a1 ) = −1. This is a contradiction. Thus, the subgroup of weak phantoms of H n+1 (X) is nontrivial (and even uncountable, see 5.1 below).

1.6. Example of a phantom (Adams–Walker [1]). Let X = S 1 ∧ CP ∞ . Consider the space T = S 3 [0], the telescope of the sequence S 13 ϕ1 ϕ2 ϕn −→ S23 −→ · · · − → Sn3 −−→ Sn+1 3 − → ··· , where Sn3 is a copy of S 3 and deg ϕn = n.

Deﬁnition 1.4. A cellular map f : X → Y is a continuous function between CW-complexes so that f (Xq ) ⊂ Yq for all q. A cellular map induces a chain map f∗ : C∗ (X; R) → C∗ (Y ; R), since f restricts to a map of pairs f : (Xq , Xq−1 ) → (Yq , Yq−1 ). Thus for every q, cellular homology is a functor (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 20</a>)</p>
So for example, the circle S 1 has a cell structure with one 0-cell and one 1-cell. The boundary map is trivial, so H1 (S 1 ) ∼ = ∼ = Z. A generator [S 1 ] ∈ H1 (S ) is speciﬁed by taking the 1-cell which parameterizes the circle 1 in a counterclockwise fashion. We can use this to deﬁne the Hurewicz map ρ : π1 (X, x0 ) → H1 (X; Z) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 20</a>)</p>
Theorem 1.6. Suppose that X is path–connected. Then the Hurewicz map ρ : π1 (X, x0 ) → H1 (X; Z) is a surjection with kernel the commutator subgroup of π1 (X, x0 ). Hence H1 (X; Z) is isomorphic to the abelianization of π1 (X, x0 ).

1.1.4. Construction of the simplicial chain complex of a simplicial complex. Deﬁnition 1.7. An (abstract) simplicial complex K is a pair (V, S) where V is a set and S is a collection of non-empty ﬁnite subsets of V satisfying: 1. If v ∈ V then {v} ∈ S. 2. If τ ⊂ σ ∈ S and τ is non-empty, then τ ∈ S. Elements of V are called vertices. Elements of S are called simplices. A q-simplex is an element of S with q + 1 vertices. If σ ∈ S is a q-simplex we say dim (σ) = q.

Any element of A ⊗ B can be expressed as a ﬁnite sum uct  ai ⊗ bi , but it may not be possible to take n = 1, nor is the representation as a sum unique.

The universal property of the tensor product is that this map is initial in the category of bilinear maps with domain A × B.

Proposition 1.10. Given a R-bilinear map φ : A×B → M , there is unique R-module map φ̄ φ̄ : A ⊗R B → M so that φ̄ ◦ π = φ.

Proposition 1.10 is useful for deﬁning maps out of tensor products, and the following exercise indicates that this is the deﬁning property of tensor products. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 24</a>)</p>
. The basic properties of the tensor product are given by the next theorem. Theorem 1.11. 1. A ⊗ B ∼ = ∼ =B⊗A 2. R ⊗ B ∼ = ∼ =B 3. (A ⊗ B) ⊗ C ∼ = ∼ = A ⊗ (B ⊗ C) 4. (⊕α Aα ) ⊗ B ∼ = ∼ = ⊕ α (Aα ⊗ B) 5. Given R-module maps f : A → C and g : B → D, there is an Rmodule map f ⊗ g : A ⊗ B → C ⊗ D so that a ⊗ b → f (a) ⊗ g(b). 6. The functor − ⊗ M is right exact. That is, given an R-module M , and an exact sequence A f f − →B g g − → C → 0, the sequence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 24</a>)</p>
the sequence A ⊗ M f ⊗Id f ⊗Id −−−→ B ⊗ M g⊗Id g⊗Id −−−→ C ⊗ M → 0 is exact. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 24</a>)</p>
Example 1.12. Let M be an abelian group. Applying properties 5 and 2 of Theorem 1.11 we see that if we tensor the short exact sequence 0 → Z ×n ×n −−→ Z → Z/n → 0 by M we obtain the exact sequence M ×n ×n −−→ M → Z/n ⊗Z M → 0. Notice that Z/n ⊗Z M ∼ = ∼ = M/nM and that the sequence is not short exact if M has torsion whose order is not relatively prime to n. Thus − ⊗ M is not left exact.

1.2.2. Adjoint functors. Note that a R-bilinear map β : A × B → C is the same as an element of HomR (A, HomR (B, C)) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 25</a>)</p>
Proposition 1.14 (Adjoint Property of Tensor Products). There is an isomorphism of R-modules HomR (A ⊗R B, C) ∼ = ∼ = HomR (A, HomR (B, C)), natural in A, B, C given by φ ↔ (a → (b → φ(a ⊗ b))). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 26</a>)</p>
This is more elegant than the universal property for three reasons: It is a statement in terms of the category of R-modules, it gives a reason for the duality between tensor product and Hom, and it leads us to the notion of adjoint functor. Deﬁnition 1.15. (Covariant) functors F : C → D and G : D → C form an adjoint pair if there is a 1-1 correspondence MorD (F c, d) ←→ MorC (c, Gd), for all c ∈ Ob C and d ∈ Ob D, natural in c and d. The functor F is said to be the left adjoint of G and G is the right adjoint of F . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 26</a>)</p>
The adjoint property says that for any R-module B, the functors − ⊗ R B : R-MOD → R-MOD and HomR (B, −) : R-MOD → R-MOD form an adjoint pair. Here R-MOD is the category whose objects are Rmodules and whose morphisms are R-maps. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 26</a>)</p>
random functor may not have a left (or right) adjoint, but if it does, the adjoint is unique up to natural isomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 26</a>)</p>
Hence taking duals deﬁnes a contravariant functor from the category of R-modules to itself.

The following computational facts may help with Exercise 8. 1. HomR (R, M ) ∼ = ∼ = M. 2. HomR (⊕α Aα , M ) ∼ = ∼ = α HomR (Aα , M ). 3. HomR (A, α Mα ) ∼ = ∼ = α HomR (A, Mα ).

The starting observation is that the singular (or cellular) homology functor is a composite of two functors, the singular complex functor S∗ : { spaces, cts. maps } → { chain complexes, chain maps } and the homology functor H∗ :{chain complexes, chain maps}→{graded R-modules, homomorphisms}. The strategy is to place interesting algebraic constructions between S∗ and H∗ ; i.e. to use functors {Chain Complexes} → {Chain Complexes} to construct new homology invariants of spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=27" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 27</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 1.16. Taking the homology of C∗ ⊗ M yields the homology of C∗ with coeﬃcients in M : H∗ (C∗ ; M ) = ker ∂ : C∗ ⊗ M → C∗ ⊗ M Im ∂ : C∗ ⊗ M → C∗ ⊗ M . Applying this to the singular complex of a space leads to the following deﬁnition. Deﬁnition 1.17. The homology of S∗ (X; R) ⊗ M is called the singular homology of X with coeﬃcients in the R-module M and is denoted by H∗ (X; M ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 28</a>)</p>
Recall that for a chain complex (C∗ , ∂), a cycle is an element of ker ∂ and a boundary is an element of Im ∂. The terminology for cochain complexes is obtained by using the “co” preﬁx: Deﬁnition 1.20. A cocycle is an element in the kernel of δ and a coboundary is an element in the image of δ. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 29</a>)</p>
The Kronecker pairing on the homology and cohomology of a space should be thought of as an analogue (in fact it is a generalization) of integrating a diﬀerential n-form along an n-dimensional submanifold. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 30</a>)</p>
The map H n (C∗ ; R) → HomR (Hn (C∗ ; R), R) need not be injective nor surjective. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 30</a>)</p>
Suppose X is a smooth manifold. Let Ω q (X) be the vector space of diﬀerential q-forms on a manifold. Let d : Ω q (X) → Ωq+1 (X) be the exterior derivative. Then (Ω ∗ (X), d) is an R-cochain complex, whose cohomology is denoted by H ∗ DR (Ω ∗ (X), d) and is called the DeRham cohomology of X. This gives geometric analogues: q-form and q-cochain, d and δ, closed form and cocycle, exact form and coboundary. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 31</a>)</p>
DeRham’s theorem states that the DeRham cohomology of a manifold X is isomorphic to the singular cohomology H ∗ (X; R). More precisely, let Sqsmooth qsm (X; R) be the free R-module generated by smooth singular simplices σ : ∆ q → X. There is the chain map S ∗smooth (X; R) → S∗ (X; R) given by inclusion and the cochain map Ω (X) → S∗smooth (X; R) given by integrating a q-form along a q-chain. DeRham’s theorem follows from the fact that both maps are chain homotopy equivalences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 31</a>)</p>
1.4.1. Relative cohomology. Recall that the relative singular chain complex of a pair (X, A) is deﬁned by taking the chain groups Sq (X, A) = Sq (X)/Sq (A).

Lemma 1.24. Given a short exact sequence of R-modules 0 −→ A α α −→ B β β −→ C −→ 0, show that α splits if and only if β splits. (If either of these possibilities occur, we say the short exact sequence splits.) Show that in this case B ∼ = ∼ = A ⊕ C.

Deﬁnition 1.29. An (ordinary) cohomology theory is a contravariant functor H ∗ : { (space, subspace) pairs, continuous maps of pairs } → { graded R-modules, homomorphisms }.

for each pair (X, A) so that the sequence of Corollary 1.26 is exact. (Long exact sequence of a pair) 2. If f, g : (X, A) → (Y, B) are homotopic maps, then g ∗ = f ∗ : H q (Y, B) → H q (X, A). (Homotopy invariance) 3. If U ⊂ X, U ⊂ Int A, then H q (X, A) → H q (X − U, A − U ) is an isomorphism. (Excision) 4. If pt is a point, H q (pt) = 0 when q = 0.

1. There exist natural connecting homomorphisms δ : H q (A) → H q+1 (X, A) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=35" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 35</a>)</p>
Čech cohomology theory is another theory that satisﬁes the axioms (at least for the subcategory of pairs of compact spaces), but the Č Čech cohomology of the topologist’s sine curve is not isomorphic to the singular cohomology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=35" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 35</a>)</p>
. Thus the axioms do not determine the cohomology of space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=35" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 35</a>)</p>
cohomology. Thus the axioms do not determine the cohomology of space. However they do for ﬁnite CW-complexes. An informal way of saying this is that the proof that cellular cohomology equals singular cohomology uses only the axioms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=35" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 35</a>)</p>
Theorem 1.31 (Uniqueness). Let H ∗ and ̂ Ĥ ∗ be contravariant functors from the category {pairs of ﬁnite CW-complexes, cellular maps} to {graded R-modules, homomorphisms} satisfying the Eilenberg-Steenrod Axioms. Let pt be a point. 1. If H 0 (pt) ∼ = ∼ = ̂ Ĥ 0 (pt), then there is a natural isomorphism of functors H ∗ → Ĥ ∗ . 2. Any natural transformation H ∗ → Ĥ ∗ inducing an isomorphism for a point, is an isomorphism for all CW-complexes.

There are also many functors from spaces to R-modules for which the dimension axiom of Eilenberg and Steenrod does not hold. These are called generalized (co)homology theories.

1.6.1. Cellular approximation theorem. Recall that a cellular map f : X → Y is a map between CW-complexes which satisﬁes f (X n ) ⊂ Y n for all n. The cellular approximation theorem says that any map between CWcomplexes is homotopic to a cellular map (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=36" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 36</a>)</p>
We have already seen that the functors − ⊗R M , HomR (M, −), and HomR (−, M ) are not exact in general. For example taking R = Z, M = Z/2, and the short exact sequence 0 → Z ×2 ×2 −→ Z → Z/2 → 0, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 38</a>)</p>
Exercise 20. If F is a free module, show that − ⊗R F and HomR (F, −) are exact functors. Show by example that HomR (−, F ) need not be exact. The idea of homological algebra is to ﬁnd natural functors which measure the failure of a functor to preserve short exact sequences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=39" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 39</a>)</p>
(A ﬁrst stab at this for − ⊗R M might be to take the kernel of A ⊗ M → B ⊗ M as the value of this functor. Unfortunately, this does not behave nicely with respect to morphisms.)

Before we embark on the proof of this theorem, we prove that these axioms characterize the functors Tor and Ext. Theorem 2.3 (Uniqueness). Any two functors satisfying T1), T2), and T3) are naturally isomorphic. Any two functors satisfying E1), E2), and E3) are naturally isomorphic.

The technique of the above proof is called dimension shifting, and it can be useful for computations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=41" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 41</a>)</p>
Proposition 2.4. Let R be a commutative ring and a ∈ R a non-zerodivisor (i.e. ab = 0 implies b = 0). Let M be an R-module. Let M/a = M/aM and a M = {m ∈ M |am = 0}. Then 1. R/a ⊗ M ∼ = ∼ M/a, = 2. Tor1 (R/a, M ) ∼ = ∼ = aM , 3. Hom(R/a, M ) ∼ = ∼ = aM , 4. Ext 1 (R/a, M ) ∼ = ∼ = M/a.

Proposition 2.5. 1. If R is a ﬁeld, then Tor n R n (−, −) and ExtR n (−, −) are zero for n > 0. 2. If R is a P.I.D., then Tor n R n (−, −) and ExtR n (−, −) are zero for n > 1. Proof. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=42" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 42</a>)</p>
Corollary 2.7. The functors Tor R n (A, B) and Tor R n (B, A) are naturally isomorphic.

Tor and Ext are higher derived versions of ⊗R and Hom, so they have analogous properties. For example we oﬀer without proof: 1. Tor n R n (⊕α Aα , B) ∼ = ∼ = ⊕ α Tor n R n (Aα , B), 2. Extn R (⊕α Aα , B) ∼ = ∼ = α Extn R R (Aα , B), and 3. Ext n R (A, α Bα ) ∼ = ∼ = α Ext n R (A, Bα ).

Much of what we say can be done in the more general setting of abelian categories, these are categories where the concept of exact sequence makes sense (for example the category of sheaves or the category of representations of a Lie algebra) provided there are “enough projectives” or “enough injectives” in the category. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=43" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 43</a>)</p>
Recall, if F is a free module over R, A, B are R-modules, and F A ✲ B ✲ 0 α ❄ β ✲ α ✲ is a diagram with α onto, then there exists a γ : F → A so that F A ✲ B ✲ 0 α ❄ β ✠ γ ✲ α ✲ commutes. We say “the problem F A α✲ B ✲ 0 ❄ β p p p p p p✠p γ ✲ ✲ has a solution (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 44</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 2.8. An R-module P is called projective if for any A, B, α, β with α onto, the problem P A α✲ B ✲ 0 ❄ β p p p p p ✠ p✠p γ ✲ ✲ has a solution γ. Lemma 2.9. An R-module P is projective if and only if there exists an R-module Q so that P ⊕ Q is a free R-module (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 44</a>)</p>
Thus projective modules generalize free modules by isolating one of the main properties of free modules. Furthermore the deﬁnition of a projective module is purely in terms of arrows in R-MOD, and hence is more elegant than the deﬁnition of a free module. On the other hand they are less familiar. Exercise 22. Let P be a projective module. 1. Any short exact sequence 0 → A → B → P → 0 is split. 2. If P is ﬁnitely generated there is a ﬁnitely generated Q so that P ⊕ Q is free. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 45</a>)</p>
Proposition 2.10. 1. Any module over a ﬁeld is projective. 2. Any projective module over a P.I.D. is free (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 45</a>)</p>
Proof. All modules over a ﬁeld are free, hence projective. A projective module P is a submodule of the free module P ⊕ Q, and for P.I.D.’s submodules of free modules are free. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 46</a>)</p>
Note that R must be complicated, i.e. not a ﬁeld nor a P.I.D. For example, if R = Z/6, then P = Z/2 is a projective module. (To see this, use the Chinese remainder theorem Z/6 = Z/2 × Z/3). Here is a more interesting example, related to K-theory. Let R be the ring of continuous functions on the circle, R = C 0 (S 1 , R). Let E → S 1 be the twisted real line bundle over S 1 (so E = open Möbius band) Then as vector bundles E  = ∼ = S ∼ 1 × R, but E ⊕ E ∼ = ∼ = S 1 × R2 . So, if M = C 0 (E) (continuous sections of E), M is not free (why?), but M ⊕ M ∼ = ∼ = C 0 (S 1 , R) ⊕ C 0 (S 1 , R) = R ⊕ R. Thus M is projective.

One of the quantities measured by the functor K0 of algebraic K-theory is the diﬀerence between projective and free modules over a ring. See Chapter 11 for another aspect of algebraic K-theory, namely the geometric meaning of the functor K1 .

Corollary 2.11. For a projective module P , for n > 0, and for any module M , both Tor R n (P, M ) and Ext n R (P, M ) vanish.

Comment about Commutative Algebra. A Dedekind Domain is a commutative domain (no zero divisors) in which every module has a projective resolution of length 1. Equivalently submodules of projective modules are projective. A P.I.D. is a Dedekind domain (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=49" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 49</a>)</p>
submodules of projective modules are projective. A P.I.D. is a Dedekind domain. From the point of view of category theory, they are perhaps more natural than P.I.D.’s (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=49" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 49</a>)</p>
If ζn = e 2πi/n is a primitive n-th root of unity, then Z[ζn ] is a Dedekind domain. Projective modules (in fact ideals) which are not free ﬁrst arise at n = 23. Non-free ideals are what makes Fermat’s Last Theorem so hard to prove (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=49" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 49</a>)</p>
A commutative Noetherian ring R has height equal to n (ht(R) = n) if the longest chain of non-trivial prime ideals in R has length n: 0 ⊂ P1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Pn ⊂ R.

The homological dimension of R, hdim(R), is the least upper bound on the length of projective resolutions for all ﬁnitely generated modules over R. The homological dimension of a ﬁeld is 0 and a Dedekind domain is 1. If a ring has homological dimension n, then any module M has a projective resolution with Pk = 0 for k > n. The numbers ht(R) and hdim(R) are related. For a large class of rings (regular rings) they are equal.

Exercise 27. An R-module F is called ﬂat if − ⊗R F is exact. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 51</a>)</p>
free module is ﬂat and clearly a summand of a ﬂat module is ﬂat, so projectives are ﬂat. There are modules which are ﬂat, but not projective; show that Q is a ﬂat but not projective Z-module. In fact over a P.I.D. a module is ﬂat if and only if it is torsion free (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 51</a>)</p>
Tor can be computed using a ﬂat resolution rather than a projective one (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 51</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 2.21. A projective chain complex P∗ = {· · · → P2 → P1 → P0 } is a chain complex where all the modules Pi are projective. An acyclic chain complex C∗ = {· · · → C2 → C1 → C0 } is a chain complex where Hi (C∗ ) = 0 for all i > 0.

Theorem 2.22 (Fundamental lemma of homological algebra.). Let P∗ be a projective chain complex and C∗ be an acyclic chain complex over a ring R. Then given a homomorphism ϕ : H0 (P∗ ) → H0 (C∗ ), there is a chain map f∗ : P∗ → C∗ inducing ϕ on H0 . Furthermore, any two such chain maps are chain homotopic.

Corollary 2.23. Any two deleted projective resolutions of M are chain homotopy equivalent.

Lemma 2.26 (Horseshoe lemma). Let 0 → A → B → C → 0 be a short exact sequence of R-modules. Let PA and PC be deleted projective resolutions of A and C. Then there exists a deleted projective resolution PB of B, ﬁtting into a short exact sequence of chain complexes 0 → PA → PB → PC → 0 which induces the original sequence on H0 .

Theorem 2.29 (universal coeﬃcient theorem for cohomology). Let R be a principal ideal domain. Suppose that M is a module over R, and (C∗ , ∂) is a free chain complex over R (i.e. each Cq is a free R-module). Then the sequence 0 → ExtR (Hq−1 (C∗ ), M ) → H q (C∗ ; M ) → Hom(Hq (C∗ ), M ) → 0 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 59</a>)</p>
Proof of Theorem 2.29. There is a short exact sequence of graded, free R-modules 0 → Z∗ i i − → C∗ ∂ ∂ − → B∗ → 0 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 59</a>)</p>
where Zq denotes the q-cycles and Bq denotes the q-boundaries. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=60" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 60</a>)</p>
Applying the universal coeﬃcient theorem to the singular or cellular complexes of a space or a pair of spaces one obtains the following. Corollary 2.32. If (X, A) is a pair of spaces A ⊂ X, R a P.I.D., M a module over R, then for each q the sequence 0 → ExtR (Hq−1 (X, A; R), M ) → H q (X, A; M ) → Hom(Hq (X, A; R),M ) → 0 is short exact, natural, and splits (though the splitting is not natural). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=61" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 61</a>)</p>
Corollary 2.31. If R is a ﬁeld, M is a vector space over R, and C∗ is a chain complex over R, then H q (C∗ ; M ) ∼ ∼ = Hom(Hq (C∗ ), M ). Moreover the Kronecker pairing is non-degenerate (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=61" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 61</a>)</p>
Exercise 31. Let f : RP 2 → S 2 be the map pinching the 1-skeleton to a point. Compute the induced map on Z and Z/2 cohomology to show the splitting is not natural (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=61" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 61</a>)</p>
Then for space X whose homology is ﬁnitely generated in every dimension (e.g. a ﬁnite CW -complex), the universal coeﬃcient theorem shows that H q (X) ∼ = ∼ = free(Hq (X)) ⊕ torsion(Hq−1 (X)). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=61" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 61</a>)</p>
∗ = Hom(A, Z) and the torsion dual A  ∼ = ∼ = Hom(A, Q/Z), then the universal coeﬃcient theorem says that H q (X) ∼ = ∼ = Hq (X) ∗ ⊕ (torsion(Hq−1 (X))). The right hand side is then a contravariant functor in X but the isomorphism is still not natural. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=62" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 62</a>)</p>
Theorem 2.33. If R is a P.I.D., M is a ﬁnitely generated R-module, and C∗ is a free chain complex over R then there is a split short exact sequence 0 → H q (C∗ ) ⊗ M → H q (C∗ ; M ) → TorR 1 R 1 (H q+1 (C∗ ), M ) → 0. Notice the extra hypothesis that M be ﬁnitely generated in this statement. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=62" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 62</a>)</p>
The following universal coeﬃcient theorem measures the difference between ﬁrst tensoring a complex with a module M and then passing to homology versus ﬁrst passing to homology and then tensoring with M . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=62" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 62</a>)</p>
Theorem 2.34 (universal coeﬃcient theorem for homology). Suppose that R is a P.I.D., C∗ a free chain complex over R, and M a module over R. Then there is a natural short exact sequence. 0 → Hq (C∗ ) ⊗ M → Hq (C∗ ⊗ M ) → TorR 1 (Hq−1 (C∗ ), M ) → 0 which splits, but not naturally. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=62" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 62</a>)</p>
There is another universal coeﬃcient theorem for homology (see [36, pg. 248] for the proof). It addresses the question of how a diﬀerent version of the Kronecker pairing fails to pass to a perfect pairing on (co)homology. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=63" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 63</a>)</p>
Theorem 2.36. Let R be a P.I.D., C∗ a free chain complex over R such that Hq (C∗ ) is ﬁnitely generated for each q, and let M be an R-module. Then the sequence 0 → Ext1R 1R (H q+1 (C∗ ), M ) → Hq (C∗ ; M ) α α → Hom(H q (C∗ ), M ) → 0 is short exact, natural, and splits.

In particular if X is a compact smooth manifold, by the above corollary and DeRham cohomology we see the q-th Betti number is the dimension of the real vector space of closed q-forms modulo exact q-forms.

1. A graded R-module A∗ can be thought ofeither a collection of Rmodules {Ak }k∈Z , or as a module A = fe k Ak with a direct sum decomposition. 2. A homomorphism of graded R-modules is a element of k Hom(Ak , Bk ). 3. The tensor product of graded R-modules A∗ and B∗ is the graded R-module (A∗ ⊗ B∗ )n =  p+q=n (Ap ⊗ Bq ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=66" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 66</a>)</p>
The cellular chain complex C∗ (X × Y ) can be identiﬁed with (i.e. is isomorphic to) the tensor product C∗ (X) ⊗ C∗ (Y ).

Theorem 3.3 (Künneth exact sequence). Suppose C∗ , D∗ are chain complexes over a P.I.D. R, and suppose Cq is a free R-module for each q. Then there is a natural exact sequence 0 → ⊕ p+q=n Hp (C∗ )⊗Hq (D∗ ) × alg −−−→Hn (C∗ ⊗D∗ )→ ⊕ p+q=n Tor R (Hp (C∗ ), Hq−1 (D∗ ))→0 which splits (non-naturally). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=68" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 68</a>)</p>
The natural transformations A and B determine chain homotopy equivalences A : S∗ (X × Y ) → S∗ (X) ⊗ S∗ (Y ) and B : S∗ (X) ⊗ S∗ (Y ) → S∗ (X × Y ) for any pair of spaces X and Y . We will call these maps the Eilenberg-Zilber maps. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 70</a>)</p>
The confusing, abstract, but important point is that A and B are not canonical, but only natural. That is, they are obtained by the method of acyclic models, and so constructed step by step by making certain arbitrary choices. However, these choices are made consistently for all spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 70</a>)</p>
It is harder to imagine a candidate for the reverse map A : S∗ (X × Y ) → S∗ (X) ⊗ S∗ (Y ), but one can do this explicitly using projections to X and Y – the “Alexander-Whitney diagonal approximation”. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 70</a>)</p>
However, even if one constructs the maps A and B explicitly, they will only be chain homotopy equivalences, not isomorphisms; S∗ (X × Y ) is simply bigger than S∗ (X) ⊗ S∗ (Y ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 70</a>)</p>
3.3.1. The homology cross product and the Künneth formula. Exercise 32 implies that the natural map × alg : Hp X ⊗ Hq Y → Hp+q (S∗ X ⊗ S∗ Y ) given on the chain level by [a] ⊗ [b] → [a ⊗ b] is well-deﬁned. Denote by B∗ the isomorphism induced by the Eilenberg-Zilber map on homology, so B∗ : H∗ (S∗ (X) ⊗ S∗ (Y )) → H∗ (S∗ (X × Y )) = H∗ (X × Y ). Composing ×alg with B∗ , we obtain × : Hp X ⊗ Hq Y → Hp+q (X × Y ). Deﬁnition 3.5. If α ∈ Hp X, β ∈ Hq Y , the image of α ⊗ β under this map is called the homology cross product of α and β, and is denoted by α × β. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 71</a>)</p>
The Eilenberg-Zilber theorem has the following important consequence. Theorem 3.6 (Künneth formula). If R is a P.I.D., there exists a split exact sequence 0 → n ⊕ p=0 Hp X ⊗ Hn−p Y → Hn (X × Y ) → n−1 ⊕ p=0 Tor(Hp X, Hn−1−p Y ) → 0. The ﬁrst map is given by cross products. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 71</a>)</p>
Corollary 3.7. If R is a ﬁeld, then H∗ (X × Y ) = H∗ (X) ⊗ H∗ (Y ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 71</a>)</p>
The Künneth formula implies that if R is a P.I.D., α × β = 0 if α = 0 and β = 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 71</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 3.8. If a ∈ H p X, b ∈ H q Y , the image of a ⊗ b under the composite H p X ⊗ H q Y ×alg ×alg A −−−→ H p+q ((S∗ X ⊗ S∗ Y )∗ ) − ∗ A∗ −→ H ∗ (X × Y ) map is called the cohomology cross product of a and b, and is denoted by a × b. 3.3.3. The cup product. Combining the the diagonal map ∆ : X → X × X, x → (x, x) with the cross product leads to the important cup product: Deﬁnition 3.9. If If a ∈ H p X, b ∈ H q X, then the cup product of a and b is deﬁned by a ∪ b = ∆∗ (a × b) ∈ H p+q X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=72" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 72</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 3.11. A diagonal approximation τ is a chain map τ : S∗ X → S ∗ X ⊗ S ∗ X for every space X, so that 1. τ (σ) = σ ⊗ σ for every 0-simplex σ. 2. τ is natural with respect to continuous maps of a spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=74" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 74</a>)</p>
If A is an Eilenberg-Zilber map and ∆ : X → X × X is the diagonal map, then τ = A ◦ ∆∗ is a diagonal approximation. Thus we can rephrase the deﬁnition of the cup product a ∪ b = τ ∗ (a ×alg b). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=74" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 74</a>)</p>
3.3.4. The cap product. Recall that the Kronecker pairing is a natural bilinear evaluation map (sometimes called “integration” by analogy with the deRham map)  ,  : S ∗ X × S∗ X → R deﬁned for a ∈ S q X, z ∈ Sp X by a, z =  a(z) if p = q, 0 otherwise. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=77" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 77</a>)</p>
This pairing can be extended to a “partial evaluation” or “partial integration” map E : S ∗ X ⊗ S∗ X ⊗ S ∗ X → S ∗ X by “evaluating the ﬁrst factor on the last factor”, i.e. E(a ⊗ z ⊗ w) = a(w) ⊗ z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=77" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 77</a>)</p>
Exercise 37. Let a, b ∈ H ∗ X and z ∈ H∗ X. Show that 1. a, b ∩ z = a ∪ b, z. 2. a ∩ (b ∩ z) = (a ∪ b) ∩ z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 78</a>)</p>
Thus the cap product makes the homology H∗ (X) a module over the ring H ∗ (X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 78</a>)</p>
Corollary 3.16. The cap product descends to a well deﬁned product ∩ : H q X × Hp+q X → Hp X ([α], [z]) → [α ∩ z] after passing to (co)homology. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 78</a>)</p>
3.3.5. The slant product. We next introduce the slant product which bears the same relation to the cross product as the cap product does to the cup product (this could be on an SAT test). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 78</a>)</p>
Often one distinguishes between internal products which are deﬁned in terms of one space X (such as the cup and cap products) and external products which involve the product of two spaces X × Y . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=79" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 79</a>)</p>
It is nevertheless often useful to work on the chain level, since there is subtle homotopy-theoretic information contained in the singular complex which leads to extra structure such as such as Steenrod operations and Massey products. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=79" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 79</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 3.19. The Alexander-Whitney map A : S∗ (X × Y ) → S∗ (X) ⊗ S∗ (Y ) is the natural transformation given by the formula A(σ) =  p+q=n p (pX ◦ σ) ⊗ (pY ◦ σ)q .

Exercise 40. Using the Alexander-Whitney diagonal approximation, 1. prove that S ∗ (X; R) is an associative ring with unit 1 represented by the cochain c ∈ S 0 (X; R) = Hom(S0 (X); R) which takes the value 1 on every singular 0-simplex in X.

We have already seen that cohomology is an associative and graded commutative ring with unit in Theorem 3.13. However, the methods used there cannot be used to show that S ∗ (X) is an associative ring; in fact it is not for a random choice of Eilenberg-Zilber map A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 81</a>)</p>
The Alexander-Whitney map is a particularly nice choice of EilenbergZilber map because it does give an associative ring structure on S ∗ (X). This ring structure, alas, is not (graded) commutative (Steenrod squares give obstructions to its being commutative) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 81</a>)</p>
Notice that the deRham cochain complex of diﬀerential forms on a smooth manifold is graded commutative, since diﬀerential forms satisfy a ∧ b = ±b ∧ a. It is possible to give a natural construction of a commutative chain complex over the rationals which gives the rational homology of a space; this was done using rational diﬀerential forms on a simplicial complex by Sullivan. This fact is exploited in the subject of rational homotopy theory [14]. On the other hand it is impossible to construct a functor from spaces to commutative, associative chain complexes over Z which gives the integral homology of a space.

See Vick’s book [41] for a nice example of computing the cohomology ring of the torus directly using the Alexander-Whitney diagonal approximation.

The cup product of an q-dimensional cocycle with a q-dimensional cocycle generalizes the Kronecker pairing in the following sense. Proposition 3.21. For α ∈ H q X and z ∈ Hq X, α, z = <∗ (α ∩ z).

disappears when passing to cohomology. We now give a formal argument. We begin with some algebraic observations. Suppose (X, A) and (Y, B) are two pairs of spaces. Then S∗ X S∗ A ⊗ S∗ Y S∗ B ∼ = ∼ = S∗ X ⊗ S ∗ Y S∗ X ⊗ S ∗ B + S∗ A ⊗ S∗ Y .

Since a chain map between free chain complexes inducing an isomorphism on homology is a chain homotopy equivalence, this is equivalent to requiring that the inclusion map induces an isomorphism on homology. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 83</a>)</p>
Let V = H k (M ,Z)/T . So (V ,· ) is an inner product space over Z. This inner product space can have two kinds of symmetry. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 87</a>)</p>
If dim M = 2k, then H k (M ;Z)/T × H k (M ;Z)/T → Z called the intersection form of M . It is well-deﬁned and unimodular over Z, i.e. has determinant equal to ±1. Let V = H k (M ,Z)/T . So (V (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 87</a>)</p>
Case 1. k is odd. Thus dim M = 4F + 2. Then v · w = −w · v for v, w ∈ V , so (V ,· ) is a skew-symmetric and unimodular inner product space over Z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 87</a>)</p>
(V, · ) has matrix         0 1 −1 0 0 1 −1 0 . . .        (all other entries zero) in this basis. Such a basis is called a “symplectic basis”. The closed surface of genus r is an example; describe a symplectic basis geometrically (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 87</a>)</p>
basis geometrically. Hence unimodular skew-symmetric pairings over Z are classiﬁed by their rank. In other words, the integer intersection form of a 4k − 2-dimensional manifold M contains no more information than the dimension of H 2k+1 (M ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 87</a>)</p>
There are 3 invariants of such unimodular symmetric forms: 1. The rank of (V, · ) is the rank of V as a free abelian group. 2. The signature of (V, · ) is the diﬀerence of the number of positive eigenvalues and the number of negative eigenvalues in any matrix (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 87</a>)</p>
representation of (V, ·). (The eigenvalues of a symmetric real matrix are all real.)

Exercise 50. Show that although the eigenvalues of Q are not well deﬁned, their signs are well-deﬁned, so that the signature is well-deﬁned. (This is often called Sylvester’s Theorem of Inertia) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 88</a>)</p>
The type (odd or even) of (V, ·) is deﬁned to be even if and only if v · v is even for all v ∈ V . Otherwise the type is said to be odd. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 88</a>)</p>
The form (V, · ) is called deﬁnite if the absolute value of its signature equals its rank; i.e. the eigenvalues of Q are either all positive or all negative. The main result about unimodular integral forms is the following. For a proof see e.g. [29]. Theorem 3.27. If (V, · ), (W, · ) are two unimodular, symmetric, indeﬁnite forms over Z, then V and W are isometric (i.e. there exists an isomorphism V → W preserving the inner product) if and only if they have the same rank, signature, and type.

In fact, any odd indeﬁnite form is equivalent to ⊕  (1)⊕ m (−1), and any even indeﬁnite form is equivalent to (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 88</a>)</p>

The classiﬁcation of deﬁnite forms is not known. It is known that: 1. for each rank, there are ﬁnitely many isomorphism types. 2. If (V ,· ) is deﬁnite and even, then sign(V ,· ) ≡ 0 Mod 8.

Deﬁnition 3.28. The signature, sign M , of a compact, oriented 4k-manifold without boundary M is the signature of its intersection form H 2k (M ; Z)/T × H 2k (M ; Z)/T → Z The following sequence of exercises introduce the important technique of bordism in geometric topology.

We have seen that even–dimensional manifolds admit intersection forms on the free part of their middle dimensional cohomology. For odd-dimensional manifolds one can construct the linking form on the torsion part of the “middle dimensional” cohomology as well (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=89" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 89</a>)</p>

The zig-zag lemma gives a long exact sequence in cohomology δ i · · · → H q−1 (X; Q/Z) − → H q (X; Z) − → H q (X; Q) → · · · . Exercise 54.

(The map δ is a Bockstein homomorphism; see Section 10.4) The bilinear map Q/Z × Z → Q/Z, (a, b) → ab is non-degenerate, in fact induces an isomorphism Q/Z ⊗ Z → Q/Z.

metric if dim(M ) = 4k − 1.

Deﬁnition 4.1. A topological group G acts on a space X if there is a group homomorphism G → Homeo(X) such that the “adjoint” G×X →X (g, x) → g(x) is continuous. We will usually write g · x instead of g(x). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=92" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 92</a>)</p>
∈ X is the set Gx = {g · x|g ∈ G}. The orbit space or quotient space X/G is the quotient space X/ , with the equivalence relation x g · x. The ﬁxed set is X G = {x ∈ X|g · x = x for all g ∈ G}. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=92" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 92</a>)</p>
The orbit of a point x ∈ X is (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=92" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 92</a>)</p>
An action is called free if g(x) = x for all x ∈ X and for all g = e. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=92" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 92</a>)</p>
An action is called eﬀective if the homomorphism G → Homeo(X) is injective. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 93</a>)</p>
A variant of this deﬁnition requires the homomorphism G → Homeo(X) to be continuous with respect to the compact-open topology on Homeo(X), or some other topology, depending on what X is (for example, one could ∞ take the C ∞ topology on Diﬀ(X) if X is a smooth manifold). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 93</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 4.2. Let G be a topological group acting eﬀectively on a space F . A ﬁber bundle E over B with ﬁber F and structure group G is a map p : E → B together with a collection of homeomorphisms {ϕ : U × F → p −1 (U )} for open sets U in B (ϕ is called a chart over U ) such that (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 93</a>)</p>
In a ﬁber bundle, the map ψϕ,ϕ must have a very special form, namely 1. The homeomorphism ψϕ,ϕ (u, −) : F → F is not arbitrary, but is given by the action of an element of G, i.e. ψϕ,ϕ (u, f ) = g · f for some g ∈ G independent of f . The element g is denoted by θϕ,ϕ (u). 2. The topology of G is integrated into the structure by requiring that θ ϕ,ϕ  : U → G be continuous. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 94</a>)</p>
The requirement that G act eﬀectively on F implies that the functions θ ϕ,ϕ  : U → G are unique. Although we have included the requirement that G acts eﬀectively of F in the deﬁnition of a ﬁber bundle, there are certain circumstances when we will want to relax this condition, particularly when studying liftings of the structure group, for example, when studying local coeﬃcients. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 94</a>)</p>
It is not hard to see that a locally trivial bundle is the same thing as a ﬁber bundle with structure group Homeo(F ).

One subtlety about the topology is that the requirement that G be a topological group acting eﬀectively on F says only that the homomorphism G → Homeo(F ) is injective, but the inclusion G → Homeo(F ) need not be an embedding, nor even continuous. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=95" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 95</a>)</p>
This is a useful method of understanding bundles since it relates them to (Čech) cohomology. Cohomologous cochains deﬁne isomorphic bundles, and so equivalence classes of bundles over B with structure group G can be (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=95" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 95</a>)</p>

G need not be abelian (and so what does H 1 (B; G) mean? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=96" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 96</a>)</p>

4.3.2. Bundles over S 2 . For every integer n ≥ 0, we can construct an S 1 bundle over S 2 with structure group SO(2); n is called the Euler number of the bundle. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 97</a>)</p>
or n ≥ 1, deﬁne a 3-dimensional lens space L3n n = S 3 /Zn , where the action is given by letting the generator of Zn on act on S 3 ⊂ C2 by (z1 , z2 ) → (ζ n z 1 , ζn z2 ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 97</a>)</p>
Deﬁne the S 1 -bundle with Euler number n ≥ 1 by p : L3n 3n → S 2 = C ∪ ∞ by [z1 , z2 ] → z1 /z2 .

When n = 1 we obtain the famous Hopf bundle S 1 → S 3 → S 2 . For n > 1 the Hopf map S 3 → S 2 factors through the quotient map S 3 → L3n 3n , and the ﬁbers of the bundle with Euler number n are S 1 /Zn which is again homeomorphic to S 1 .

For n = 0, we have the product bundle p : S 2 × S 1 → S 2 . For n ≥ 1, deﬁne a 3-dimensional lens space L3n n = S 3 /Zn (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 97</a>)</p>
Show that the spaces S(T S 2 ), SO(3), and RP 3 are all homeomorphic (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 97</a>)</p>
4.3.3. Clutching. Suppose a topological group G acts on a space F . Let X be a space and let ΣX be the unreduced suspension of X, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 97</a>)</p>
Then given a map β : X → G, deﬁne (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 98</a>)</p>
This bundle is called the bundle over ΣX with clutching function β : X → G ⊂Aut(F ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 98</a>)</p>
Clutching provides a good way to describe ﬁber bundles over spheres. For X a CW-complex, all bundles over ΣX arise by this clutching construction. This follows from the fact that any ﬁber bundle over a contractible CW-complex is trivial (this can be proven using obstruction theory) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 98</a>)</p>
4.3.4. Local coeﬃcients and other structures. An important type of ﬁber bundle is the following. Let A be a group and G a subgroup of the automorphism group Aut(A). Then any ﬁber bundle E over B with ﬁber A and structure group G has the property that each ﬁber p−1 {b} has a group structure. This group is isomorphic to A, but the isomorphism is not canonical in general. We have already run across an important case of this, namely vector bundles, where A = Rn and G = GLn (R). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 98</a>)</p>
In particular, if A is a abelian group with the discrete topology, then p : E → B is a covering space and is called a system of local coeﬃcients on B. T (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 98</a>)</p>
The basic principle at play here is if the structure group preserves a certain structure on F , then every ﬁber p−1 {b} has this structure. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 98</a>)</p>
Principal bundles are special cases of ﬁber bundles, but nevertheless can be used to construct any ﬁber bundle. Conversely any ﬁber bundle determines a principal bundle. A principal bundle is technically simpler, since the ﬁber is just F = G with a canonical action. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 99</a>)</p>
Let G be a topological group. It acts on itself by left translation. G → Homeo(G), g → (x → gx). Deﬁnition 4.3. A principal G-bundle over B is a ﬁber bundle p : P → B with ﬁber F = G and structure group G acting by left translations. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 99</a>)</p>
Proposition 4.4. If p : P → B is a principal G-bundle, then G acts freely on P on the right with orbit space B.

As a familiar example, any regular covering space p : E → B is a principal G-bundle with G = π1 B/p∗ π1 E. Here G is given the discrete topology. In particular, the universal covering B̃ → B of a space is a principal π1 Bbundle. A non-regular covering space is not a principal G-bundle. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 100</a>)</p>
Exercise 63. Any free (right) action of a ﬁnite group G on a (Hausdorﬀ) space E gives a regular cover and hence a principal G-bundle E → E/G.

Theorem 4.5. Suppose that X is a compact Hausdorﬀ space, and G is a compact Lie group acting freely on X. Then the orbit map X → X/G is a principal G-bundle.

As an application note that if a topological group G acts on spaces F and F  , and if p : E → B is a ﬁber bundle with ﬁber F and structure group G, then one can use the transition functions from p to deﬁne a ﬁber bundle p  : E  → B with ﬁber F  and structure group G with exactly the same transition functions.  This is called changing the ﬁber from F to F  (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 100</a>)</p>
This can be useful because  the topology of E and E  may change (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 100</a>)</p>
With the second incarnation of the bundle the twisting becomes revealed in the homotopy type, because the total space of the ﬁrst bundle has the homotopy type of S 2 , while the total space of the second has the homotopy type of the sphere bundle S(T S 2 ) and hence of RP 3 according to Exercise 59.

We call this principal G-bundle the principal G-bundle underlying the ﬁber bundle p : E → B with structure group G.

 A fundamental case of changing ﬁbers occurs when one lets the ﬁber F be the group G itself, with the left translation action.

Deﬁnition 4.6. Let p : P → B be a principal G-bundle. Suppose G acts on the left on a space F , i.e. an action G × F → F is given. Deﬁne the Borel construction P ×G F to be the quotient space P × F/ ∼ where (x, f ) ∼ (xg, g −1 f ).

Thus principal bundles are more basic that ﬁber bundles, in the sense that the ﬁber and its G-action are explicit, namely G acting on itself by left translation. Moreover, any ﬁber bundle with structure group G is associated to a principal G-bundle by specifying an action of G on a space F . Many properties of bundles become more visible when stated in the context of principal bundles.

We say q : E ×G F → B is the ﬁber bundle associated to the principal bundle p : E → B via the action of G on F .

Recall that a local coeﬃcient system is a ﬁber bundle over B with ﬁber A and structure group G where A is a (discrete) abelian group and G acts via a homomorphism G → Aut(A) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=103" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 103</a>)</p>
Lemma 4.7. Every local coeﬃcient system over a path-connected (and semilocally simply connected) space B is of the form A ✲ B̃ ×π1 B A q q ❄ B i.e., is associated to the principal π1 B-bundle given by the universal cover B̃ of B where the action is given by a homomorphism π1 B → Aut(A).

In other words the group G ⊂ Aut(A) can be replaced by the discrete group π1 B.

In some circumstances, given a subgroup H of G and a ﬁber bundle p : E → B with structure group G, one can view the bundle as a ﬁber bundle with structure group H. When this is possible, we say the structure group can be reduced to H.

Proposition 4.8. Let H be a topological subgroup of the topological group G. Let H act on G by left translation. Let q : Q → B be a principal H-bundle. Then G ✲ Q ×H G q ❄ B is a principal G-bundle (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=104" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 104</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 4.9. Given a principal G-bundle p : E → B we say the structure group G can be reduced to H for some subgroup H ⊂ G if there exists a principal H-bundle Q → B and a commutative diagram Q ×H G r ✲ E ◗ ✑ ✑ ◗ ✑ s ◗ ✑ ✰ B so that the map r is G-equivariant. For a ﬁber bundle, we say the structure group reduces if the structure group of the underlying principal bundle reduces.

In this more general context, for example, Lemma 4.7 states that any ﬁber bundle over B with discrete ﬁber can have its structure group reduced to π1 B.

For example, a smooth manifold is orientable if and only if its tangent bundle is orientable (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=105" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 105</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 4.11. A morphism of ﬁber bundles with structure group G and ﬁber F from E → B to E  → B  is a pair of continuous maps f˜ : E → E  and f : B → B  so that the diagram f˜ f˜ E ✲ E E ❄ ❄ B ✲ B f f commutes and so that for each chart (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=105" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 105</a>)</p>
One important type of ﬁber bundle map is a gauge transformation. This is a bundle map from a bundle to itself which covers the identity map of the base, i.e. the following diagram commutes. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=106" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 106</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 4.12. Suppose that a ﬁber bundle p : E → B with ﬁber F and structure group G is given, and that f : B  → B is some continuous function. Deﬁne the pullback of p : E → B by f to be the space f ∗ (E) = {(b , e) ∈ B  × E | p(e) = f (b )}.

The following exercise shows that any map of ﬁber bundles is given by a pullback.

4.7.1. Fiber bundles over paracompact bases are ﬁbrations. State and prove the theorem of Hurewicz (Theorem 6.8) which says that a map f : E → B with B paracompact is a ﬁbration (see Deﬁnition 6.7) provided that B has an open cover {Ui } so that f : f −1 (Ui ) → Ui is a ﬁbration for each i. In particular, any locally trivial bundle over a paracompact space is a ﬁbration.

4.7.2. Classifying spaces. For any topological group G there is a space BG and a principal G-bundle EG → BG so that given any paracompact space B, the pullback construction induces a bijection between the set [B, BG] of homotopy classes of maps from B to BG and isomorphism classes of principal G-bundles over B (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=107" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 107</a>)</p>
Show that given any action of G on F , any ﬁber bundle E → B with structure group G and ﬁber F is isomorphic to the pullback f ∗ (EG ×G F ) where f : B → BG classiﬁes the principal G-bundle underlying E → B. Use this theorem to deﬁne characteristic classes for principal bundles (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=108" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 108</a>)</p>
When studying the homotopy theory of non-simply connected spaces, one is often led to consider an action of the fundamental group on some abelian group. Local coeﬃcient systems are a tool to organize this information. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=110" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 110</a>)</p>
There are two approaches to constructing the complexes giving the homology and cohomology of a space with local coeﬃcients. The ﬁrst is more algebraic, and takes the point of view that the fundamental chain complex associated to a space X is the singular (or cellular) complex of the universal cover X̃, viewed as a chain complex over the group ring Z[π1 X]. From this point of view local coeﬃcients are nothing more than modules over the group ring Z[π1 X].

The second approach is more topological; one takes a local coeﬃcient system over X (i.e. a ﬁber bundle over X whose ﬁbers are abelian groups and whose transition functions take values in the automorphisms of the group) and deﬁne a chain complex by taking the chains to be formal sums of singular simplices (or cells) such that the coeﬃcient of a simplex is an element in the ﬁber over that simplex (hence the terminology local coeﬃcients).

Deﬁnition 5.1. The group ring Zπ is a ring associated to a group π.

Let A be an abelian group and ρ : π → AutZ (A) be a homomorphism. (The standard terminology is to call either ρ or A a representation of π.)

sentation of a group π on an abelian group is the same thing as a Zπ-module.

Deﬁnition 5.2. If R is a ring (possibly non-commutative), M is a right R-module, and N is a left R-module (sometimes one writes MR and R N ), then the tensor product M ⊗R N is an abelian group satisfying the adjoint property Hom Z (M ⊗R N, A) ∼ = ∼ = HomR (M, HomZ (N, A)) for any abelian group A. The corresponding universal property is that there is a Z-bilinear map φ : (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=112" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 112</a>)</p>
The tensor product is constructed by taking the free abelian group on M × N and modding out by the expected relations. Elements of M ⊗R N are denoted by  m i ⊗ n i .

The starting point in the algebraic construction of homology with local coeﬃcients is the observation that the singular chain complex of the universal cover of a space is a right Zπ-module.

t since the ring Zπ is non-commutative (except if π is abelian), the tensored chain complex only has the structure of a chain complex over Z, not Zπ. Thus the homology group H∗ (X; A) is only a Z-module.

If the Zπ-module is speciﬁed by a representation ρ : π1 X →Aut(A) for some abelian group A, and we wish to emphasize the representation, we will sometimes embellish A with the subscript ρ and write H∗ (X; Aρ ) for the homology with coeﬃcients in A. It is also common to call H∗ (X; Aρ ) the homology of X twisted by ρ : π1 X →Aut(A).

If the module A is deﬁned by a representation ρ : π1 X →Aut(A) for an abelian group A, the cohomology with local coeﬃcients may be denoted by H ∗ (X; Aρ ) and is often called the cohomology of X twisted by ρ.

These examples and the two exercises show that the (untwisted) homology of any cover of X with any coeﬃcients can be obtained as a special case of the homology of X with appropriate local coeﬃcients.

One might ask whether the same facts hold for cohomology. They do not without some modiﬁcation. If A = Zπ, then the cochain complex HomZπ (S∗ X, A) is not in general isomorphic to X, HomZ (S∗ X, Z) and Z).

An important application of local coeﬃcients is its use in studying the algebraic topology of non-orientable manifolds.

For example, consider RP n for n even. The orientation double cover is S n ; the deck transformation reverses orientation.

Notice that Aut(Z) = {±1} and so the orientation character deﬁnes a representation w : π1 X → Aut(Z). The corresponding homology and cohomology Hk (X; Zw ), H k (X; Zw ) is called the homology and cohomology of X twisted by the orientation character w, or with local coeﬃcients in the orientation sheaf.

The Poincaré duality theorem (Theorem 3.26) has an extension to the non-orientable situation.

The cap products in Theorem 5.7 are induced by the bilinear maps on coeﬃcients Z × Zw → Zw and Zw × Zw → Z (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=117" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 117</a>)</p>
the local coeﬃcient system itself, i.e. the ﬁber bundle with discrete abelian group ﬁbers (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=118" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 118</a>)</p>
The homology of the chain complex (Sk (X; E), ∂) is called the homology with local coeﬃcients in E. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=119" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 119</a>)</p>
Here is the example involving orientability of manifolds, presented in terms of local coeﬃcients instead of the orientation representation. Let M be an n-dimensional manifold. Deﬁne a local coeﬃcient system E → M , by (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=119" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 119</a>)</p>
setting E= x∈M Hn (M, M − {x}). A basis for the topology of E is given by (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=120" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 120</a>)</p>
Then E → X is a local coeﬃcient system with ﬁbers Hn (M, M − {x}) ∼ = ∼ = Z, called the orientation sheaf of M . (Note the orientation double cover MO is the subset of E corresponding to the subset ±1 ∈ Z) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=120" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 120</a>)</p>
In particular, there is a Mayer-Vietoris sequence for homology with local coeﬃcients which gives a method for computing. Some care must be taken in using this theorem because local coeﬃcients do not always extend (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=122" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 122</a>)</p>
Given a homomorphism ρ : π1 (X − U ) → Aut(A) and an inclusion of pairs (X − U, B − U ) → (X, B) excision holds (i.e. the inclusion of pairs induces isomorphisms in homology with local coeﬃcients) only if ρ extends over π1 (X). In particular the morphism of local coeﬃcients must (exist and) be isomorphisms on ﬁbers. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=122" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 122</a>)</p>
Proposition 5.14. Let B be a path connected CW-complex, π = π1 (B) and V a Zπ-module. then 1. Let Vπ denote the quotient of V by the subgroup generated by the elements {v − γ · v | v ∈ V, γ ∈ π1 B } (the group Vπ is called the group of coinvariants). Then H0 (B; V ) ∼ = ∼ = Vπ .

2. Let V π π denote the subgroup of V consisting of elements ﬁxed by π, i.e. V π π = {v ∈ V | γ · v = v for all γ ∈ π} (the group V π is called the group of invariants). Then H 0 (B; V ) ∼ = ∼ = V π π .

5.5.1. The Hopf degree theorem. This theorem states that the degree of a map f : S n → S n determines its homotopy class. See Theorems 6.67 and 8.5. Prove the theorem using the simplicial approximation theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=123" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 123</a>)</p>
Colimits and limits are important categorical constructions in algebra and topology. Special cases include the notions of a cartesian product, a disjoint union, a pullback, a pushout, a quotient space X/A, and the topology of a CW-complex (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=124" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 124</a>)</p>
If all the Xi are subsets of a set A and if all the fi ’s are inclusions of subspaces show that the colimit can be taken to X = ∪Xi . The topology is given by saying U ⊂ X is open if and only if U ∩ Xi is open for all i. Thus such a colimit can be thought of as some sort of generalization of a union (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=124" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 124</a>)</p>
Consider the categories {· → · → · → · → · · · }, {· · · ← · ← · ← · ←}, {· → · ← ·}, {· ← · → ·}, {· ·}, and discuss how colimits and limits over these categories give the above colimit, the above limit, the pullback, the pushout, the cartesian product and the disjoint union.

Now let I be a category and let T be the category of topological spaces. Let X : I → T , i → Xi be a functor, so you are given a topological space for every object i, and the morphisms of I give oodles of maps between the Xi satisfying the same composition laws as the morphisms in I do. Deﬁne colim I Xi and lim I Xi (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=124" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 124</a>)</p>
Finally suppose that Y is a CW-complex and Y0 ⊂ Y1 ⊂ Y2 ⊂ Y3 ⊂ · · · is an increasing union of subcomplexes whose union is Y . Show that Hn Y = colim i→∞ Hn (Y i i ). Deﬁne Milnor’s lim 1 (see [25] or [42]) and show that there is an exact sequence 0 → lim ← 1 H n−1 (Yi ) → H n Y → lim ← H n (Yi ) → 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=125" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 125</a>)</p>
6.1. Compactly generated spaces Given a map f : X×Y → Z, we would like to topologize the set of continuous functions C(Y, Z) in such way that f is continuous if and only if the adjoint ˜ f˜ : X → C(Y, Z), f˜(x)(y) = f (x, y) is continuous (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=126" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 126</a>)</p>
continuous. Here are three examples: 1. We would like an action of a topological group G × Z → Z to correspond to a continuous function G → Homeo(Z), where Homeo(Z) is given the subspace topology inherited from C(Z, Z). 2. We would like a homotopy f : I × Y → Z to correspond to a path ˜ f˜ : I → C(Y, Z) of functions. 3. The evaluation map C(Y, Z) × Y → Z, (f, y) → f (y) should be continuous. (Is the evaluation map an adjoint?) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=126" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 126</a>)</p>
Unfortunately, such a topology on C(Y, Z) is not possible, even for Hausdorﬀ topological spaces, unless you bend your point of view (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=126" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 126</a>)</p>
The category of compactly generated spaces is a framework which permits one to make such constructions without worrying about these technical issues (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 127</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.1. A topological space X is said to be compactly generated if X is Hausdorﬀ and if a subset A ⊂ X is closed if and only if A ∩ C is closed for every compact C ⊂ X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 127</a>)</p>
3. CW-complexes with ﬁnitely many cells in each dimension. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 127</a>)</p>
Examples of compactly generated spaces include: 1. locally compact Hausdorﬀ spaces (e.g. manifolds), 2. metric spaces, and (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 127</a>)</p>
We will use the notation K for the category of compactly generated spaces. (This is taken as a full subcategory of the category of all topological spaces, i.e. every continuous function between compactly generated spaces is a morphism in K.) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 127</a>)</p>
Hausdorﬀ space can be turned into a compactly generated space by the following trick. Deﬁnition 6.2. If X is Hausdorﬀ, let k(X) be the set X with the new topology deﬁned by declaring a subset A ⊂ X to be closed in k(X) if and only if A ∩ C is closed in X for all C ⊂ X compact. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 127</a>)</p>
6.1.1. Basic facts about compactly generated spaces. 1. If X ∈ K, then k(X) = X. 2. If f : X → Y is a function, then k(f ) : k(X) → k(Y ) is continuous if and only if f |C : C → Y is continuous for each compact C ⊂ X. 3. Let C(X, Y ) denote the set of continuous functions from X to Y . Then k∗ : C(X, k(Y )) → C(X, Y ) is a bijection if X is in K. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 127</a>)</p>
4. The singular chain complexes of a Hausdorﬀ space Y and the space k(Y ) are the same. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 128</a>)</p>
6.1.2. Products in K. Unfortunately, the product of compactly generated spaces need not be compactly generated. However, this causes little concern, as we now see. Deﬁnition 6.3. Let X, Y be compactly generated spaces. The categorical product of X and Y is the space k(X × Y ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 128</a>)</p>
The following useful facts hold about the categorical product. 1. k(X × Y ) is in fact a product in the category K. 2. If X is locally compact and Y is compactly generated, then X × Y = k(X × Y ). In particular, I × Y = k(I × Y ). Thus the notion of homotopy is unchanged. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 128</a>)</p>
6.1.3. Function spaces. The standard way to topologize the set of functions C(X, Y ) is to use the compact-open topology. Deﬁnition 6.4. If X and Y are compactly generated spaces, let C(X, Y ) denote the set of continuous functions from X to Y , topologized with the compact-open topology. This topology has as a subbasis sets of the form U (K, W ) = {f ∈ C(X, Y )|f (K) ⊂ W } where K is a compact set in X and W an open set in Y . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 128</a>)</p>
If Y is a metric space, this is the notion, familiar from complex analysis, of uniform convergence on compact sets (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 128</a>)</p>
Unfortunately, even for compactly generated spaces X and Y , C(X, Y ) need not be compactly generated. We know how to handle this problem: deﬁne Map(X, Y ) = k(C(X, Y )). As a set, Map(X, Y ) is the set of continuous maps from X to Y , but its topology is slightly diﬀerent from the compact open topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 128</a>)</p>
Theorem 6.5 (adjoint theorem). For X, Y , and Z compactly generated, f (x, y) → f˜(x)(y) gives a homeomorphism Map((X × Y ), Z) → Map(X, Map(Y, Z)) Thus − × Y and Map(Y, −) are adjoint functors from K to K. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=129" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 129</a>)</p>
6.1.4. Quotient maps. We discuss yet another convenient property of compactly generated spaces. For topological spaces, one can give an example of quotient maps p : W → Y and q : X → Z so that p × q : W × X → Y × Z is not a quotient map. However, one can show the following. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=129" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 129</a>)</p>
The following useful properties of Map(X, Y ) hold. 1. Let e : Map(X, Y ) × X → Y be the evaluation e(f, x) = f (x). Then if X, Y ∈ K, e is continuous. 2. If X, Y, Z ∈ K, then: (a) Map(X, Y × Z) is homeomorphic to Map(X, Y ) × Map(X, Z), (b) Composition deﬁnes a continuous map Map(X, Y ) × Map(Y, Z) → Map(X, Z). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=129" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 129</a>)</p>
Theorem 6.6. 1. If p : W → Y and q : X → Z are quotient maps, and X and Z are locally compact Hausdorﬀ, then p × q is a quotient map. 2. If p : W → Y and q : X → Z are quotient maps and all space are compactly generated, then p × q is a quotient map, provided we use the categorical product. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=129" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 129</a>)</p>
By this convention, we lose no information concerning homology and homotopy, but we gain the adjoint theorem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=129" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 129</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.7. A continuous map p : E → B is a ﬁbration if it has the homotopy lifting property (HLP); i.e. the problem g̃ Y × {0} ✲ E Y ×I ✲ B G g̃ ✲ ❄p p ❄ p ✲ G p p p p pp p p p p pp p p p p p p p p✒ pp p pp ✒ ̃ G̃ has a solution for every space Y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 130</a>)</p>
In other words, given the continuous maps p, G, g̃, and the inclusion Y × {0} → Y × I, the problem is to ﬁnd a continuous map G̃ making the diagram commute. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 130</a>)</p>
A covering map is a ﬁbration. In studying covering space theory this fact is called the covering homotopy theorem. For covering maps the lifting is unique, but this is not true for an arbitrary ﬁbration. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 130</a>)</p>
The following theorem of Hurewicz says that if a map is locally a ﬁbration, then it is so globally. Theorem 6.8. Let p : E → B be a continuous map. Suppose that B is paracompact and suppose that there exists an open cover {Uα } of B so that p : p −1 (Uα ) → Uα is a ﬁbration for each Uα . Then p : E → B is a ﬁbration. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 130</a>)</p>
Corollary 6.9. If p : E → B is a ﬁber bundle over a paracompact space B, then p is a ﬁbration. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 130</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.11. If p : E → B is a ﬁbration, and f : X → B a continuous map, deﬁne the pullback of p : E → B by f to be the map f ∗ (E) → X where f ∗ (E) = {(x,e) ∈ X × E|f (x) = p(e)} ⊂ X × E and the map f ∗ (E) → B is the restriction of the projection X × E → X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=131" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 131</a>)</p>
A ﬁbration need not be a ﬁber bundle. Indeed, the deﬁnition of a ﬁbration is less rigid than that of a ﬁber bundle and it is not hard to alter a ﬁber bundle slightly to get a ﬁbration which is not locally trivial. Nevertheless, a ﬁbration has a well deﬁned ﬁber up to homotopy. The following theorem asserts this, and also states that a ﬁbration has a substitute for the structure group of a ﬁber bundle, namely the group of homotopy classes of self-homotopy equivalences of the ﬁber (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=131" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 131</a>)</p>
Theorem 6.12. Let p : E → B be a ﬁbration. Assume B is path connected. Then all ﬁbers Eb = p −1 (b) are homotopy equivalent. Moreover every path α : I → B deﬁnes a homotopy class α∗ of homotopy equivalences Eα(0) → Eα(1) which depends only on the homotopy class of α rel endpoints, in such a way that multiplication of paths corresponds to composition of homotopy equivalences. In particular, there exists a well-deﬁned group homomorphism [α] → (α −1 )∗ π1 (B, b0 ) → Homotopy classes of self-homotopy equivalences of Eb0 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=132" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 132</a>)</p>
Since homotopy equivalences induce isomorphisms in homology or cohomology, a ﬁbration with ﬁber F gives rise to local coeﬃcients systems whose ﬁber is the homology or cohomology of F , as the next corollary asserts. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 135</a>)</p>
Corollary 6.13. Let p : E → B be a ﬁbration and let F = p−1 (b0 ). Then p gives rise to local coeﬃcient systems over B with ﬁber Hn (F ; M ) or H n (F ; M ) for any n and any coeﬃcient group M . These local coeﬃcients are obtained from the representations via the composite homomorphism π1 (B,b0 ) →  Homotopy classes of self-homotopy equivalences F → F → Aut(A) where A = Hn (F ; M ) or A = H n (F ; M ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 135</a>)</p>
We see that a ﬁbration gives rise to many local coeﬃcient systems, by taking homology or cohomology of the ﬁber. More generally one obtains a local coeﬃcient system given any homotopy functor from spaces to abelian groups (or R-modules), such as the generalized homology theories which we introduce in Chapter 8.

Deﬁnition 6.14. Let (Y, y0 ) be a based space. The path space Py0 Y is the space of paths in Y starting at y0 , i.e. Py0 Y = Map(I,0; Y ,y0 ) ⊂ Map(I,Y ), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 135</a>)</p>
The loop space Ωy0 Y is the space of all loops in Y based at y0 , i.e. Ωy0 Y = Map(I,{0,1}; Y ,{y0 }). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=136" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 136</a>)</p>
Often the subscript y0 is omitted in the above notation. Let Y I I = Map(I, Y ). This is called the free path space. Let p : Y I I → Y be the evaluation at the end point of a path: p(α) = α(1). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=136" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 136</a>)</p>
1. The map p : Y I I → Y , where p(α) = α(1), is a ﬁbration. Its ﬁber over y0 is the space of paths which end at y0 , a space homeomorphic to Py0 Y . 2. The map p : Py0 Y → Y is a ﬁbration. Its ﬁber over y0 is the loop space Ωy0 Y . 3. The free path space Y I I is homotopy equivalent to Y . The projection p : Y I I → Y is a homotopy equivalence. 4. The space of paths in Y starting at y0 , Py0 Y , is contractible.

Given two ﬁbrations over B, p : E → B and p : E  → B, we say they have the same ﬁber homotopy type if there exists a map ˜ f˜ from E to E  covering the identity map of B, and a map g̃ from E  to E covering the identity map of B, such that the composites E ✲ E E  E  B B ❅ ❘ ❅ g̃◦f˜ ✲ ✠ ❅ ❘ ❅ ✲ ˜ f˜◦g̃ ✠ are each ﬁber homotopic to the identity via a homotopy which is the identity on (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=138" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 138</a>)</p>
Notice that a ﬁber homotopy equivalence f ˜ f˜ : E → E  induces a homotopy equivalence Eb0 → Eb 0 on ﬁbers.

Let f : X → Y be a continuous map. We will replace X by a homotopy equivalent space Pf and obtain a map Pf → Y which is a ﬁbration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=138" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 138</a>)</p>
Let q : Y I I → Y be the path space ﬁbration, with q(α) = α(0); evaluation at the starting point (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=138" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 138</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.17. The pullback Pf = f ∗ (Y I I ) of the path space ﬁbration along f is called the mapping path space. Pf = f ∗ (Y I I ) ✲ YI X ✲ Y f ✲ ❄ ❄ q ✲ f (6.1) An element of Pf is a pair (x, α) where α is a path in Y and x is a point in X which maps via f to the starting point of α.

The mapping path ﬁbration p : Pf → Y is obtaining by evaluating at the end point p(x, α) = α(1) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=139" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 139</a>)</p>
Given a map f : X → Y , it is common to be sloppy and say “F is the ﬁber of f ”, or “F → X → Y is a ﬁbration” to mean that after replacing X by the homotopy equivalent space Pf and the map f by the ﬁbration Pf → Y , the ﬁber is a space of the homotopy type of F . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=142" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 142</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.19. A map i : A → X is called a coﬁbration, or satisﬁes the homotopy extension property (HEP), if the following diagram has a solution (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=142" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 142</a>)</p>
Coﬁbration is a “dual” notion to ﬁbration, using the adjointness of the functors − × I and −I , and reversing the arrows. To see this, note that since a map A × I → B is the same as a map A → B I , the diagram deﬁning a ﬁbration f : X → Y can be written X ✛ eval. at 0 XI Z ✲ Y I. ❄ f ✛ eval. at 0 ✻ ✲ p p pp p p p p p pp p p p pp p pp The diagram deﬁning a coﬁbration f : Y → X can be written as (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=143" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 143</a>)</p>
For “reasonable” spaces, any coﬁbration i : A → X can be shown to be an embedding whose image is closed in X.

Deﬁnition 6.20. Let X be compactly generated, A ⊂ X a subspace. Then (X,A) is called an NDR–pair (NDR stands for “neighborhood deformation retract”) if there exist (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=143" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 143</a>)</p>
In particular the neighborhood U = {x ∈ X|u(x) < 1} of A deformation retracts to A.

Theorem 6.22 (Steenrod). Equivalent are: 1. (X,A) is an NDR pair. 2. (X × I, X × 0 ∪ A × I) is a DR pair. 3. X × 0 ∪ A × I is a retract of X × I. 4. i : A → X is a coﬁbration.

paracompact spaces are ﬁbrations. Theorem 6.23. If X is a CW-complex, and A ⊂ X a subcomplex, then (X,A) is a NDR pair (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=145" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 145</a>)</p>
The next result should remind you of the result that ﬁber bundles over (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=145" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 145</a>)</p>
Exercise 91. If (X, A) and (Y, B) are coﬁbrations, so is their product (X, A) × (Y, B) = (X × Y, X × B ∪ A × Y ). We next establish that a pushout of a coﬁbration is a coﬁbration; this is dual to the fact that pullback of a ﬁbration is a ﬁbration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=145" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 145</a>)</p>

Pushouts always exist. They are constructed as follows. When A is empty the pushout is the disjoint union B  C. A concrete realization is given by choosing base points b0 ∈ B and c0 ∈ C and setting BC = {(b, c0 , 0) ∈ B × C × I | b ∈ B} ∪ {(b0 , c, 1) ∈ B × C × I | c ∈ C}. In general, a concrete realization for the pushout of f : A → B and g : A → C is BC f (a) ∼ g(a) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=146" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 146</a>)</p>
Let f : A → X be a continuous map. We will replace X by a homotopy equivalent space Mf and obtain a map A → Mf which is a coﬁbration. In short, every map is equivalent to a coﬁbration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=146" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 146</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.26. The mapping cylinder of a map f : A → X is the space Mf = (A × I)  X (a, 1) ∼ f (a) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=146" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 146</a>)</p>
If f : A → X is a coﬁbration, then h is a homotopy equivalence rel A, in particular h induces a homotopy equivalence of the coﬁbers Cf → X/f (A).

Deﬁnition 6.28. A sequence of functions A f f − →B g g − →C of sets (not spaces or groups) with base points is called exact at B if f (A) = g −1 (c0 ) where c0 is the base point of C.

The following two theorems form the cornerstone of constructions of exact sequences in algebraic topology. Theorem 6.29 (basic property of ﬁbrations). Let p : E → B be a ﬁbration, with ﬁber F = p −1 (b0 ) and B path-connected. Let Y be any space. Then the sequence of sets [Y ,F ] i∗ i∗ −→ [Y ,E] p∗ p∗ −→ [Y ,B] is exact. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=150" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 150</a>)</p>
Theorem 6.30 (basic property of coﬁbrations). Let i : A → X be a coﬁbration, with coﬁber X/A. Let q : X → X/A denote the quotient map. Let Y be any path-connected space. Then the sequence of sets [X/A,Y ] q ∗ −→ [X,Y ] i ∗ i∗ −→ [A,Y ] is exact. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=150" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 150</a>)</p>
ﬁnition 6.31. Deﬁne K∗ to be the category of compactly generated spaces with a non-degenerate base point, i.e. (X,x0 ) is an object of K∗ if the inclusion {x0 } ⊂ X is a coﬁbration. The morphisms in K∗ are the base point preserving continuous maps. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=151" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 151</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.32. The smash product of based spaces is X ∧Y = X ×Y X ∨Y = X ×Y X × {y0 } ∪ {x0 } ∪ Y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=152" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 152</a>)</p>
Note that the smash product X∧Y is a based space. Contrary to popular belief, the smash product is not the product in the category K∗ , although the wedge product X ∨ Y = (X × {y0 }) ∪ ({x0 } × Y ) ⊂ X × Y is the sum in K∗ . The smash product is the adjoint of the based mapping space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=152" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 152</a>)</p>
Theorem 6.33 (adjoint theorem). There is a (natural) homeomorphism Map(X ∧ Y, Z)0 ∼ = ∼ = Map(X, Map(Y, Z)0 )0 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=152" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 152</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.34. The (reduced) suspension of a based space (X, x0 ) is SX = S 1 ∧ X. The (reduced) cone is CX = I ∧ X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=152" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 152</a>)</p>
In other words, if ΣX is the unreduced suspension and cone(X) is the unreduced cone (= ΣX/X × {0}), then there are quotient maps ΣX → SX cone(X) → CX given by identifying {x0 } × I shaded in the following ﬁgure. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=152" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 152</a>)</p>
Exercise 94. If X ∈ K∗ (i.e. the inclusion {x0 } → X is a coﬁbration), then the quotient maps ΣX → SX and cone(X) → CX are homotopy equivalences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=153" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 153</a>)</p>
Proposition 6.35. The reduced suspension SS n is homeomorphic to S n+1 and the reduced cone CS n is homeomorphic to D n+1 .

Theorem 6.37 (loops and suspension are adjoints). The spaces Map(SX, Y )0 and Map(X, ΩY )0 are naturally homeomorphic (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=153" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 153</a>)</p>
We will see eventually that the homotopy type of a ﬁber of a ﬁbration measures how far the ﬁbration is from being a homotopy equivalence. (For example, if the ﬁber is contractible then the ﬁbration is a homotopy equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=154" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 154</a>)</p>
) More generally given a map f : X → Y , one can turn it into a ﬁbration Pf → Y as above; the ﬁber of this ﬁbration measures how far f is from a homotopy equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=154" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 154</a>)</p>
After turning f : X → Y into a ﬁbration Pf → Y one then has an inclusion of the ﬁber F ⊂ Pf . Why not turn this into a ﬁbration and see what happens? Now take the ﬁber of the resulting ﬁbration and continue the process . . .

Deﬁnition 6.38. If f : X → Y is a map, the homotopy ﬁber of f is the ﬁber of the ﬁbration obtained by turning f into a ﬁbrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=154" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 154</a>)</p>
Similarly, the homotopy coﬁber of f : X → Y is the mapping cone Cf , the coﬁber of X → Mf .

. Let F → E → B be a ﬁbration. Let Z be the homotopy ﬁber of F → E, so Z → F → E is a ﬁbration (up to homotopy). Then Z is homotopy equivalent to the loop space ΩB.

. Let A → X → X/A be a coﬁbration sequence. Let W be the homotopy coﬁber of X → X/A, so that X → X/A → W is a coﬁbration (up to homotopy).

1  . Let A → X be a base point preserving coﬁbration. Then any two consecutive maps in the sequence A → X → X/A → SA → SX → · · · → S n A → S n X → S n (X/A) → · · · have the homotopy type of a coﬁbration followed by projection onto the coﬁber. 2.

[X,Ω(ΩY )]0 = [SX, ΩY ]0 = [S 2 X, Y ]0 is an abelian group. Sketch of proof. The equalities follow from Theorem 6.37, the adjointness of loops and suspension.

A loop space is a example of an H-group and a suspension is an example of a co-H-group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=158" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 158</a>)</p>
, but here is the basic idea. An H-group Z is a based space with a “multiplication” map µ : Z × Z → Z and an “inversion” map ϕ : X → X which satisfy the axioms of a group up to homotopy (e.g. is associative up to homotopy). For a topological group G and any space X, Map(X, G) is a group, similarly for an H-group Z, [X, Z]0 is a group. To deﬁne a co-H-group, one reverses all the arrows in the deﬁnition of H- (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=158" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 158</a>)</p>
group, so there is a co-multiplication ν : W → W ∨ W and a co-inversion (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=158" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 158</a>)</p>
ψ : W → W . Then [W, X]0 is a group. Finally, there is a formal, but occasionally very useful result. If W is a co-H-group and Z is an H-group, then the two multiplications on [W, Z]0 agree and are abelian. Nifty, huh? One consequence of this is that π1 (X, x0 ) of an H-group (e.g. a topological group) is abelian (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=159" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 159</a>)</p>
Theorem 6.42 (Puppe sequences). Let Y ∈ K∗ . 1.

2. If (X,A) is an coﬁbration, the following sequence is a long exact sequence of sets (i ≥ 0), groups (i ≥ 1), and abelian groups (i ≥ 2). · · · → [S i (X/A), Y ]0 → [S i X, Y ]0 → [S i A, Y ]0 → · · · → [SA, Y ]0 → [X/A, Y ]0 → [X, Y ]0 → [A, Y ]0 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=159" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 159</a>)</p>
In particular, πn X = π1 (Ω n−1 X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=159" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 159</a>)</p>
For example, to get a hold of the group structure for writing down a proof, use πn (X, x0 ) = [(I n , ∂I n ), (X, x0 )]. For the proof of the exact sequence of a pair (coming later) use πn (X, x0 ) = [(D n , S n−1 ), (X, x0 )]. For ﬁnding a geometric interpretation of the boundary map in the homotopy long exact sequence of a ﬁbration given below, use πn (X, x0 ) = [(S n−1 × I, (S n−1 × ∂I) ∪ (∗ × I)), (X, x0 )].

Finally, the homotopy type of a CWcomplex X is determined by the homotopy groups of X together with a cohomological recipe (the k-invariants) for assembling these groups.

Exercise 100. GK is a compact Lie group homeomorphic to S r for r = 0, 1, 3.

Returning to the other exact sequences, it follows from the cellular approximation theorem that πn S 4 = πn−1 S 3 for n ≤ 6 (since πn (S 7 ) = 0 for n ≤ 6), and that πn S 8 = πn−1 S 7 for n ≤ 14.

The Stiefel manifold Vk (R n ) is the space of orthonormal k-frames in R n : Vk (R n ) = {(v1 , v2 , . . . , vk ) ∈ (Rn )k | vi · vj = δij } given the topology as a subspace of (R n ) k = R nk .

The Grassmann manifold or grassmannian Gk (R n ) is the space of kdimensional subspaces (a.k.a. k-planes) in R n . It is given the quotient topology using the surjection Vk (R n ) → Gk (Rn ) taking a k-frame to the k-plane it spans.

Let G be a compact Lie group. Let H ⊂ G be a closed subgroup (and hence a Lie group itself). The quotient G/H is called a homogeneous space. The (group) quotient map G → G/H is a principal H-bundle since H acts freely on G by right translation. If H has a closed subgroup K, then H acts on the homogeneous space H/K. Changing the ﬁber of the above bundle results in a ﬁber bundle G/K → G/H with ﬁber H/K.

Let γk (R n ) = {(p, V ) ∈ Rn × Gk (Rn ) | p is a point in the k-plane V }. There is a natural map γk (R n ) → Gk (Rn ) given by projection on the second coordinate.

πi (O(n − 1)) ∼ = (6.3) πi (O(n − 1)) ∼ = πi (O(n)) for i < n − 2, and πi (Vk (R n )) = 0 for i < n − k − 1.

clutching (see Section 4.3.3) corresponds to a bundle over S k+1 with structure group O(n). (Alternatively, one may use that πk+1 (BO(n)) ∼ = ∼ = πk (O(n)) using the long exact sequence of homotopy groups of the ﬁbration O(n) → EO(n) → BO(n)).

is a principal G-bundle EG → BG where EG is contractible. This bundle classiﬁes principal G-bundles in the sense that given a principal G-bundle p : G → E → B over a CW-complex B (or more generally a paracompact space), there is a map of principal G-bundles E ✲ EG B ✲ BG f ❄ p ✲ ˜ f˜ ❄ ✲ f and that the homotopy class [f ] ∈ [B, BG] is uniquely determined. It follows that the (weak) homotopy type of BG is uniquely determined (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=166" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 166</a>)</p>
A project for Chapter 4 was to show that for every topological group G, there (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=166" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 166</a>)</p>
Corollary 6.50. The inﬁnite grassmannian Gk (R ∞ ) is a model for BO(k). The principal O(k) bundle O(k) → Vk (R ∞ ) → Gk (R ∞ ) is universal and classiﬁes principal O(k)-bundles. The canonical bundle R k → γk (R ∞ ) → Gk (R ∞ ) classiﬁes R k -vector bundles with structure group O(k) (i.e. R k -vector bundles equipped with metric on each ﬁber which varies continuously from ﬁber to ﬁber). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=166" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 166</a>)</p>
The fact that the grassmannian classiﬁes orthogonal vector bundles makes sense from a geometric point of view.

Moreover, Gk (R ∞ ) is also a model for BGLk (R) and hence is a classifying space for k-plane bundles over CW-complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=167" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 167</a>)</p>
This follows either by redoing the above discussion, replacing k-frames by sets of k-linearly independent vectors, or by using the fact that O(k) → GLk (R) is a homotopy equivalence, with the homotopy inverse map being given by the Gram-Schmidt process.

Similar statements apply in the complex setting to unitary groups U (n). Let Gk (C n ) = complex k-planes in C n Gk (C n ) = U (n)/(U (k) × U (n − k)), the complex grassmanian Vk (C n ) = U (n)/U (n − k), the unitary Stiefel manifold.

Moreover, V1 (C n ) ∼ = ∼ = S 2n−1 , therefore πk (U (n)) ∼ = ∼ = πk (U (n − 1)) if k < 2n − 2 and so letting U = lim n→∞ U (n), we conclude that πk U = πk (U (n)) for n > 1 + k 2 .

Taking determinants give ﬁbrations SO(n) → O(n) det det −−→ {±1} and SU (n) → U (n) det det −−→ S 1 . In particular, SO(n) is the identity path–component of O(n), so πk (SO(n)) = πk (O(n)) for k ≥ 1.

This is a functor from pairs of spaces to sets (n = 1), groups (n = 2), and abelian groups (n > 2).

Notice that the commutativity of this diagram and the fact that f∗ is an isomorphism gives an alternative deﬁnition of the connecting homomorphism πk (B) → πk−1 (F ) in the long exact sequence of the ﬁbration F → E → B.

Homotopy groups are harder to compute and deal with than homology groups, essentially because excision fails for relative homotopy groups. In Chapter 8 we will discuss stable homotopy and generalized homology theories, in which (properly interpreted) excision does hold. Stabilization is a procedure which looks at a space X only in terms of what homotopy information remains in S n X as n gets large. The ﬁber L(X, A) and coﬁber X/A are stably homotopy equivalent.

Theorem 6.57. This deﬁnes an action of π1 (Y, y0 ) on the based set [X, Y ]0 , and [X, Y ] is the quotient set of [X, Y ]0 by this action if Y is path connected.

Now π1 (Y, y0 ) can be identiﬁed with group of covering transformations of ̃ Ỹ . Thus, π1 (Y, y0 ) acts on [X, Y ̃ Ỹ ] by post composition i.e. α : ̃ Ỹ → Ỹ acts on f : X → Ỹ by α ◦ f .

One could restrict to simply connected spaces Y and never worry about the distinction between based and unbased homotopy classes of maps into Y . This is not practical in general, and so instead one can make a dimensionby-dimension deﬁnition. Deﬁnition 6.61. We say Y is n-simple if π1 Y acts trivially on πn Y .

Theorem 6.66 (Hurewicz theorem). 1. Let n > 0. Suppose that X is path-connected. If πk (X, x0 ) = 0 for all k < n, then Hk (X) = 0 for all 0 < k < n, and the Hurewicz map ρ : πn X → H n X is an isomorphism if n > 1, and a surjection with kernel the commutator subgroup of π1 X if n = 1.

2. Let n > 1. Suppose X and A are path-connected. If πk (X, A) = 0 for all k < n then Hk (X, A) = 0 for all k < n, and ρ : π + n+ (X, A) → Hn (X, A) is an isomorphism. In particular ρ : πn (X, A) → Hn (X, A) is an epimorphism.

Corollary 6.67 (Hopf degree theorem). The Hurewicz map ρ : πn S n → Hn S n is an isomorphism. Hence a degree zero map f : S n → S n is nullhomotopic.

Although we have stated this as a corollary of the Hurewicz theorem, it can be proven directly using only the (easy) simplicial approximation theorem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=177" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 177</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.68. 1. A space X is called n-connected if πk X = 0 for k ≤ n. (Thus “simply connected” is synonymous with 1-connected). 2. A pair (X, A) is called n-connected if πk (X, A) = 0 for k ≤ n. 3. A map f : X → Y is called n-connected if the pair (Mf , X) is nconnected, where Mf = mapping cylinder of f .

Using the long exact sequence for (Mf , X) and the homotopy equivalence Mf ∼ Y we see that f is n-connected if and only if f∗ : πk X → πk Y is an isomorphism for k < n and an epimorphism for k = n. Replacing the map f : X → Y by a ﬁbration and using the long exact sequence for the (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=177" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 177</a>)</p>
homotopy groups of a ﬁbration shows that f is n-connected if and only if the homotopy ﬁber of f is (n − 1)-connected. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
Corollary 6.69 (Whitehead theorem). 1. If f : X → Y is n-connected, then f∗ : Hq X → Hq Y is an isomorphism for all q < n and an epimorphism for q = n. 2. If X, Y are 1-connected, and f : X → Y is a map such that f∗ : Hq X → Hq Y is an isomorphism for all q < n and an epimorphism for q = n. Then f is n-connected. 3. If X, Y are 1-connected spaces, f : X → Y a map inducing an isomorphism on Z-homology, then f induces isomorphisms f∗ : πk X ∼ = ∼ = = − → πk Y for all k. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
A map f : X → Y inducing an isomorphism of πk X → πk Y for all k is called a weak homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
Thus a map inducing a homology isomorphism between simply connected spaces is a weak homotopy equivalence. Conversely a weak homotopy equivalence between two spaces gives a homology isomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
We will see later (Theorem 7.34) that if X, Y are CW-complexes, then f : X → Y is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if f is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
Corollary 6.70. A continuous map f : X → Y between simply connected CW-complexes inducing an isomorphism on all Z-homology groups is a homotopy equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
This corollary does not imply that if X, Y are two simply connected spaces with the same homology, then they are homotopy equivalent; one needs a map inducing the homology equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
For example, X = S 4 ∨ (S 2 × S 2 ) and Y = CP 2 ∨ CP 2 are simply connected spaces with the same homology. They are not homotopy equivalent because their cohomology rings are diﬀerent.

Recall from Shapiro’s lemma (Exercise 75) that Hk (X ̃ X̃; Z) ∼ = ∼ = Hk (X, Z[π1 X]) for all k (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
The Whitehead theorem for non-simply connected spaces involves homology with local coeﬃcients: If f : X → Y is a map, let f˜ : X̃ → Ỹ be the corresponding lift to universal covers. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
and πk ̃ X̃ ∼ = ∼ = πk X for k > 1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=179" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 179</a>)</p>
Theorem 6.71. If f : X → Y induces an isomorphism f∗ : π1 X → π1 Y , then f is n-connected if and only if it induces isomorphisms Hk (X; Z[π]) → Hk (Y ; Z[π]) for k < n and an epimorphism Hn (X; Z[π]) → Hn (Y ; Z[π]) In particular, f is a weak homotopy equivalence (homotopy equivalence if X, Y are CW-complexes) if only if f∗ : Hk (X; Aρ ) → Hk (Y ; Aρ ) is an isomorphism for all local coeﬃcient systems ρ : π → Aut(A). Thus, in the presence of a map f : X → Y , homotopy equivalences can be detected by homology.

6.18.1. The Hurewicz theorem. The statement is given in Theorem 6.66. A reference is §IV.4-IV.7 in [43]. Another possibility is to give a spectral sequence proof. Chapter 10 contains a spectral sequence proof the Hurewicz theorem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=179" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 179</a>)</p>
Obstruction theory addresses the following types of problems (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=180" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 180</a>)</p>
Fibrations and coﬁbrations are easier to work with than arbitrary maps since they have ﬁbers and coﬁbers (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=181" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 181</a>)</p>
Then the following exercise is an easy consequence of the homotopy lifting property, the homotopy extension property, and the method of turning maps into ﬁbrations or coﬁbrations. Exercise 116. Each of the four problems stated above is solvable for arbitrary continuous maps g : A → X and p : E → B between CW-complexes if and only if it is solvable for the CW-pair (Mh , A) and the ﬁbration Pp → E. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=182" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 182</a>)</p>
Exercise 117. (Motivating exercise of obstruction theory) Any map f : X → Y from an n-dimensional CW-complex to an n-connected space is null-homotopic. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=182" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 182</a>)</p>
It turns out that if Y is only assumed to be (n − 1)-connected there is a single obstruction θ(f ) ∈ H n (X; πn Y ) which vanishes if and only if the map f is null-homotopic. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=182" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 182</a>)</p>
In this way we obtain a cellular cochain which assigns to e n+1 ∈ X the element in πn Y . If this cochain is the zero cochain, then the map can be extended over the (n + 1)-skeleton of X. It turns out this cochain is in fact a cocycle and so represents a cohomology class in H n+1 (X; πn Y ). The remarkable result is that if this cocycle represents the zero cohomology class, then by redeﬁning the map on the n-skeleton one can then extend it over the (n + 1)-skeleton of X (if you take one step backwards, then you will be able to take two steps forward).

This suggests one could deﬁne H n (X; A) to be [X, K(A, n)]. This observation forms the basic link between the homological algebra approach to cohomology and homotopy theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=183" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 183</a>)</p><hr># (Graduate Texts in Mathematics 267) Brian C.

I was immediately intrigued by this surprising connection between homological algebra and geometry (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=3" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 3</a>)</p>
If you play around with some simple examples, an idea for defining intersection multiplicities comes up naturally. It is i(Z, W ; P ) = dim C h C [x1 , . . . , xn ]/(f1 , . . . , fk , g1 , . . . , gl ) i P (1.1) i(Z, W ; P ) = dimC C[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(f1 , . . . , fk , g1 , . . . , gl ) . Here the subscript P indicates localization of the given ring at the maximal ideal (x1 − p1 , . . . , xn − pn ) where P = (p1 , . . . , pn ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=5" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 5</a>)</p>
Example 1.2. Let f = y − x2 and g = y. This is our example of the parabola and the tangent line at its vertex. The point P = (0, 0) is the only intersection point, and our definition tells us to look at the ring C [x, y]/(y − x 2 , y) ∼ = ∼ = C[x]/(x 2 ). As a vector space over C this is two-dimensional, with basis 1 and x. So our definition gives i(Z, W ; P ) = 2 as desired. [Note that technically we should localize at the ideal (x, y), which corresponds to localization at (x) in C [x]/(x 2 ); however, this ring is already local and so the localization has no effect] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=5" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 5</a>)</p>
Note the appearance of (x − 1) with multiplicity two in the above factorization. The fact that we had a tangent line at x = 1 guaranteed that the multiplicity would be strictly larger than one (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 6</a>)</p>
Serre discovered the correct formula for the interesection multiplicity [S]. His formula is as follows. If we set R = C [x1 , . . . , xn ] then i(Z, W ; P ) = ∞ X j=0 (−1) j dim h Tor R j  R/(f1 , . . . , fk ), R/(g1 , . . . , g l ) i P .

An algebraist who looks at (1.5) will immediately notice some possible generalizations. The R/(f ) and R/(g) terms can be replaced by any finitely-generated module M and N , as long as the Torj (M, N ) modules are finite-dimensional over C . For this it turns out to be enough that M ⊗R N be finite-dimensional over C . Also, we can replace C [x1 , . . . , xn ] with any ring having the property that all finitely-generated modules have finite projective dimension—necessary so that the alternating sum of (1.5) is finite. Such rings are called regular. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=7" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 7</a>)</p>
Let R be a regular, local ring (all rings are assumed to be commutative and Noetherian unless otherwise noted). Let M and N be finitely-generated modules over R such that M ⊗R N has finite length. This implies that all the Torj (M, N ) modules also have finite length. Define e(M, N ) = ∞ X j=0 (−1) j X (−1)j ` Torj (M, N )  (1.6) e(M, N ) = and call this the intersection multiplicty of the modules M and N . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 8</a>)</p>
Based on geometric intuition, Serre made the following conjectures about the above situation: (1) dim M + dim N ≤ dim R always (2) e(M, N ) ≥ 0 always (3) If dim M + dim N < dim R then e(M, N ) = 0. (4) If dim M + dim N = dim R then e(M, N ) > 0. Serre proved all of these in the case that R contains a field, the so-called “geometric case” (some non-geometric examples for R include power series rings over the padic integers Zp ). Serre also proved (1) in general. Conjecture (3) was proven in the mid 80s by Roberts and Gillet-Soule (independently), using some sophisticated topological ideas that were imported into algebra. Conjecture (2) was proven by Gabber in the mid 90s, using some high-tech algebraic geometry. Conjecture (4) is still open.

There are certain generalized cohomology theories—called complex-oriented — which have a close connection to geometry and intersection theory. Any such cohomology can be used to detect intersection multiplicities. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 8</a>)</p>
Topological K-theory is a complex-oriented cohomology theory. Elements of the groups K ∗ (X) are specified by vector bundles on X, or more generally by bounded chain complexes of vector bundles on X. Fundamental classes for complex submanifolds of X are given by resolutions. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 8</a>)</p>
When X is an algebraic variety there is another version of K-theory called algebraic K-theory, which we might denote K ∗ alg (X). The analogs of vector bundles are locally free coherent sheaves, or just finitely-generated projective modules when X is affine. Thus, in the affine case elements of K ∗ alg (X) can be specified by bounded chain complexes of finitely-generated projective modules. This is the main connection between homological algebra and K-theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 8</a>)</p>

(4) Serre’s definition of intersection multiplicities essentially comes from the intersection product in K-homology, which is the cup product in K-cohomology translated to homology via Poincaré Duality. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=9" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 9</a>)</p>
Theorem 2.1 (Hilbert Syzygy Theorem). Let k be a field and let R be k[x1 , . . . , xn ] (or any localization of this ring). Then every finitely-generated R-module has a free resolution of length at most n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 10</a>)</p>
We mention it here because it implies that Torj (M, N ) = 0 for j > n. Therefore the sum in Serre’s formula is actually finite. More generally, a ring is called regular if every finitely-generated module has a finite, projective resolution. It is a theorem that localizations of regular rings are again regular. Hilbert’s Syzygy Theorem simply says that polynomial rings over a field are regular. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 10</a>)</p>
The importance of this observation is that it tells us that the Tor’s in Serre’s formula may all be taken over the ring RP . So we might as well work over this ring from beginning to end (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 10</a>)</p>
Lemma 2.2. Suppose that 0 → M 0 → M → M 00 → 0 is a short exact sequence of R-modules. Then e(M, N ) = e(M 0 , N )+e(M 00 , N ), assuming all three multiplicities are defined (that is, under the assumption that dim C (M ⊗ N ) < ∞ and similarly with M replaced by M 0 and M 00 ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 11</a>)</p>
Lemma 2.2 is referred to as the additivity of intersection multiplicities. Of course the additivity holds equally well in the second variable, by the same argument. While exploring ideas in this general area, Grothendieck hit upon the idea of inventing a group that captures all the additive invariants of modules. Any invariant such as e(−, N ) would then factor through this group. Here is the definition: Definition 2.3. Let R be any ring. Let F(R) be the free abelian group with one generator [M ] for every isomorphism class of finitely-generated R-module M . Let G(R) be the quotient of F(R) by the subgroup generated by all elements [M ] − [M 0 ] − [M 00 ] for every short exact sequence 0 → M 0 → M → M 00 → 0 of finitely-generated Rmodules. The group G(R) is called the Grothendieck group of finitely-generated R-modules. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 11</a>)</p>
1) Suppose R = F , a field. Clearly G(F ) is generated by [F ], since every finitelygenerated F -module has the form F n (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 12</a>)</p>
More generally, suppose that R is a domain. The rank of an R-module M is defined to be the dimension of M ⊗R QF (R) over QF (R), where QF (R) is the quotient field. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 12</a>)</p>
Let G be a finite group, and let R = C [G] be the group algebra. So R-modules are just representations of G on complex vector spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 12</a>)</p>
For a not-so-simple example, let R be the ring of integers in a number field. It turns out that G(R) ∼ = ∼ = Z ⊕ Cl(R), where Cl(R) is the ideal class group of R. This class group contains some sophisticated number-theoretic information about R. It is known to always be torsion, and it is usually nontrivial. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 12</a>)</p>
All finitely-generated R-modules have a finite composition series, and so we can take the Jordan-Hölder length; this is the same as `(A) = dim Z/p A/pA + dim Z/p pA. With some trouble one can check that this is indeed an additive invariant (or refer to the Jordan-Hölder theorem), and of course `( Z /p) = 1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 13</a>)</p>
Definition 2.7. Let R be any ring. Let FK (R) be the free abelian group with one generator [P ] for every isomorphism class of finitely-generated, projective Rmodule M . Let K(R) be the quotient of FK (R) by the subgroup generated by all elements [P ] − [P 0 ] − [P 00 ] for every short exact sequence 0 → P 0 → P → P 00 → 0 of finitely-generated projectives. The group K(R) is called the Grothendieck group of finitely-generated projective modules. Every short exact sequence of projectives is actually split, so we could also have defined K(R) by imposing the relations [P ⊕ Q] = [P ] + [Q] for every two finitelygenerated projectives P and Q. This makes it a little easier to understand when two modules represent the same class in K(R (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 13</a>)</p>
Proposition 2.8. Let P and Q be finitely-generated projective R-modules. Then [P ] = [Q] in K(R) if and only if there exists a finitely-generated projective module W such that P ⊕ W ∼ = ∼ = Q ⊕ W . In fact, the same remains true if we require W to be free instead of projective. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 14</a>)</p>
For the last statement in the proposition, just observe that since W is projective it is a direct summand of a free module. That is, there exists a module W 0 such that W ⊕W 0 is finitely-genereated and free (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 14</a>)</p>
Since projective modules are flat, the product [P ]·[Q] = [P ⊗R Q] is additive and so extends to a product K(R)⊗K(R) → K(R).

Remark 2.9. Given the motivation of having the tensor product give a ring structure, one might wonder why we used projective modules to define K(R) rather than flat modules. We could have done so, but for finitely-generated modules over commutative, Noetherian rings, being flat and projective are equivalent notions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 14</a>)</p>

For any ring R, we have the group K(R) which also comes to us with an easily-defined ring structure ⊗. We also have the group G(R)—but this does not have any evident ring structure. When R is regular, there is an isomorphism K(R) → G(R) which allows one to transplant the ring structure from K(R) onto G(R): and this leads us directly to our alternating-sum-of-Tors (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 16</a>)</p>
from K(R) onto G(R): and this leads us directly to our alternating-sum-of-Tors. This situation is very reminiscent of something you have seen in a basic algebraic topology course. When X is a (compact, oriented) manifold, there were early attempts to put a ring structure on H∗ (X) coming from the intersection product. This is technically very difficult. In modern times one avoids these technicalities by instead introducing the cohomology groups H ∗ (X), and here it is easy to define a ring structure: the cup product. When X is a compact, oriented manifold one has the Poincaré Duality isomorphism H ∗ (X) → H∗ (X) given by capping with the fundamental class, and this lets one transplant the cup product onto H∗ (X). This is the modern approach to intersection theory.

The parallels here are intriguing: K(R) is somehow like H ∗ (X), and G(R) is somehow like H∗ (X). The regularity condition is like being a manifold.

[The reader might wonder what happened to the assumptions of compactness and orientability. Neither of these is really needed for Poincaré Duality, as long as one does things correctly. For the version of Poincaré Duality for noncompact manifolds one needs to replace ordinary homology with Borel-Moore homology—this is similar to singular homology, but chains are permitted to have infinitely many terms if they stretch out to infinity. For non-orientable manifolds one needs to use twisted coefficients (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 16</a>)</p>

Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz says that points of C n are in bijective correspondence with maximal ideals in R: the bijection sends q = (q1 , . . . , qn ) to mq = (x1 −q1 , . . . , xn −qn ). With a little work one can generalize this bijection. If S ⊆ C n is any subset, define I(S) = {f ∈ R | f (x) = 0 for all x ∈ S}. This is an ideal in R, in fact a radical ideal (meaning that if f n ∈ I(S) then f ∈ I(S)). In the other direction, if I ⊆ R is any ideal then define V (I) = {x ∈ C n | f (x) = 0 for all f ∈ I}. Notice that V (mq ) = {q} and I({q}) = mq . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 17</a>)</p>
An algebraic set in C n is any subset of the form V (I) for some ideal I ⊆ R. The algebraic sets form the closed sets for a topology on C n , called the Zariski topology. One form of the Nullstellensatz says that V and I give a bijection between algebraic sets and radical ideals in R. Under this bijection the prime ideals correspond to irreducible algebraic sets—ones that cannot be written as X ∪ Y where both X and Y are proper closed subsets. Algebraic sets are also called algebraic subvarieties. The above discussion is summarized in the following table: Geometry Algebra C n or An nC nC C [x1 , . . . , xn ] = R Points (q1 , . . . , qn ) Maximal ideals (x1 − q1 , . . . , xn − qn ) Algebraic sets Radical ideals Irreducible algebraic sets Prime ideals (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 17</a>)</p>
The ring R is best thought of as the set of maps of varieties A n → A 1 , with pointwise addition and multiplication. If we restrict to some irreducible subvariety X = V (P ) ⊆ A n instead, then the ring of functions X → A 1 is R/P . This ring of functions is commonly called the coordinate ring of X. Much of the dictionary between A n and R discussed above adapts verbatim to give a dictionary between X and its coordinate ring: Geometry Algebra X = V (P ) C [x1 , . . . , xn ]/P = R/P Points in X Maximal ideals in R/P Algebraic subsets V (I) ⊆ X Radical ideals in R/P Irreducible algebraic sets V (Q) ⊆ X Prime ideals in R/P . Note that ideals in R/P correspond bijectively to ideals in R containing P , and likewise for prime (respectively, radical) ideals.

We need one last observation. Passing from A n to A n+1 corresponds algebraically to passing from R to R[t]. If X = V (P ) ⊆ A n is an irreducible algebraic set, then X × A 1 ⊆ A n+1 is V (P [t]) where P [t] ⊆ R[t]. That is, the coordinate ring of X is R/P and the coordinate ring of X × A 1 is R[t]/P [t] = (R/P )[t]. We supplement our earlier tables with the following line: Geometry Algebra X X × A 1 S S[t] We have defined G(−) and K(−) as functors taking rings as their inputs, but we could also think of them as taking varieties (or schemes) as their inputs (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 17</a>)</p>
Theorem 2.15. If R is Noetherian, the Grothendieck group G(R) is generated by the set of elements [R/P ] where P ⊆R is prime. Before proving this result let us comment on the significance. When X is a topological space, the groups H∗ (X) have a geometric presentation in terms of “cycles” and “homologies”. The cycles are, of course, generators for the group. The definition of G(R) doesn’t look anything like this, but Theorem 2.15 says that the group is indeed generated by classes that have the feeling of “algebraic cycles” on the variety Spec R (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 18</a>)</p>
It is worth pointing out that in H∗ (X) the cycles are strictly separated by dimension—the dimensions i cycles are confined to the single group Hi (X)—whereas in G(R) the cycles of different dimensions are all inhabiting the same group. This is one of the main differences between K-theory and singular homology/cohomology.

Lemma 2.16. Let R be a Noetherian ring. For any finitely-generated R-module M , there exists a prime ideal P ⊆R and an embedding R/P ,→ M . Equivalently, there is some z∈M whose annihilator is prime.

If M is an R-module, write M [t] for the R[t]-module M ⊗R R[t]. The functor M→ 7 M [t] is exact, because R[t] is flat over R (in fact, it is even free). So we have an induced map α : G(R) → G(R[t]) given by [M ] 7→ [M [t]]. Theorem 2.18 (Homotopy invariance). If R is Noetherian, α : G(R) → G(R[t]) is an isomorphism. We comment on the name “homotopy invariance” for the above result. If X = Spec R then Spec R[t] = X × A 1 , so the result says that G(−) gives the same values on X and X × A 1 . This is reminiscent of a functor on topological spaces giving the same values on X and X × I.

Recall that a module is projective if and only if it is a direct summand of a free module. So free modules are projective, and for almost all applications in homological algebra one can get by with using only free modules. Consequently, it is common not to know many examples of non-free projectives. We begin this section by remedying this.

Let R = Z /6.

This example generalizes: if D is a Dedekind domain (such as the ring of integers in an algebraic number field) then every ideal I ⊆ D is projective. Non-principal ideals are never free.

Let R = R [x, y, z]/(x 2 + y 2 + z 2 − 1). If C(S 2 ) denotes the ring of continuous functions S 2 → R , note that we may regard R as sitting inside of C(S 2 ): it is the subring of polynomial functions on the 2-sphere. The connections with the topology of the 2-sphere will be important below. Let π : R 3 → R be the map  π(f, g,h) = xf + yg + zh. That is, π is leftmultiplication by the matrix x y z . Let T be the kernel of π: 0 → T ,→ R 3 π π −→ R → 0.

The map π is split via χ : R → R3 sending 1 7→ (x, y, z). We conclude that T ⊕R ∼ = ∼ = R 3 , so T is projective.

Note that T is, in some sense, an algebraic analog of the tangent bundle of S 2 . These parallels between projective modules and vector bundles are very important, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 22</a>)</p>
This example is based on the Möbius bundle over S 1 . Let S = R [x, y]/(x 2 + y 2 − 1) and let R ⊆ S be the span of the even degree monomials. One should regard S as the ring of polynomial functions on the circle, and R is the ring of polynomial functions f (x, y) satisfying f (x, y) = f (−x, −y). So R is trying to be the ring of polynomial functions on R P 1 (which happens to be homeomorphic to S 1 ).

A projective module P is called stably free if there exists a free module F such that P ⊕ F is free (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 22</a>)</p>
. It turns out that K(R) can be used to tell us whether such modules exist or not (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 22</a>)</p>

In the 1950s, Serre conjectured that every finitely-generated projective over F [x1 , . . . , xn ] is actually free. As we will see later (Remark 11.5 below), the motivation for this conjecture is inspired by topology and the connection between vector bundles and projective modules. Quillen and Suslin independently proved Serre’s conjecture in the 1970s.

Proposition 3.1. Let R be a commutative ring. The following are equivalent: (1) K(R) ∼ = ∼ =Z (2) K e K(R) = 0 e (3) Every finitely-generated, projective R-module is stably-free.

Remark 4.3. Theorem 4.1 gives another parallel between G(−) and singular homology. If X = Spec R then A = Spec R/f is a closed subscheme, and Spec f −1 R = X − A is the open complement (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 24</a>)</p>
So the sequence in Theorem 4.1 can be written as G(A) → G(X) → G(X − A) → 0. This is somewhat reminiscent of the long exact sequence in singular homology · · · → H∗ (A) → H∗ (X) → H∗ (X, A) → · · · (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 24</a>)</p>
The second thing is to recall something you probably learned in a basic algebra class, namely the Jordan-Hölder Theorem.

Lemma 5.3. If P and Q are bounded below complexes of projectives, then every quasi-isomorphism is a chain homotopy equivalence.

This lemma lets us replace the words “chain homotopy equivalence” with “quasiisomorphism” in any statement about bounded, projective complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 30</a>)</p>
). The advantage of doing this is simply that quasi-isomorphisms are somewhat easier to identify than chain homotopy equivalences.

why complicate things by making the defintion using complexes of arbitrary length? The answer comes from algebraic geometry. Let X be a scheme and let U be an open subset of X. Then the ‘correct’ way to define a relative K-theory group K(X, U ) is to use bounded chain complexes of locally free sheaves on X that are exact on U . When X = Spec R and U = Spec S −1 R then it happens that one can get the same groups using only complexes of length one—as we saw above. But even for X = Spec R not every open subset is of this form. A general subset will have the form U = (Spec S −1 R) ∪ (Spec S −1 R) ∪ · · · ∪ (Spec S −1 R), but to get the same relative K-group here one must use complexes of length at most d (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=34" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 34</a>)</p>

Let R be a Noetherian ring, and let Z ⊆ Spec R be a Zariski closed set. Recall that an R-module M is said to be supported on Z if MP = 0 for all primes P ∈ / Z.

Our next goal in these notes is to explore the idea of doing linear algebra locally over a fixed base space X. To be slightly more precise, our objects of interest will be maps of spaces E → X where the fibers carry the structure of vector spaces; a map from E → X to E 0 → X is a continuous map F : E → E 0 , commuting with the maps down to X, such that F is a linear transformation on each fiber. It turns out that much of linear algebra carries over easily to this enhanced setting. But there are more isomorphism types of objects here, because the topology of X allows for some twisting in the vector space structure of the fibers. The surprise is that studying these ‘twisted vector spaces’ over a base space X quickly leads to interesting homotopy invariants of X! Topological K-theory is a cohomology theory for topological spaces that arises out of this study of fibrewise linear algebra (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=50" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 50</a>)</p>
Definition 8.1. A family of (real) vector spaces is a map p : E → X together with operations + : E ×X E → E and · : R × E → E making the two diagrams E ×X E HH H$ H H H H H H H E H + E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ R × EF · F# F F F F F F F /E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ X X commute, and such that the operations make each fiber p −1 (x) into a real vector space over X. One could write down the above definition completely category-theoretically, in terms of maps and commutative diagrams. Essentially one is defining a “vector space object” in the category of spaces over X.

notion is too wild to be of much use: there are too many ‘crazy’ families of vector spaces like this one. One fixes this by adding a condition that forces the fibers to vary continuously, in a certain sense. This is done as follows: Definition 8.3. A vector bundle is a family of vector spaces p : E → X such that for each x ∈ X there is a neighborhood x ∈ U ⊆ X, an n ∈ Z≥0 , and an isomorphism of families of vector spaces p −1 (U ) F # F F F F F F F ∼ = ∼ = / U × R n w{ w w w w w w w w U Usually one simply says that a vector bundle is a family of vector spaces that is locally trivial. The isomorphism in the above diagram is called a “local trivialization”.

The family of vector spaces from Example 8.2(c) perhaps makes it clear that this notion is too wild to be of much use: there are too many ‘crazy’ families of vector (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 51</a>)</p>
Let X = R . Let e1 , e2 be the standard basis for R 2 . Let E ⊆ X × R 2 be the union of {(x, re1 ) | x ∈ Q, r ∈ R} and {(x, re2 ) | x ∈ X\Q, r ∈ R}. Recall from (a) that X × R 2 → X is a family of vector spaces, and note that E becomes a sub-family of vector spaces under the same operations.

Remark 8.4. Note that the n appearing in Definition 8.3 depends on the point x. It is called the rank of the vector bundle at x, and denoted rankx (E). It is easy to prove that the rank is constant on the connected components of X.

Notation 8.5. If p : E → X is a family of vector spaces and A ,→ X is a subspace, then p −1 (A) → A is also a family of vector spaces. We will usually write this restriction as E|A . Note that if E is a vector bundle then so is E|A , by a simple argument. The construction E|A is a special case of a pullback bundle, which we will discuss in Section 8.9. Of the families of vector spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 51</a>)</p>
we considered in Example 8.2, only the trivial family from (a) is a vector bundle. Before discussing more interesting examples, it will be useful to have a mechanism for deciding when a family of vector spaces is trivial. If p : E → X is a family of vector spaces, a section of p is a map s : X → E such that ps = id. The set of sections is denoted Γ(E), and this becomes a vector space using pointwise addition and multiplication in the fibers of E. A collection of sections s1 , . . . , sr is linearly independent if the vectors s1 (x), s2 (x), . . . , sr (x) are linearly independent in Ex for every x ∈ X.

Proposition 8.6. Let E → X be a family of vector spaces of constant rank n. Then the family is trivial if and only if there is a linearly independent collection of sections s1 , s2 , . . . , sn .

(a) Let φ : R n → R n be a vector space isomorphism. Let E 0 = [0, 1] × R n and let E be the quotient of E 0 by the relation (0, v) ∼ (1, φ(v)). Identifying S 1 with the quotient of [0, 1] by 0 ∼ 1, we obtain a map E → S 1 that is clearly a family of vector spaces. We claim this is a vector bundle. If x ∈ (0, 1) then it is evident that E is locally trivial at x, so the only point of concern is x = 0 = 1 ∈ S 1 . Let e1 , . . . , en be the standard basis for R n , and let si : [0, 41 41 ] → E 0 be the constant section whose value is ei . Likewise, let s0 i i : ( 4 , 1] → E 0 be the constant section whose value is φ(ei ). Projecting into E we obtain si (0) = s 0i (1), and so the sections si and s0 i patch together to give a section Si : U → E, where U = [0, 41 1 ) ∪ ( 34 , 1]. The sections S1 , . . . , Sn are independent and therefore give a local trivialization of E over U . When n = 1 and φ(x) = −x the resulting bundle is the Möbius bundle M , depicted below: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=52" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 52</a>)</p>
Let X = R P n , and let L ⊆ X × R n+1 be the set L = {(l, v) | l ∈ R P n , x ∈ l}. Then L is a subfamily of the trivial family, and we claim that it is a line bundle over X. To see this, for any l ∈ X we must produce a local trivialization. By symmetry it suffices to do this when l = he1 i. Let U ⊆ RP n be the set of lines whose orthogonal projection to he1 i is nonzero. Such a line contains a unique vector of the form e1 + u where e1 · u = 0. Define s : U → L by sending l to (l, e1 + u) where e1 + u is the unique point on l described above. This section is clearly nonzero everywhere, so it gives a trivialization of L|U . Thus, we have proven that L is locally trivial and hence a vector bundle. The bundle L is called the tautological line bundle over R P n . Do not confuse this with the canonical line bundle over R P n that we will define shortly (they are duals of each other). Note that when n = 1 the bundle L is isomorphic to the Möbius bundle on S 1 .

Projection to the first coordinate π : η → Grk (V ) makes η into a rank k vector bundle, called the tautological bundle over Grk (V ).

Pullback bundles can be slightly non-intuitive. Let M → S 1 be the Möbius bundle, and let f : S 1 → S 1 be the map z 7→ z 2 . We claim that f ∗ M ∼ = 1. This is easiest to see if one uses the following model for M : M = n e iθ , re i θ θ 2 θ ∈ [0, 2π], r ∈ R o (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=53" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 53</a>)</p>
We may form a new bundle E ⊕ E 0 , whose underlying topological space is just the pullback E ×X E 0 . So a point in E ⊕ F is a pair (e, e0 ) where p(e) = p0 (e0 ). The rules for vector addition and scalar multiplication are the evident ones. Note that the fiber of E ⊕ E 0 over a point x is simply Ex ⊕ Ex0 .

More generally, any canonical construction one can apply to vector spaces may be extended to apply to vector bundles. So one can talk about the bundles E ⊗ E 0 , the dual bundle E ∗ , the hom-bundle Hom(E, E 0 ), the exterior product bundle /\ i E, and so on (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 54</a>)</p>
Recall that if fA : A → Y and fB : B → Y are continuous maps that agree on A ∩ B then we may patch these together to get a continuous map f : X → Y provided that either (i) A and B are both closed, or (ii) A and B are both open. This is a basic fact about topological spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=55" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 55</a>)</p>
closed, or (ii) A and B are both open. This is a basic fact about topological spaces. The analogous facts for vector bundles are very similar in the case of an open cover, but more subtle for closed covers. Proposition 8.15. Let E → X be a family of vector spaces. (a) If {Uα } is an open cover of X and each E|Uα is a vector bundle, then E is a vector bundle. (b) Suppose {A, B} is a cover of X by closed subspaces, and that for every x ∈ A∩B and every open neighborhood x ∈ U ⊆ X there exists a neighborhood x ∈ V ⊆ U such that V ∩ A ∩ B ,→ V ∩ B has a retraction. Then if E|A and E|B are both vector bundles, so is E.

(ii) The two isomorphisms φγ,α and φγ,β ◦ φβ,α agree on their common domain of definition, which is Eα |Uα ∩Uβ ∩Uγ .

Condition (ii) above is usually called the cocycle condition. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=56" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 56</a>)</p>
To see why, consider the case where all of the Eα ’s are trivial bundles of rank n. Then the data in the φα,β maps is really just the data of a map gα,β : Uα ∩ Uβ → GLn (R). These (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=56" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 56</a>)</p>
gα,β maps are called transition functions. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 57</a>)</p>
Condition (ii) is the requirement that the transition functions assemble to give a C Č Čech 1-cocycle with values in the group GLn (R) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 57</a>)</p>
We will see in a moment (Corollary 8.23) that for real vector bundles over paracompact Hausdorff spaces one always has E ∼ = ∼ = E ∗ , although the isomorphism is not canonical. This is not true for complex or quaternionic bundles, however (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 57</a>)</p>
Let L → C P n be the tautological complex line bundle over C P n . Its (complex) dual L ∗ is called the canonical line bundle over C P n .

Whereas from a topological standpoint neither L nor L ∗ holds a preferential position over the other, in algebraic geometry there is an important difference between the two. The difference comes from the fact that L ∗ has certain “naturally defined” sections, whereas L does not (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 57</a>)</p>
For a point z = [z0 : · · · : zn ] ∈ CP n , Lz is the complex line in C n+1 spanned by (z0 , . . . , zn ). Given only z ∈ CP n there is no evident way of writing down a point on Lz , without making some kind of arbitrary choice; said differently, the bundle L does not have any easily-described sections. In contrast, it is much easier to write down a functional on Lz . For example, let φi be the unique functional on Lz that sends the point (z0 , . . . , zn ) to zi . Notice that this description depends only on z ∈ C P n , not the point (z0 , . . . , zn ) ∈ Cn+1 that represents it; that is, the functional sending (λz0 , . . . , λzn ) to λzi is the same as φi . In this way we obtain an entire C n+1 ’s worth of sections for L ∗ , by taking linear combinations of the φi ’s. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 57</a>)</p>
To be clear, it is important to realize that L has plenty of sections—it is just that one cannot describe them by simple formulas. The slogan to remember is that the bundle L ∗ has algebraic sections, whereas L does not. In algebraic geometry the bundle L ∗ is usually denoted O(1), whereas L is denoted O(−1). More generally, O(n) denotes (L∗ )⊗n when n ≥ 0 (so that O(0) is the trivial line bundle), and denotes L ⊗(−n) when n < 0 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 57</a>)</p>
Definition 8.21. Let E → X be a real vector bundle. An inner product on E is a map of vector bundles E ⊗ E → 1 that induces a positive-definite, symmetric, bilinear form on each fiber Ex . A vector bundle with an inner product is usually called an orthogonal vector bundle.

Every complex vector space may be equipped with a nondegenerate, symmetric bilinear form (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=58" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 58</a>)</p>
Inner products on R n are in bijective correspondence with symmetric, positive-definite matrices A ∈ Mn×n (R), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 59</a>)</p>

Now consider the fibration sequence On ,→ GLn (R) → GLn (R)/On . The projection map sends a matrix P to P In P T = P P T . The inclusion On ,→ GLn (R) is a homotopy equivalence by Gram-Schmidt, and so GLn (R)/On is weakly contractible. Standard techniques show that this homogeneous space may be given the structure of a CW-complex (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 59</a>)</p>
Suppose that E → X is a rank n real vector bundle with an inner product. Choose a trivializing open cover {Uα }, and for each α fix an inner-productpreserving trivialization fα : E|Uα → Uα × Rn where the codomain has the standard inner product (this is possible by Proposition 8.25). The transition functions gα,β : Uα ∩ Uβ → GLn (R) therefore factor through On , as they must preserve the inner product. This process is usually referred to as reduction of the structure group.

We claim that the projection map p1 : Z → W is a fiber bundle with fiber Rk(n−k) , but defer the proof for just a moment. The fact that the fiber is contractible then shows that p1 is weak homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=61" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 61</a>)</p>
Proposition 9.2. Let X be a paracompact space. Then any surjection of bundles E  F has a splitting. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=61" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 61</a>)</p>
Proof. Briefly, we choose local splittings and then use a partition of unity to patch them together (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=61" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 61</a>)</p>
Proposition 9.3. Let X be any space, and let f : E → F be a map of vector bundles over X. If f has constant rank then ker f , coker f , and im f are vector bundles.

Corollary 9.4. Let X be a paracompact space. Then any injection of bundles E ,→ F has a splitting. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=62" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 62</a>)</p>
Proposition 9.5. Suppose that X is compact and Hausdorff. Then every bundle is a subbundle of some trivial bundle.

Lemma 9.7. Let E α α −→ F β −→ G be an exact sequence of vector bundles. Then im α (which equals ker β) is a vector bundle.

In this section we explore our first connection between topology and algebra. We will see that vector bundles are closely related to projective modules.

The assignment E 7→ Γ(E) gives a functor from vector bundles to C(X)-modules. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=64" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 64</a>)</p>
When X is a space let C(X) denote the ring of continuous functions from X to R , where the addition and multiplication are pointwise (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=64" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 64</a>)</p>
It is easy to check that Γ is a left-exact functor (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=64" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 64</a>)</p>
If E → X is a vector bundle then of course the modules of the form Γ(E) are not just arbitrary C(X)-modules; there is something special about them. It is easiest to say what this is under some assumptions on X: Proposition 10.1. If X is compact and Hausdorff, and E is a vector bundle over X, then Γ(E) if a finitely-generated, projective module over C(X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=64" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 64</a>)</p>
That is, Γ(E) is a direct summand of a free module; hence it is projective. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=64" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 64</a>)</p>
For the rest of this section we will assume that our base spaces are compact and Hausdorff. Let hhVect(X)ii denote the category of vector bundles over X, and let hhMod −C(X)ii denote the category of modules over the ring C(X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=64" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 64</a>)</p>
hhProj −C(X)ii denote the full subcategory of finitely-generated, projective modules. Then Γ is a functor hhVect(X)ii → hhProj −C(X)ii. It is proven in [Sw] that this is actually an equivalence: Theorem 10.2 (Swan’s Theorem). Let X be a compact, Hausdorff space. Then Γ : hhVect(X)ii → hhProj −C(X)ii is an equivalence of categories. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 65</a>)</p>
To prove this result we need to verify two things: • Every finitely-generated projective over C(X) is isomorphic to Γ(E) for some vector bundle E. • For every two vector bundles E and F , the induced map Γ : HomVect(X) (E, F ) → HomC(X) (ΓE, ΓF ) is a bijection. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 65</a>)</p>
That is to say, we need to prove that Γ is surjective on isomorphism classes, and is fully faithful (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 65</a>)</p>
Note that we have the evaluation map evx : Γ(E) → Ex . This map clearly sends the submodule mx Γ(E) to zero. Lemma 10.4. Assume that X is paracompact Hausdorff. Then for any vector bundle E → X and any x ∈ X, the map evx : Γ(E)/mx Γ(E) ∼ = ∼ = = −→ Ex is an isomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=66" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 66</a>)</p>
Our final goal is to prove that Γ is fully faithful. To do this, it is useful to relate the fibers Ex of our bundle to an algebraic construction based on the module Γ(E). For each x ∈ X consider the evaluation map evx : C(X) → R, and let mx be the kernel. The ideal mx ⊆ C(X) is maximal, since the quotient is a field.

Proposition 10.5. Assume that X is paracompact Hausdorff. Then for any vector bundles E and F over X, the map Γ : HomVect(X) (E, F ) → HomC(X) (ΓE, ΓF ) is a bijection.

For a fixed n, let Vectn (X) denote the set of isomorphism classes of vector bundles on X. It turns out that when X is a finite complex this set is always countable, and often finite. It actually gives a homotopy invariant of the space X.

Example 11.3. To give an idea how we will apply these results, let us think about vector bundles on S 1 . Divide S 1 into an upper hemisphere D+ and a lower hemisphere D− , intersecting in two points. Each of D+ and D− are contractible, so any vector bundle will be trivializable when restricted to these subspaces. Given two elements α, β ∈ GLn (R), let En (α, β) be the vector bundle on S 1 obtained by taking n D+ and n D− and gluing them together via α and β at the two points on the equator. The considerations of the previous paragraph tell us that every vector bundle on S 1 is of this form (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=68" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 68</a>)</p>
In (2) we have used the fact that π0 (GLn (R)) = Z/2, with the isomorphism being given by the sign of the determinant. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=68" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 68</a>)</p>
To summarize, from (1) and (2) it follows that isomorphism types for rank n bundles over S 1 are in bijective correspondence with the path components of GLn (R). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=69" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 69</a>)</p>
The methods of the above example apply in much greater generality, and with little change allow one to get control over vector bundles on any suspension.

Remark 11.5. We have seen that all bundles on contractible spaces are trivial, and that there is a close connection between vector bundles and projective modules. Recall that when k is a field then k[x1 , . . . , xn ] is the algebraic analog of affine space A n , and that projectives over this ring correspond to algebraic vector bundles. The analogy with topology is what led Serre to conjecture that all finitely-generated projectives over k[x1 , . . . , xn ] are free (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 70</a>)</p>
We have proven that if E is a vector bundle on X × I then i∗0 (E) ∼ = ∼ i = ∗ 1 (E). It is natural to wonder if this result has a converse, but stating such a thing is somewhat tricky (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 70</a>)</p>
So we find ourselves in somewhat of a muddle. Perhaps there is an interesting question here, but we don’t quite know how to ask it. One approach is to restrict to a class of bundles where “equality” is something we can better control (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 70</a>)</p>
We may view a vector bundle as a family of vector spaces indexed by the base space. In general, we may view a map X → Y as a family of blah if each fiber is a blah.

We naively hope that families of some mathematical object over X are in bijection with maps from X to some space, called the moduli space corresponding to that mathematical object.

some space, called the moduli space corresponding to that mathematical object. With this naive idea, we would hope that families over ∗ are in bijective correspondence with points of our moduli space. However, this does not work since the moduli space of R n ’s is ∗.

V ⊆ W then we get an induced inclusion of Grassmannians Grk (V ) ,→ Grk (W ). Consider the standard chain of inclusions of Euclidean spaces R k , and define the infinite Grassmannian Grn (R ∞ ) to be the colimit of the induced sequence of finite Grassmannians: Grn (R ∞ ) = colim k→∞ [Grn (R k )].

Define γn → Grn (R∞ ) by γn = {(V, x) | V ⊂ R∞ , dim(V ) = n, x ∈ V }. This is the tautological vector bundle on the infinite grassmanian.

To any map f : X → Grn (R∞ ) we associate the pullback bundle f ∗ γn / γn  X f / Grn (R ∞ ). The assignment f 7→ f ∗ γn gives a map Hom(X, Grn (R∞ )) → Vectn (X). Observe that if f, g : X → Grn (R∞ ) are homotopic maps, then f ∗ γn ∼ = g ∗ γn by Corollary 11.2(a). In this way we have constructed a map φ : [X, Grn (R ∞ )] → Vectn (X). We will show that this is an isomorphism when X is compact and Hausdorff (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 71</a>)</p>
Theorem 11.8. The map φ : [X, Grn (R ∞ )] → Vectn (X) is always injective, and is bijective when X is compact and Hausdorff.

Proposition 11.10. Let X be a finite-dimensional CW-complex. For real vector bundles, Vectn (X) → Vectn+1 (X) is a bijection for n ≥ dim X + 1 and a surjection for n = dim X. For complex bundles, VectC n n C (X) → Vectn n+1 (X) is a bijection for n ≥ 21 dim X and a surjection for n ≥ 12 (dim X − 1).

Fix a space X. If E → X is a vector bundle of rank n, then of course E ⊕ 1 is a vector bundle of rank n + 1. We get a sequence of maps Vect0 (X) ⊕1 −→ Vect1 (X) ⊕1 −→ Vect2 (X) ⊕1 −→ · · · Are these maps injective? Surjective? Are there more and more isomorphism classes of vector bundles as one goes up in rank, or is it the case that all “large” rank vector bundles actually come from smaller ones via addition of a trivial bundle? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=72" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 72</a>)</p>
rank vector bundles actually come from smaller ones via addition of a trivial bundle? A homotopical analysis of classifying spaces allow us give some partial answers here.

this section we explore the set of isomorphism classes Vectn (S k ) for various values of k and n. There are two important points. First, for a fixed k these sets stablize for n 0. Secondly, Bott was able to compute these stable values completely and found an 8-fold periodicity (with respect to k) in the case of real vector bundles, and a 2-fold periodicity in the case of complex bundles. Bott’s periodicity theorems are of paramount importance in modern algebraic topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=72" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 72</a>)</p>

12.1. The clutching construction. Let X be a pointed space, and let C+ and C− be the positive and negative cones in ΣX. Fix n ≥ 0. For a map f : X → GLn (R), let En (f ) be the vector bundle obtained by gluing n|C+ and n|C− via the map f (we use Corollary 8.17(b) here). Precisely, if x ∈ X and v belongs to the fiber of n C+ over x then we glue v to f (x) · v in the fiber of n C− over x. This procedure for constructing vector bundles on ΣX is called clutching, and every bundle on ΣX arises in this way (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
Let us apply the above result when X is a sphere S k−1 . We obtain a bijection Vectn (S k ) ' πk−1 GLn (R). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
Recall that On ,→ GLn (R) is a deformation retraction, as a consequence of the Gram-Schmidt process (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
When k > 2 any based map S k−1 → On must actually factor through the connected component of the identity, which is SOn . So we have Vectn (S k ) ∼ = ∼ = πk−1 GLn (R) = ∼ = πk−1 On ∼ ∼ = ∼ = πk−1 SOn (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
12.3. Vector bundles on S 1 . For k = 1 and n > 0 we have that Vectn (S 1 ) ∼ = ∼ = π0 GLn (R) = Z/2, and we have previously seen in Example 11.3 that the two isomorphism classes are represented by n and M ⊕ (n − 1) where M is the Möbius bundle. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
12.4. Vector bundles on S 2 . Here we have Vectn (S 2 ) ∼ = ∼ = π1 SOn . Recall that SO2 ∼ = ∼ = S 1 , and so we get Vect2 (S 2 ) ∼ = ∼ = Z. We claim that for n > 2 one has π1 SOn ∼ = ∼ = Z/2, so that we have the following: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
Proposition 12.5. Vectn (S 2 ) ∼ = ∼ = π1 (SOn ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
For n = 3 recall that SO3 ∼ = ∼ = RP 3 , so that π1 (SO3 ) ∼ = ∼ = Z/2. To see the homeomorphism use the model R P 3 ∼ = ∼ = D 3 /∼ where the equivalence relation has x ∼ −x for x ∈ ∂D3 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
Proof. First of all SO1 = {1} and SO2 ∼ = ∼ = S 1 , so this takes care of n ≤ 2. For n = 3 recall that SO3 ∼ = ∼ = RP 3 , so (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
Map D 3 → SO3 by sending a vector v to the rotation of R3 with axis hvi, through |v| · π radians, in the direction given by a right-hand-rule with the thumb pointed along v. Note that this makes sense even for v = 0, since the corresponding rotation is through 0 radians. For x ∈ ∂D3 this map sends x and −x to the same rotation, and so induces a map R P 3 → SO3 . This is clearly a continuous bijection, and therefore a homeomorphism since the spaces are compact and Hausdorff. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=74" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 74</a>)</p>
For n ≥ 4 one can use the long exact sequence associated to the fibration SOn−1 ,→ SOn  S n−1 to deduce that π1 (SOn ) ∼ = π1 (SOn−1 ).

Definition 12.6. Let O(n) ∈ Vect2 (S 2 ) be the vector bundle Efn where fn : S 1 → SO2 is a map of degree n. Note that O(0) ∼ = 2. The bundles O(n), n ∈ Z , give a complete list of the rank 2 bundles on S 2 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=74" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 74</a>)</p>
Putting all of this information together, the following table shows all the vector bundles on S 2 : n 1 2 3 4 5 6 Vectn (S 2 ) 1 O(n), n ∈ Z 3, O(1) ⊕ 1 4, O(1) ⊕ 2 5, O(1) ⊕ 3 ··· The operation (−) ⊕ 1 moves us from one column of the table to the next (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=74" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 74</a>)</p>
answer, namely what happens when one adds two rank 2 bundles (all other sums can be figured out once one knows how to do these): Theorem 12.7. O(j) ⊕ O(k) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=74" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 74</a>)</p>
It is a standard fact in topology that the group structure on [S 1 , SO4 ]∗ given by (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=74" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 74</a>)</p>
pointwise multiplication agrees with the group structure given by concatenation of loops (this is true with SO4 replaced by any topological group). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 75</a>)</p>
12.8. Vector bundles on S 3 . Now we have to calculate π2 SOn . This is trivial for n ≤ 2 (easy), and for n = 3 it also trivial: use SO3 ∼ = ∼ = RP 3 and the fibration sequence Z /2 ,→ S 3  R P 3 . Finally, the fibration sequences SOn−1 ,→ SOn  S n−1 now show that π2 SOn = 0 for all n. We have proven Proposition 12.9. Vectn (S 3 ) ∼ = ∼ = π2 (SOn ) ∼ = ∼ = 0. That is, every vector bundle on S 3 is trivializable. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 75</a>)</p>
12.10. Vector bundles on S 4 . Once again, we are reduced to calculating π3 SOn . Eventually one expects to get stuck here, but so far we have been getting lucky so let’s keep trying (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 75</a>)</p>
12.12. Vector bundles on S k . Although we can not readily do the calculations for k > 4, at this point one sees the general pattern. One must calculate πk−1 SOn for each n, and these groups vary for a while but eventually stabilize. In fact, πi SOn ∼ = ∼ = πi SOn+1 for i + 1 < n. The calculation of these stable groups was an important problem back in the 1950s, that was eventually solved by Bott. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 75</a>)</p>
The colimit of this sequence is denoted O and called the stable orthogonal group. The homotopy groups of O are the stable values that we encountered above. We computed the first few: π0 O = Z/2, π1 O = Z /2, π2 O = 0. And we stated, without proof, that π3 O = Z. Bott’s calculation showed the following: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=76" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 76</a>)</p>
The pattern is 8-fold periodic: πi+8 O ∼ = ∼ = πi O for all i ≥ 0. One is supposed to remember the pattern of groups to the tune of “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star”: zee two zee two ze ro zee ze ro ze ro ze ro zee. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=76" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 76</a>)</p>
12.13. Complex vector bundles on spheres. One can repeat the above analysis for complex vector bundles on a sphere. One finds that VectC n n (S k ) ∼ = ∼ = πk−1 (GLn (C)) ∼ = ∼ = πk−1 (Un ), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=76" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 76</a>)</p>
The stable value in the last row turns out to be 0, although one cannot figure this out without computing a connecting homomorphism in the long exact homotopy sequence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=76" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 76</a>)</p>
We can write the stable value as πi U where U is the infinite unitary group defined as the colimit of U1 ,→ U2 ,→ U3 ,→ · · · Bott computed the homotopy groups of U to be 2-fold periodic, with πi U = ( Z if i is odd 0 if i is even. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=76" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 76</a>)</p>
For a compact and Hausdorff space X, let KO(X) denote the Grothendieck group of real vector bundles over X. Swan’s Theorem gives that KO(X) ∼ = ∼ = Kalg (C(X)), where the latter denotes the Grothendieck group of finitely-generated projectives (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=77" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 77</a>)</p>
We can repeat this definition for both complex and quaternionic bundles, to define groups KU (X) and KSp(X), respectively. The group KU (X) is most commonly just written K(X) for brevity (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=77" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 77</a>)</p>
Remark 13.4. Both KO st (X) and g KO g (X, x) appear often in algebraic topology, and topologists are somewhat cavalier about mixing them up. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=77" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 77</a>)</p>
Finally, here is a third description of KO st (X). Consider the chain of maps Vect0 (X) ⊕1 −→ Vect1 (X) ⊕1 −→ Vect2 (X) ⊕1 −→ · · · The colimit is clearly the set of equivalence classes described in the preceding paragraph, and therefore coincides with KO st (X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 78</a>)</p>
Let Gr∞ ( R ∞ ) denote the colimit of these maps Gr1 (R ∞ ) ⊕1 −→ Gr2 (R ∞ ) ⊕1 −→ Gr3 (R ∞ ) ⊕1 −→ · · · (we really want the homotopy colimit, if you know what that is, but in this case the colimit has the same homotopy type and is good enough). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 78</a>)</p>
You might recall that Grn (R ∞ ) is also called BOn , and likewise Gr∞ (R ∞ ) is also called BO. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 78</a>)</p>
So we have learned that KO st (X) ' [X, BO]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 78</a>)</p>
The calculations of Bott therefore give us the values of g KO g (S KO k ). For k = 0 observe that KO(S 0 ) = KO(∗ t ∗) ∼ = ∼ g (S 0 ) ∼ = Z ⊕ Z, so we have KO = Z. This lets us fill out the table: Table 13.4. Reduced KO-theory of spheres k 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ··· g KO (S g k ) Z Z /2 Z /2 0 Z 0 0 0 Z Z /2 Z /2 0 ··· (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 78</a>)</p>
Applying this in particular to X = S k we have that for k ≥ 1 KO g (S KO k ) ∼ = ∼ = KO st (S k ) ∼ = ∼ = [S k , BO] ∼ = ∼ = [S k , BO]∗ = πk (BO) = πk−1 (O). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 78</a>)</p>
Theorem 13.5 (Bott Periodicity, Strong version). There is a weak equivalence of spaces Z × BO ' Ω8 ( Z × BO). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=79" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 79</a>)</p>
Using Bott Periodicity we can then calculate that for every pointed space X one has g KO g (Σ KO 8 X) = [Σ 8 X, Z × BO]∗ = [X, Ω 8 ( Z × BO)]∗ = [X, Z × BO]∗ = KO g KO g (X). Remark 13.6. In the complex case, Bott Periodicity gives the weak equivalence Z × BU ' Ω2 ( Z × BU ). Consequently one obtains K e K(Σ 2 X) ∼ = ∼ = K e K(X) e for all pointed spaces X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=79" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 79</a>)</p>
Homotopy classes of maps into a fixed space Z always give rise to exact sequences: Proposition 13.8. Let X, Y be pointed spaces, and let f : X → Y be a pointed map. Consider the mapping cone Cf and the natural map p : Y → Cf . For any pointed space Z, the sequence of pointed sets [X, Z]∗ ← [Y, Z]∗ ← [Cf, Z]∗ is exact in the middle. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=79" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 79</a>)</p>
Note that Cj0 ' ΣX and Cj1 ' ΣY (this is clear from the pictures). Up to sign the map Cj0 → Cj1 is just Σf , so that the sequence of spaces becomes periodic: X → Y → Cf → ΣX → ΣY → Σ(Cf ) → Σ 2 X → . . . This is called the Puppe sequence. Note that the composition of two subsequent maps is null-homotopic, and that every three successive terms form a cofiber sequence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=80" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 80</a>)</p>
Given f : X → Y we form the mapping cone Cf , which comes to us with an inclusion j0 : Y ,→ Cf . Next form the mapping cone on i, which comes with an inclusion j1 : Cf ,→ Cj0 . Keep doing this forever to get the sequence of spaces X → Y → Cf → Cj0 → Cj1 → · · · depicted below: Note that Cj0 ' ΣX and Cj1 ' ΣY (this is clear from the pictures). Up (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=80" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 80</a>)</p>
Now let Z be a fixed space and apply [−, Z]∗ to the Puppe sequence. We obtain the sequence of pointed sets [X, Z]∗ ← [Y, Z]∗ ← [Cf, Z]∗ ← [ΣX, Z]∗ ← [ΣY, Z]∗ ← [Σ(Cf ), Z]∗ ← . . . By Proposition 13.8 this sequence is exact at every spot where this makes sense (everywhere except at [X, Z]∗ ). At the left end this is just an exact sequence of pointed sets, but as one moves to the right at some point it becomes an exact sequence of groups (namely, at [ΣY, Z]∗ ). As one moves further to the right, it becomes an exact sequence of abelian groups by the time one gets to [Σ 2 Y, Z]∗ . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=80" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 80</a>)</p>
Definition 13.9. An infinite loop space is a space Z0 together with spaces Z1 , Z2 , Z3 , . . . and weak homotopy equivalences Zn ' ΩZn+1 for all n ≥ 0. Note that if Z is an infinite loop space then we really do get a long exact sequence—infinite in both directions—consisting entirely of abelian groups, having the form · · · ← [Cf, Zi+1 ] ← [X, Zi ]∗ ← [Y, Zi ]∗ ← [Cf, Zi ]∗ ← [X, Zi−1 ] ← · · · (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 81</a>)</p>
where it is convenient to use the indexing convention Z−n = Ω n Z for n > 0. This situation is very reminiscent of a long exact sequence in cohomology, so let us adopt the following notation: write E i (X) = [X+ , Zi ]∗ = ( [X+ , Zi ]∗ i ≥ 0, [Σ −i (X+ ), Z0 ]∗ i < 0. For an inclusion of subspaces j : A ,→ X write E i Z (X, A) = [Cj, Zi ]+ = ( [Cj, Zi ]∗ i ≥ 0, [Σ i (Cj), Z0 ]∗ i < 0. It is not hard to check that this is a generalized cohomology theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 81</a>)</p>
So we get a generalized cohomology theory whenever we have an infinite loop space. (You may know that it works the other way around, too: every generalized cohomology comes from an infinite loop space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 81</a>)</p>
For us the importance of all of this is that by Bott’s theorem we have Z × BO ' Ω 8 ( Z × BO) ' Ω 16 ( Z × BO) ' . . . . Thus, Z × BO is an infinite loop space and the above machinery applies. We obtain a cohomology theory KO ∗ . Moreover, periodicity gives us that KO i+8 (X, A) ∼ = ∼ = KO i (X, A), for any i. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 81</a>)</p>
Let us try to compute KO( R P 2 ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 81</a>)</p>
The point of this section was to construct the cohomology theories KO and K, having the properties that when X is compact and Hausdorff the groups KO 0 (X) and K 0 (X) coincide with the Grothendieck groups of real and complex vector bundles over X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 81</a>)</p>
Next use the fact that R P 2 can be built by attaching a 2-cell to R P 1 = S 1 , where the attaching map wraps S 1 around itself twice. That is, R P 2 is the mapping cone for S 1 2 2 −→ S 1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 81</a>)</p>
g 0 (S 1 ) = KOst (S 1 ) corresponds We have previously seen that the generator of KO to the Mobius bundle [M ] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 82</a>)</p>
g (S 2 ) = KOst (S 2 ) is [O(1)], and the generator of KO the rank 2 bundle whose clutching map is the isomomorphism S 1 → SO(2). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 82</a>)</p>
We happen to know one bundle on RP 2 , the tautological line bundle γ. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 82</a>)</p>
We need g to decide if 2[γ] = 0 in KOst (RP 2 ); if it is, then KO g (RP KO 2 ) ∼ = (Z/2)2 and if it is g (RP not then KO ) 2 ∼ = Z/4. So the question becomes: is γ ⊕ γ stably trivial? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 82</a>)</p>
The answer turns out to be that γ ⊕ γ is not stably trivial; this is an elementary exercise using characteristic classes (Stiefel-Whitney classes), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 82</a>)</p>
Note that this calculation demonstrates an important principle to keep in mind: often the machinery of cohomology theories get you a long way, but not quite to the end, and one has to do some geometry to complete the calculation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 82</a>)</p>
Recall that [E] in KOst (RP 2 ) corresponds to [E] − rank(E) in KO g KO g (RP 2 ); so the class we wrote as [γ] is [γ] − 1 in the shifted perspective, and we need to decide if 2([γ] − 1) = 0 in KO(RP 2 ). The element 1 − [γ] should be thought of as corresponding to a chain complex of vector bundles 0 → γ → 1 → 0, and thinking of it this way one finds that it plays the role of the K-theoretic fundamental class of the submanifold RP 1 ,→ RP 2 . Then (1 − [γ])2 represents the self-intersection product of RP 1 inside RP 2 , which we know is a point by the standard geometric argument (shown in the picture below, depicting an RP 1 and a small perturbation of it)): (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 82</a>)</p>
For the moment just get the idea that it is the intersection theory of submanifolds in RP g (RP that is ultimately forcing KO 2 ) to be Z/4 rather than (Z/2)2 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 83</a>)</p>
Remark 13.12. It seems worth pointing out that in fact for every n one has n ) ∼ = Z/2k g (RP n ) ∼ KO = Z/2k for a certain value k depending on n.

Exercise 13.13. It is a good idea for the reader to try his or her hand at similar calculations, to see how the machinery is working. Try calculating some of the groups below, at least for small values of n: • K(CP n ) (reasonably easy) • KO(CP n ) (a little harder) • K(RP n ) (even harder) • KO(RP n ) (hardest).

It is a classical problem to determine how many independent vector fields one can construct on a given sphere S n . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 83</a>)</p>
This problem was heavily studied throughout the 1940s and 1950s, and then finally solved by Adams in 1962 using K-theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 83</a>)</p>
It is one of the great successes of generalized cohomology theories. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 83</a>)</p>
14.1. The vector field problem. Given a nonzero vector u = (x, y) in R 2 , there is a formula for producing a (nonzero) vector that is orthogonal to u: namely, (−y, x). However, there is no analog of this that works in R 3 . That is, there is no single formula that takes a vector in R 3 and produces a (nonzero) orthogonal vector. If such a formula existed then it would give a nonvanishing vector field on S 2 , and we know that such a thing does not exist by elementary topology. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 83</a>)</p>
Let us next consider what happens in R4 . Given u = (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ), we can produce an orthogonal vector via the formula (−x2 , x1 , −x4 , x3 ). But of course this (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 83</a>)</p>
is not the only way to accomplish this: we can vary what pairs of coordinates we choose to flip. In fact, if we consider  −x      2 −x3 −x4  x1   x4  −x3  v 1 =  −x4  , v2 =  x1  , v3 =  x2  .      −x 4  , v2 =  x1  , v3 =  x2       x 3 −x2 x1 then we find that v1 , v2 , and v3 are not only orthogonal to u but they are orthogonal to each other as well. In particular, at each point of S 3 we have given an orthogonal basis for the tangent space. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
Question 14.2. On S n , how many vectors fields v1 , v2 , . . . , vr can we find so that v 1 , v2 , . . . , vr are linearly independent for each x ∈ S n ? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
Note that by the Gram-Schmidt process we can replace “linearly independent” by “orthonormal.” If n is even, the answer is zero because there does not exist even a single nonvanishing vector field on an even sphere. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
Let u ∈ S 5 have the standard coordinates. We notice that the vector v1 = (−x 2 , x1 , −x4 , x3 , −x6 , x5 ) is orthogonal to v. However, a little legwork shows that no other pattern of switching coordinates will produce a vector that is orthogonal to both u and v1 . Of course this does not mean that there isn’t some more elaborate formula that would do the job, but it shows the limits of what we can do using our naive constructions. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
For v ∈ S 7 we can divide the coordinates into the top four and the bottom four. Take the construction that worked for S 3 and repeat it simultaneously in the top and bottom coordinates—this yields a set of three orthonormal vector fields on S 7 , given by the formulas (14.2) (−x2 , x1 , −x4 , x3 , −x6 , x5 , −x8 , x7 ), (−x 3 , x4 , x1 , −x2 , −x7 , x8 , x5 , −x6 ), (−x 4 , −x3 , x2 , x1 , −x8 , −x7 , x6 , x5 ). This idea generalizes at once to prove the following: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
Proposition 14.3. If there exist r (independent) vector fields on S n−1 , then there also exist r vector fields on S kn−1 for all k. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
For example, since there is one vector field on S 1 we also know that there is at least one vector field on S 2k−1 for every k. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
Likewise, since there are three vector fields on S 3 we know that there are at least three vector fields on S 4k−1 for every k. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
Recall that S 3 is a Lie group, being the unit quaternions inside of H. We can choose an orthonormal frame at the origin and then use the group structure to push this around to any point, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
hereby obtaining three independent vector fields; in other words, for any point x ∈ S 3 use the derivative of right-multiplication-by-x to transport our vectors in T 1 S 3 to Tx S 3 . The space S 7 is not quite a Lie group, but it still has a multiplication coming from being the set of unit octonions. The multiplication is not associative, but this is of no matter—the same argument works to construct 7 vector fields on S 7 . Note that this immediately gives us 7 vectors fields on S 15 , S 23 , etc. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=85" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 85</a>)</p>
Based on the data so far, one would naturally guess that if n = 2r then there are n − 1 vector fields on S n−1 . However, this guess turns out to fail already when n = 16 (and thereafter).

To give a sense of how the numbers grow, we give a chart showing the maximum number of vector fields known to exist on low-dimensional spheres: n 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 n−1 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 v.f. on S n−1 1 3 1 7 1 3 1 8 1 3 1 7 1 3 1 9 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=85" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 85</a>)</p>
Definition 14.4. If n = m · 2a+4b where m is odd, then the Hurwitz-Radon number for n is ρ(n) = 2a + 8b − 1. Theorem 14.5 (Hurwitz-Radon). There exist at least ρ(n) independent vector fields on S n−1 .

We will prove the Hurwitz-Radon theorem by a slick, modern method using Clifford algebras. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=85" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 85</a>)</p>
14.6. Sums-of-squares formulas. Hurwitz and Radon were not actually thinking about vector fields on spheres. They were instead considering an algebraic question about the existence of certain kinds of “composition formulas” for quadratic forms. For example, the following identity is easily checked: (x21 + x22 ) · (y12 + y22 ) = (x1 y1 − x2 y2 )2 + (x1 y2 + x2 y1 )2 . Hurwitz and Radon were looking for more formulas such as this one, for larger numbers of variables: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=85" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 85</a>)</p>
Definition 14.7. A sum-of-squares formulas of type [r, s, n] is an identity (x21 + x22 + . . . + x2r )(y12 + y22 + . . . + ys2 ) = z12 + z22 + . . . + zn2 in the polynomial ring R[x1 , . . . , xr , y1 , . . . , ys ], where each zi is a bilinear expression in x’s and y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=86" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 86</a>)</p>
We will often just refer to an “[r, s, n]-formula”, for brevity. For what values of r, s, and n does such a formula exist? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=86" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 86</a>)</p>
This is currently an open question. There are three formulas that are easily produced, coming from the normed algebras C, H, and O. The multiplication is a bilinear pairing, and the identity |xy|2 = |x|2 |y|2 is the required sums-of-squares formula. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=86" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 86</a>)</p>
Perhaps surprisingly, most of what is known about the non-existence of sumsof-squares formulas comes from topology. To phrase the question differently, we are looking for a function φ : R r ⊗ R s → R n such that |φ(x, y)|2 = |x|2 · |y|2 for all x ∈ R r and y ∈ R s . The bilinear expressions z1 , . . . , zn are just the coordinates of φ(x, y). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=86" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 86</a>)</p>
Corollary 14.9. If an [r, n, n]-formula exists, then there exist r − 1 independent vector fields on S n−1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=86" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 86</a>)</p>
Therefore we have established that φ(e2 , −), φ(e 3 , −), . . . , φ(er , −) are orthonormal vector fields on S n−1 .

14.10. Clifford algebras. We have seen that we get r − 1 independent vector fields on S n−1 if we have a sums-of-squares formula of type [r, n, n]. Having such a formula amounts to producing matrices A2 , A3 , . . . , Ar ∈ On such that A2i = −I and Ai Aj + Aj Ai = 0 for i 6= j. If we disregard the condition that the matrices be orthogonal, we can encoded the latter two conditions by saying that we have a representation of a certain algebra: Definition 14.11. The Clifford algebra Clk is defined to be the quotient of the tensor algebra Rhe1 , . . . , ek i by the relations e2i = −1 and ei ej + ej ei = 0 for all i 6= j. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 87</a>)</p>
The first few Clifford algebras are familiar: Cl0 = R, Cl1 = C, and Cl2 = H. After this things become less familiar: for example, it turns out that Cl3 = H × H (we will see why in just a moment). It is somewhat of a miracle that it is possible to write down a precise description of all of the Clifford algebras, and all of their modules. Before doing this, let us be clear about why we are doing it: Theorem 14.12. An [r, n, n]-formula exists if and only if there exists a Clr−1 module structure on R n . Consequently, if there is a Clr−1 -module structure on R n then there are r − 1 independent vector fields on S n−1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 87</a>)</p>
The collection of monomials e i 1 · · · eir for 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < · · · < ir ≤ k give a vector space basis for Clk , which has size 2k (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 87</a>)</p>
But a miracle now occurs, in that we can analyze all the Clifford algebras by a simple trick. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 88</a>)</p>
To do this part of the argument, we need a slight variant on our Clifford algebras. Given a real vector space V and a quadratic form q : V → R, define Cl(V, q) = TR (V )/hv ⊗ v = q(v) · 1 | v ∈ V i. For R with k q(x1 , . . . , xk ) = −(x21 + · · · + x2k ) this recovers the algebra Clk . For q(x 1 , . . . , xk ) = x21 + · · · + x2k this gives a new algebra we will call Cl − k .

14.17. Modules over Clifford algebras. Now that we know all the Clifford algebras, it is actually an easy process to determine all of their finitely-generated modules. We need three facts: • If A is a division algebra then all modules over A are free; • By Morita theory, the finitely-generated modules over A(n) are in bijective correspondence with the finitely-generated modules over A. The bijection sends an A-module M to the A(n)-module M n . • If R and S are algebras then modules over R × S can all be written as M × N where M is an R-module and N is an S-module (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=91" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 91</a>)</p>

Recall that if Clr−1 acts on R n then there are r − 1 independent vector fields on S n−1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=91" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 91</a>)</p>
Going down the rows of the above table, we make the following deductions: Cl 1 acts on R2 , therefore we have 1 vector field on S Cl 2 acts on R4 , therefore we have 2 vector field on S (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=91" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 91</a>)</p>
the smallest dimension of a nonzero module over Clr is 2σ(r) where σ(r) = #{s : 0 < s ≤ r and s ≡ 0, 1, 2, or 4 mod (8)} 2 σ(r) −1 −1 We know that we can construct r independent vector fields on S 2 .

We will eventually see, following [ABS], that there is a very direct connection between the groups KO∗ and the module theory of the Clifford algebras.

14.20. Adams’s Theorem. So far we have done all this work just to construct collections of independent vector fields on spheres. The Hurwitz-Radon lower bound is classical, and was probably well-known in the 1940’s. The natural question is, can one do any better? Is there a different construction that would yield more vector fields than we have managed to produce? People were actively working on this problem throughout the 1950’s. Adams finally proved in 1962 [Ad2] that the Hurwitz-Radon bound was maximal, and he did this by using K-theory: Theorem 14.21 (Adams). There do not exist ρ(n) + 1 independent vector fields on S n−1 .

Proposition 14.22. If there are r − 1 vector fields on S n−1 then the projection RP un−1 /RP un−r−1 → RP un−1 /RP un−2 ∼ = ∼ = S un−1 has a section in the homotopy 2k−2 2k−2 category, for every u > n . n (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 93</a>)</p>

Consider the map p 1 : Vk (Rn ) → S n−1 which sends (u1 , . . . , un ) 7→ u1 . There exist r vector fields on S n−1 if and only if there is a section of p1 : Vr+1 (Rn ) → S n−1 .

We need a fact from basic topology, namely that there is a cell structure on V k (Rn ) where the cells look like e i 1 × · · · × eis with n − k ≤ i1 < i2 < · · · < is ≤ n − 1 and s is arbitrary. We will not prove this here: see Hatcher [Ha, Section 3.D] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 93</a>)</p>

At this point we have seen that there exist cohomology theories K ∗ (−) and KO∗ (−). We have not proven their existence, but we have seen that their existence falls out as a consequence of the Bott periodicity theorems Ω2 (Z × BU ) ' Z × BU and Ω8 (Z × BO) ' Z × BO.

To some extent we have a “geometric” understanding of K 0 (−) and KO0 (−) in n terms of Grothendieck groups of vector bundles.

. One often hears a slogan like “The geometry behind K-theory lies in vector bundles”. This slogan, however, doesn’t really say very much; our aim will be to do better.

One way to encode geometry into a cohomology theory is via Thom classes for vector bundles. Such classes give rise to fundamental classes for submanifolds and a robust connection wth intersection theory.

Moreover, an orientation on R n determines a generator for H n (Rn , Rn − 0) ∼ = ∼ = Z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 94</a>)</p>
Now consider a vector bundle p : E → B of rank n. Let ζ : B → E be the zero section, and write E −0 as shorthand for E −im(ζ). For any x ∈ B let Fx = p−1 (x). n (Fx , Fx − 0) ∼ = Then H n (Fx , Fx − 0) ∼ = Z, and an orientation of the fiber gives a generator. We wish to consider the problem of giving compatible orientations for all the fibers at once; this can be addressed through the cohomology of the pair (E, E − 0). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 94</a>)</p>
Pick a generator UV ∈ H (EV , EV − 0) n ∼ = Z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 94</a>)</p>
For a neighborhood V of x, let EV = E|V = p−1 (V ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 94</a>)</p>
We think of UV as orienting all of the fibers simultaneously. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=95" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 95</a>)</p>
Definition 15.1. Given a rank n bundle E → B, a Thom class for E is an element UE ∈ H n (E, E − 0) such that for all x ∈ B, jx∗ (UE ) is a generator in H n (Fx , Fx − 0). (Here jx : Fx ,→ E is the inclusion of the fiber). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=95" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 95</a>)</p>
There is no guarantee that a bundle has a Thom class. Indeed, consider the following example: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=95" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 95</a>)</p>
If a bundle E → B has a Thom class then the bundle is called orientable. Said differently, an orientation on a vector bundle E → B is simply a choice of Thom class in H n (E, E − 0; Z). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=96" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 96</a>)</p>
One can also talk about Thom classes with respect to the cohomology theories H ∗ (−; R) for any ring R. Typically one only needs R = Z and R = Z/2, however. In the latter case, note that any n-dimensional real vector space V has a canonical orientation in H n (V, V − 0; Z/2). It follows that local Thom classes always patch together to give global Thom classes, and so every vector bundle has a Thom class ∗ in H ∗ (−; Z/2). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=96" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 96</a>)</p>
Finally, note that we can repeat all that we have done for complex vector spaces and complex vector bundles. However, a complex vector space V of dimension n has a canonical orientation on its underlying real vector space, and therefore a canonical generator in H 2n (V, V − 0). Just as in the last paragraph, this implies that local Thom classes always patch together to give global Thom classes; so every complex vector bundle has a Thom class. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=96" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 96</a>)</p>
Theorem 15.3. (a) Every complex bundle E → B of rank n has a Thom class in H 2n (E, E − 0). (b) Every real bundle E → B of rank n has a Thom class in H n (E, E − 0; Z/2). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=96" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 96</a>)</p>
Theorem 15.4 (Thom Isomorphism Theorem). Suppose that p : E → B has a Thom class UE ∈ H ∗ (E, E − 0). Then the map H ∗ (B) → H ∗ (E, E − 0) given by z 7→ p∗ (z) ∪ UE is an isomorphism of graded abelian groups that increases degrees by n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=96" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 96</a>)</p>
15.5. Thom spaces. The relative groups H ∗ (E, E − 0) coincide with the reduced cohomology groups of the mapping cone of the inclusion E − 0 ,→ E. This mapping cone is sometimes called the Thom space of the bundle E → B, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 97</a>)</p>
Definition 15.6. Suppose that E → B is a bundle with an inner product. Define the disk bundle of E as D(E) = {v ∈ E | hv, vi ≤ 1}, and the sphere bundle of E as S(E) = {v ∈ E | hv, vi = 1}. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 97</a>)</p>
This diagram shows that E − 0 ,→ E and S(E) ,→ D(E) have weakly equivalent mapping cones (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 97</a>)</p>
Unlike E −0 ,→ E, however, the map S(E) ,→ D(E) is a cofibration (under the mild condition that X is cofibrant, say): so the mapping cone is weakly equivalent to the quotient D(E)/S(E). This quotient is what is most commonly meant by the term ‘Thom space’: Definition 15.7. For a bundle E → B with inner product, the Thom space of E is Th E = D(E)/S(E). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 97</a>)</p>
Note that if B is compact then Th E is homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of the space E. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 97</a>)</p>
To see this it is useful to first compactify all the fibers separately, which amounts to forming the pushout of B ← S(E) → D(E). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 97</a>)</p>
k ) ∼ = RP n+k /RP n−1 Example 15.9. We will show that Th(nL → RP k ) ∼ = RP n+k /RP n−1 , where L is the tautological line bundle.

Proposition 15.13. For any real bundle E → X one has Th(E ⊕ n) ∼ = Σn Th(E). ∼ 2n = Σ For a complex bundle E → X one has Th(E ⊕ n) ∼ 2n = Σ Th(E).

15.12. Thom spaces for virtual bundles. Thom spaces behave in a very simple way in relation to adding on trivial bundles: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 99</a>)</p>
From this one readily sees that D(E ⊕ n)/S(E ⊕ n) ∼ = [D(E)/S(E)] ∧ [Dn /S n−1 ] ∼ = Th(E) ∧ S n (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 99</a>)</p>
Proposition 15.13 allows one to make sense of Thom spaces for virtual bundles, provided that we use spectra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 99</a>)</p>
these Thom spectra play a large role in modern algebraic topology. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 99</a>)</p>
15.14. An application to stunted projective spaces. To demonstrate the usefulness of Thom spaces we give an application to periodicities amongst stunted projective spaces. This material will be needed later, in the solution of the vector fields on spheres problem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 100</a>)</p>
The natural question arises: fixing a and b, what values of r (if any) satisfy Σ r [RP a+b /RP a ] ' RP a+b+r /RP a+r .

One can use singular cohomology and Steenrod operations to produce some necessary conditions here. For example, integral singular homology easily yields that if if b ≥ 2 then r must be even. Use of Steenrod operations produces more stringent conditions ( (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 100</a>)</p>
We will use Thom spaces to provide some sufficient conditions for a stable homotopy equivalence between stunted projective spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 100</a>)</p><hr># A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory, Miklos Bona/home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf## Notes<hr>## Highlights<hr># Abstract Algebra, I.

If M is a C 1 manifold, then associated to it is the differential algebra of C 1 forms. It is an algebra over R. The original theorem of deRham says that the cohomology of this differential algebra is naturally isomorphic (as a ring) to the singular cohomology with real coefficients. The connection between forms on singular cochains is once again achieved by integration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 97</a>)</p>

In this chapter, we shall study differential algebras in their own right. What we are doing, actually, is studying the homotopy theory of differential algebras.

This was solved in an abstract manner by Quillen, and in an attempt to better understand this, Sullivan was led to the p.l. forms and the connection between differential forms and homotopy type.

The commutative cochain problem. Perhaps the main genesis of the theory we are considering is the problem of commutative cochains.

one fundamental point was missing in that Whitney only constructs commutative cochains over R, and as already mentioned there is no way to build Postnikov towers over R and thus tie in the commutative cochains with homotopy type.

Moreover, a somewhat grizzly computation shows that on the cohomology level, we have graded commutativity (iii) Œ’p  [ Œ“q  D .1/pq Œ“q  [ Œ’p . However, it is obviously false that ’p [ “q D .1/pq “q [ ’p on the cochain level. Now one may attempt to modify the formula so as to have all three properties, but all such attempts are doomed to failure since, as realized by Steenrod 35 years ago, the failure to find commutative cochains over Z is reflected in the existence of cohomology operations, such as the Steenrod squares (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=102" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 102</a>)</p>

The problem of commutative cochains is equivalent to finding not only the cohomology but also the Q-homotopy type of a space from a cochain complex. The p.l. forms explicitly solve this problem, and moreover, a simple comparison theorem shows that the C 1 forms give the R-homotopy type of a smooth manifold.

for X to admit a Riemannian metric in which the wedge product of harmonic forms is harmonic, it must be the case that X is formal (over R).

This shows that such homotopy types are classified by equivalence classes of symmetric bilinear pairings (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=140" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 140</a>)</p>

That is to say, the rational homotopy category of simply connected spaces of finite type is isomorphic to the homotopy category of simply connected DGAs over Q with finite-dimensional cohomology in each degree, and the isomorphism between these rational homotopy categories is given by associating to a simplicial complex is p.l. forms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=154" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 154</a>)</p>
X. The fact that the chain complex Q.X/ computes the homology of X implies that this map is a weak homotopy equivalence; i.e., this map induces an isomorphism on the homology and homotopy groups.

Suppose that fW M ! B is a proper smooth submersion of smooth manifolds. Then fW M ! B is a smoothly locally trivial fibration.

Before Sullivan’s work on differential forms and rational homotopy theory, in [19] Quillen had established algebraic models for rational homotopy theory. Quillen worked dually from the way Sullivan does: Instead of using differential forms as the basic model, Quillen uses differential graded Lie algebras. One can, as Quillen does, associate a differential graded, co-commutative co-algebra to a differential graded Lie algebra. Dualizing this produces a differential graded algebra computing the rational homotopy type and thus in some sense solves the rational commutative cochain problem. Sullivan’s construction was much more directly tied to differential forms on the space, whereas Quillen’s went through more homotopy theoretic constructions, i.e., the simplicial set (of singular simplices) associated with the loop space of the given space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=168" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 168</a>)</p>
Definition. A graded Lie algebra (GLA) is a graded vector space L D ˚k Lk together with a homomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=168" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 168</a>)</p>

There are many variants of the bar construction. The one that is relevant for us here goes from a differential graded Lie algebra to a differential graded co-commutative, co-associative co-algebra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=170" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 170</a>)</p>
Theorem 17.1. Quillen assigns a reduced DGLA, .L.X/; @/, to a simply connected topological space X in a functorial way. Applying the bar construction to .L.X/; @/ produces a co-commutative differential graded co-algebra Q .X/. Dualizing this produces a DGA Q  .X/ functorially associated to X. Suppose that the rational homotopy groups of X in each degree are finite dimensional. If K is a simplicial complex and fW K ! X is a weak homotopy equivalence, then the minimal model MK for the p.l. forms A  .K/ and the minimal model MX for the DGA Q  .X/ are identified by a map determined up to homotopy by the homotopy class of f.

Some examples are in order: 1. A simplicial set (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=174" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 174</a>)</p>
The first and motivating example is that of the simplicial set of a topological space X. The simplicial set associated to X has Sn .X/ equal to the set of singular n-simplices of X, i.e., the set of continuous maps  n ! X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=174" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 174</a>)</p>
As we remarked above, the homotopy groups of a simplicial set K are easiest to define when the simplicial set satisfies is a Kan complex (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=174" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 174</a>)</p>
In general, to define the homotopy groups, one has to replace a simplicial set by an equivalent Kan complex, which can always be done. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=174" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 174</a>)</p>
Any simplicial group is a Kan complex, and therefore, we can directly define the homotopy groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=175" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 175</a>)</p>
Associated to a Lie algebra we have its Universal Enveloping Algebra which is a Hopf algebra, though the algebra structure is not commutative (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=176" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 176</a>)</p>
The Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem says that L embeds in its Universal Enveloping Algebra as the space of primitive elements (those satisfying .a/ D a˝1C1˝a). In fact, there is an equivalence of categories between Lie algebras and Hopf algebras (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=176" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 176</a>)</p>
The primary example for us comes from the rational group ring QG of a group G. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=177" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 177</a>)</p>
An element x is group-like if .x/ D x ˝ x. Group-like elements in a complete Hopf algebra are congruent to 1 modulo in the augmentation ideal (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)</p>
. To a topological space X, we associated the simplicial group G.X/ which is the analogue of the loop space applied to the simplicial set of (1-trivial) singular simplices in X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)</p>
Quillen passes from the category of reduced simplicial groups to the category of reduced simplicial Hopf algebras over Q that are complete with respect to the augmentation ideal. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)</p>
. This passage is the application of the simplicial functor to the b map that associates to a group the completion QG of the rational group ring QG with respect to the augmentation ideal. Since G0 D feg, the simplicial Hopf algebra with respect to the augmentation ideal (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)</p>
There is an adjoint to this functor that associates to a reduced, complete Hopf algebra its group of group-like elements (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)</p>
Lastly, we pass from a simplicial Lie algebra to a differential graded Lie algebra as follows (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)</p>
This then is Quillen’s functorial assignment of a DGLA to a simply connected topological space. As we have already remarked, we can apply the bar construction to pass from a DGLA to a co-commutative, co-associative co-algebra and then by duality to a DGA. The resulting DGA has the same minimal model as the p.l. forms on a simplicial complex homotopy equivalent to X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=179" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 179</a>)</p>
These developments began with A1 -spaces and A1 -structures in the 1960s and have been developed in the intervening years to what now goes under the name of the theory of operads (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=180" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 180</a>)</p>
intervening years to what now goes under the name of the theory of operads. One of the first results of this theory was Stasheff’s characterization [24] of those topological spaces that are homotopy equivalent to loop spaces as being A1 -spaces. (Indeed, an A1 -structure on a space determines the homotopy type of its classifying space, that is to say, its de-looping.)

These ideas, originating in homotopy theory, have also been crucial recently for developments in symplectic geometry, in particular in formulating the symplectic side of the mirror symmetry conjecture which originated in physics. One now formulates the appropriate object associated to a symplectic manifold as an A1 -category of Lagrangian submanifolds of the symplectic manifold, the Fukaya category (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=180" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 180</a>)</p>

Definition. Given an operad P D fPn g, the set X is an algebra over the operad if there is a morphism of operads from P ! End.X/. Said another way, for each pn 2 Pn determines a function f.pn /W Xn !

A space X is an algebra over the associahedron operad if there are continuous maps Kn  Xn ! X compatible with the structure maps of the operad. Said another way, End.X/ is naturally an operad of topological spaces and X is an algebra over the associahedron operad if there is a map of topological operads K ! End.X/. These objects are also called A1 -spaces.

Stasheff not only introduced the associahedra, he proved that an A1 -space X has a classifying space BX, so that an A1 -space is a loop space (up to homotopy equivalence).

There is an algebraic version of A1 -spaces called A1 -algebras. These algebras can be defined as algebras (in the category of graded vector spaces) over the operad in the induced category of differential graded vector spaces consisting of cellular chain complexes of the associahedra with the induced structure maps from the associahedra operad (thought of as an operad in the category of cell complexes and cellular maps).

The motivating example occurs in [6]. The objects formalized from what they did are called Fukaya categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=185" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 185</a>)</p>
The motivating example was to formalize the algebraic structure associated with the Lagrangian Floer homology of a symplectic manifold.

Given a symplectic manifold M, we form an A1 -category whose objects are Lagrangian submanifolds of M. For Lagrangian submanifolds L and L 0 by definition, Hom.L; L 0 / is the Floer cochain complex CF.L; L 0 /.

Under suitable hypotheses (see [20] for one such context), these structure maps produce an A1 -category structure, which is the Fukaya category of this symplectic manifold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=186" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 186</a>)</p>
To do this we introduce the graded-commutative analogue of A1 -algebras; see [10]. These are the so-called C1 -algebras. They are the quotient of A1 -algebras when one forces graded commutativity (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=186" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 186</a>)</p>

Let A  be a DGA. We can view this as a C1 -algebra with m1 D d, with m2 being the multiplication in the algebra, and with mi D 0 for all i > 2. We have the following theorem of Kadeishvili [10]. It says that up to homotopy equivalence, we can collapse A  onto its cohomology at the expense of endowing the cohomology with a possibly nontrivial C1 -structure.

There is an analogous theorem in the noncommutative case that says a (not necessarily commutative) DGA is equivalent in an appropriate homotopy category to an A1 -algebra structure on its cohomology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=188" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 188</a>)</p>

2 CHAPTER 1 WHERE PDEs COME FROM Some examples of PDEs (all of which occur in physical theory) are: 1. u x + u y = 0 (transport) 2. u x + yu y = 0 (transport) 3. u x + uu y = 0 (shock wave) 4. u x x + u yy = 0 (Laplace’s equation) 5. u tt − u x x + u 3 = 0 (wave with interaction) 6. u t + uu x + u x x x = 0 (dispersive wave) 7. u tt + u x x x x = 0 (vibrating bar) √ 8. u t − iux x = 0 (i = −1) (quantum mechanics) Each of these has two independent variables, written either as x and y or as x and t. Examples 1 to 3 have order one; 4, 5, and 8 have order two; 6 has order three; and 7 has order four. Examples 3, 5, and 6 are distinguished from the others in that they are not “linear.” We shall now explain this concept. Linearity means the following. Write the equation in the form lu = 0, where l is an operator. That is, if v is any function, lv is a new function. For instance, l = ∂/∂x is the operator that takes v into its partial derivative vx . In Example 2, the operator l is l = ∂/∂ x + y∂/∂ y. (lu = u x + yu y .) The definition we want for linearity is l(u + v) = lu + lv l(cu) = clu (3) for any functions u, v and any constant c. Whenever (3) holds (for all choices of u, v, and c), l is called linear operator. The equation lu = 0 (4) is called linear if l is a linear operator. Equation (4) is called a homogeneous linear equation. The equation lu = g, (5) where g = 0 is a given function of the independent variables, is called an inhomogeneous linear equation. For instance, the equation (cos x y 2 )u x − y 2 u y = tan(x 2 + y 2 ) (6) is an inhomogeneous linear equation. As you can easily verify, five of the eight equations above are linear as well as homogeneous. Example 5, on the other hand, is not linear because although (u + v)x x = u x x + vx x and (u + v)tt = u tt + vtt satisfy property (3), the cubic term does not: (u + v)3 = u 3 + 3u 2 v + 3uv 2 + v 3 = u 3 + v 3 . 2 CHAPTER 1 WHERE PDEs COME FROM Some examples of PDEs (all of which occur in physical theory) are: 1. u x + u y = 0 (transport) 2. u x + yu y = 0 (transport) 3. u x + uu y = 0 (shock wave) 4. u x x + u yy = 0 (Laplace’s equation) 5. u tt − u x x + u 3 = 0 (wave with interaction) 6. u t + uu x + u x x x = 0 (dispersive wave) 7. u tt + u x x x x = 0 (vibrating bar) √ 8. u t − iux x = 0 (i = −1) (quantum mechanics) Each of these has two independent variables, written either as x and y or as x and t.

1.1 WHAT IS A PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION? 3 The advantage of linearity for the equation lu = 0 is that if u and v are both solutions, so is (u + v). If u1 , . . . , un are all solutions, so is any linear combination  n c1 u 1 (x) + · · · + cn u n (x) = c j u j (x) (cj = constants). j=1 (This is sometimes called the superposition principle.) Another consequence of linearity is that if you add a homogeneous solution [a solution of (4)] to an inhomogeneous solution [a solution of (5)], you get an inhomogeneous solution. (Why?) The mathematical structure that deals with linear combinations and linear operators is the vector space. Exercises 5–10 are review problems on vector spaces. We’ll study, almost exclusively, linear systems with constant coefficients. Recall that for ODEs you get linear combinations. The coefficients are the arbitrary constants. For an ODE of order m, you get m arbitrary constants. Let’s look at some PDEs. Example 1. Find all u(x, y) satisfying the equation uxx = 0. Well, we can integrate once to get ux = constant. But that’s not really right since there’s another variable y. What we really get is ux (x, y) = f (y), where f (y) is arbitrary. Do it again to get u(x, y) = f (y)x + g(y). This is the solution formula. Note that there are two arbitrary functions in the solution. We see this as well in the next two examples.  Example 2. Solve the PDE u x x + u = 0. Again, it’s really an ODE with an extra variable y. We know how to solve the ODE, so the solution is u = f (y) cos x + g(y) sin x, where again f (y) and g(y) are two arbitrary functions of y. You can easily check this formula by differentiating twice to verify that u x x = −u.  Example 3. Solve the PDE uxy = 0. This isn’t too hard either. First let’s integrate in x, regarding y as fixed. So we get u y (x, y) = f (y). Next let’s integrate in y regarding x as fixed. We get the solution u(x, y) = F(y) + G(x), where F ′ = f.  1.1 WHAT IS A PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION? 3 The advantage of linearity for the equation lu = 0 is that if u and v are both solutions, so is (u + v).

1.1 WHAT IS A PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION? 3 The advantage of linearity for the equation lu = 0 is that if u and v are both solutions, so is (u + v).

Another consequence of linearity is that if you add a homogeneous solution [a solution of (4)] to an inhomogeneous solution [a solution of (5)], you get an inhomogeneous solution. (Why?) The mathematical structure that deals with linear combinations and linear operators is the vector space. Exercises 5–10 are review problems on vector spaces. We’ll study, almost exclusively, linear systems with constant coefficients. Recall that for ODEs you get linear combinations. The coefficients are the arbitrary constants. For an ODE of order m, you get m arbitrary constants. Let’s look at some PDEs. Example 1. Find all u(x, y) satisfying the equation uxx = 0. Well, we can integrate once to get ux = constant. But that’s not really right since there’s another variable y. What we really get is ux (x, y) = f (y), where f (y) is arbitrary. Do it again to get u(x, y) = f (y)x + g(y). This is the solution formula. Note that there are two arbitrary functions in the solution. We see this as well in the next two examples.  Example 2. Solve the PDE u x x + u = 0. Again, it’s really an ODE with an extra variable y. We know how to solve the ODE, so the solution is u = f (y) cos x + g(y) sin x, where again f (y) and g(y) are two arbitrary functions of y.

Definition The sequence of functions {fn : D ---+ IR} is said to be uniformly Cauchy, or {fn} is said to be uniformly Cauchy on D, provided that for each positive number E there is an index N such that lfn+k(x)fn(x)l < E (9.11) for every index n ~ N, every natural number k, and every point x in D.

A function f: I -+ JR, defined on an open interval, is called continuously differentiable provided that it is differentiable and its derivative is continuous.

Theorem 9.33 Let I be an open interval. Suppose that {fn: I -+ JR} is a sequence of continuously differentiable functions that has the following two properties: i. The sequence {fn} converges pointwise on I to the function f, and ii. The derived sequence {f~} converges uniformly on I to the function g. Then the function f :I -+ lR is continuously differentiable, and f'(x) = g(x) for all x in I.

The principal objective of this section is to show that if the function f : (r, r) -+ JR. is defined by the power series expansion for lxl < r, then f: (-r, r) -+ JR. is differentiable, and moreover, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=275" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 275</a>)</p>
The above computation is known as term-by-term differentiation of a series expansion (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=275" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 275</a>)</p>
The series .Z::~o ckxk is said to be convergen t uniformly on the set A provided that the sequence of partial sums {sn} converges uniformly on A to the function f.

Assume the following: There is a positive number M and a number a with 0 ~ a < 1 such that ~· for all indices k and all x in A . (9.30) Then the power series .Z::~o ckxk is uniformly convergent on A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=276" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 276</a>)</p>
However, the Weierstrass Uniform Convergence Criterion asserts that a sequence of functions converges uniformly if and only if the sequence is uniformly Cauchy (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=276" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 276</a>)</p>
Moreover, each of the power series and converges uniformly on the interval [ -r, r ] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=277" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 277</a>)</p>
Suppose that the nonzero number x 0 is in the domain of convergence of the power series 'E~o ckxk. Let r be any positive number less than lxo 1. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=277" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 277</a>)</p>
1. Then the interval [-r, r] is in the domain of convergence of the power series 'E~o ckxk and also in the domain of convergence of the derived power series (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=277" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 277</a>)</p>
The general result follows by induction since, according to Theorem 9 .40, the derived series of any power series that converges on ( -r, r) is another power series that also converges on ( -r, r). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=279" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 279</a>)</p>
Then the function f: (-r, r) --+ lR has derivatives of all orders (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=279" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 279</a>)</p>
Since the series 2:::~ 0 ckxk converges at each point between R and r, according to Theorem 9.40, each of the series and converges uniformly on the interval [R, R].

The above theorem implies that a function defined by a power series expansion on the interval ( -r, r) coincides with its Taylor series expansion about 0; this is a uniqueness result for the coefficients of a power series expansion (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=280" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 280</a>)</p>
Weierstrass presented the first example of a continuous function f : IR -+ IR that has the remarkable property that there is no point at which it is differentiable (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=283" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 283</a>)</p>
We will prove that the sequence of functions {fn} is uniformly Cauchy on IR. Once this is proven, it follows from the Weierstrass Uniform Convergence Criterion that {fn} converges uniformly on IR. Then, by Theorem 9.31, we can conclude that the limit function f, being the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions, is continuous (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Patrick Fitzpatrick/Advanced Calculus (613)/Advanced Calculus - Patrick Fitzpatrick (conflict 2019-03-21-22-26-47).pdf#page=283" target="_blank">Patrick Fitzpatrick 283</a>)</p><hr># More Concise Algebraic Topology: Localization, Completion, and Model Categories, J.

The only other preliminary that we require and that cannot be found in most of the books cited above is the Serre spectral sequence.

By far the longer of these parts is an introduction to model category theory. This material can easily be overemphasized, to the detriment of concrete results and the nuances needed to prove them. For example, its use would in no way simplify anything in the first half of the book. However, its use allows us to complete the first half by giving a conceptual construction and characterization of localizations and completions of general, not necessarily nilpotent, spaces.

we can dualize the proof of the first theorem below (as given for example in [89]) to prove the second. Theorem 0.0.1.

The argument is based on the dualization of cell complexes to cocell complexes, of which Postnikov towers are examples, and of the Homotopy Extension and Lifting Property (HELP) to co-HELP. Once this dualization is understood, it becomes almost transparent how one can construct and study the localizations and completions of nilpotent spaces simply by inductively localizing or completing their Postnikov towers one cocell at a time (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For conceptual clarity, we offer a slight reformulation of the original definition of a model category that focuses on weak factorization systems (WFS’s): a model category consists of a subcategory of weak equivalences together with a pair of related WFS’ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Colocalization is dual to Bousfield localization, and this brings us to another reason for our introduction to model category theory, namely a perceived need for as simple and accessible an approach to Bousfield localization as possible. This is such a centrally important tool in modern algebraic topology (and algebraic geometry) that every student should see it (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Under this assumption, bialgebras automatically have antipodes, so that there is no distinction between Hopf algebras and bialgebras. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

This allows us to define the homotopy category HoU simply by identifying homotopic maps; it is equivalent to the homotopy category of all spaces in U , not necessarily CW homotopy types, that is formed by formally inverting the weak homotopy equivalences.

The conventions mean that, when passing to homotopy categories, we implicitly approximate all spaces by weakly homotopy equivalent CW complexes, as we can do by [89, §10.3].

With k = Fp , such graded fields appear naturally in algebraic topology as the coefficients of certain generalized cohomology theories, called Morava Ktheories, and their homological algebra works exactly as for any other field, a fact that has real calculational applications (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

consider a Laurent series algebra k[x, x −1 ] over a field k, where x has positive even degree. To an algebraic topologist, this is a perfectly good graded field: every non-zero element is a unit.

In categorical language, the category Ab∗ of graded abelian groups is a symmetric monoidal category under ⊗, meaning that ⊗ is unital (with unit Z concentrated in degree 0), associative, and commutative up to coherent natural isomorphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For an algebraic topologist, the commutativity isomorphism γ : A ⊗ B −→ B ⊗ A is specified by γ(a ⊗ b) = (−1) pq b ⊗ a where deg(a) = p and deg(b) = q. A graded k-algebra with product φ is commutative if φ ◦ γ = φ; elementwise, this means that ab = (−1)pq ba (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

To an algebraic topologist, a polynomial algebra k[x] where x has odd degree is not a commutative k-algebra unless k has characteristic 2.

Proposition 1.4.3. For an H-space Y , the action of π1 (Y, ∗) on [X, Y ] is trivial and therefore [X, Y ] ∼ = ∼ = [X, Y ]free . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 1.4.4. Take X = S n in Definition 1.4.1. The definition then specializes to define an action of the group π1 (Y, ∗) on the group πn (Y, ∗). When n = 1, this is the conjugation action of π1 (Y, ∗) on itself. A (connected) space Y is simple if π1 (Y, ∗) is abelian and acts trivially on πn (Y, ∗) for all n ≥ 2.

As observed there, the sets [X, Y ] are groups if X is a suspension or Y is a loop space and are abelian groups if X is a double suspension or Y is a double loop space.

This is of greatest interest when Z = S 0 . Since [−, −] refers to based homotopy classes, [S 0 , X] = π0 (X) and the sequence becomes π1 (X) f ∗ / π1 (Y ) ι ∗ / π0 (F f ) p ∗ / π0 (X) f ∗ / π0 (Y ).

This specializes to give a group homomorphism π1 (B, b) −→ π0 (Aut(Fb )). Here Aut(Fb ) is the topological monoid of (unbased) homotopy equivalences of Fb . We think of π1 (B, b) as acting “up to homotopy” on the space Fb , meaning that an element β ∈ π1 (B, b) determines a well-defined homotopy class of homotopy equivalences Fb −→ Fb (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

(If p is a covering space, the action is by homeomorphisms, as in [89, p. 29].) As we shall use later, it follows that π1 (B) acts on the homology and cohomology groups of Fb .

Intuitively, homotopy colimits are constructed from ordinary categorical colimits by gluing in cylinders so as to give domains for homotopies that allow us to replace equalities between maps that appear in the specification of ordinary colimits by homotopies between maps (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Since homotopies between given maps are not unique, not even up to homotopy, homotopy colimits give weak colimits in the homotopy category, in the sense that they satisfy the existence but not the uniqueness property of ordinary colimits (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The equalizer E(α, β) of functions α, β : S −→ U is {s|α(s) = β(s)} ⊂ S, as we see by checking the universal property ([89, p. 16]).

The definition of lim1 Gi for an inverse sequence of abelian groups is given, for example, in [89, p. 146]. It generalizes to give a definition for not necessarily abelian groups.

Define a right action of the group G = ×i Gi on the set S = ×i Gi by (si ) ∗ (gi ) = (g −1 si γi (gi+1 )).

Warning 2.1.13. This is the original use of the term “phantom map”, but the name is also used in some, but by no means all, of the more recent literature for maps f : X −→ Z such f ◦ g is null homotopic for all maps g : W −→ X, where W is a finite CW complex (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The name comes from the fact that, with either definition, a phantom map f : X −→ Z induces the zero map on all homotopy, homology, and cohomology groups, since these invariants depend only on skeleta, and in fact only on composites f ◦ g, where g has finite domain (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The lim1 terms that appear in Propositions 2.1.9 and 2.2.9 are an essential, but inconvenient, part of algebraic topology. In practice, they are of little significance in most concrete applications, the principle reason being that they generally vanish on passage either to rationalization or to completion at any prime p, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We consider a sequence of homomorphisms γi : Gi+1 −→ Gi . For j > i, let γ = γi γi+1 · · · γj−1 : Gj −→ Gi and let Gj = im γ . We say that the sequence {Gi , γi } satisfies the Mittag–Leffler condition if for each i there exists j(i) such that Gki i = G j(i) i for all k > j(i). That is, these sequences of images eventually stabilize. For example, this condition clearly holds if each γi is an epimorphism or if each Gi is a finite group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The main conclusion is that either the Mittag–Leffler condition holds and lim1 Gi = 0 or, under further hypotheses that usually hold in the situations encountered in algebraic topology, the Mittag–Leffler condition fails and lim1 Gi is uncountable (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proof. Using mapping cylinders, we can replace f by a cofibration [89, p. 42]. Since weak equivalences induce isomorphisms on homology and cohomology, relative CW approximation [89, p. 76] and cellular approximation of maps [89, p. 74] show that we can replace X and Y by CW complexes with the same q-skeleton and can replace f by a cellular map that is the identity on the q-skeleton. Since in dimensions less than q the cellular chains and thus the homology and cohomology groups of a CW complex depend only on its q-skeleton, the conclusion follows.

On the other hand, when G is abelian, a π-group is just a module over the group ring Z[π]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Clearly simple spaces and, in particular, simply connected spaces, are nilpotent. Connected H-spaces are simple and are therefore nilpotent. While it might seem preferable to restrict attention to simple or simply connected spaces, nilpotent spaces have significantly better closure properties under various operations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We can always construct maps αn : X −→ Xn such that αn induces an isomorphism on πi for i ≤ n and πi Xn = 0 for i > n just by attaching cells inductively to kill the homotopy groups of X in dimension greater than n.

When X is simple, and only then, we can arrange further that Xn+1 is the homotopy fiber of a “k-invariant” k n+2 : Xn −→ K(πn+1 X, n + 2). This is what it means for X to have a “Postnikov tower of principal fibrations”. The name comes from the fact that Xn+1 is then the pullback along k n+2 of the path space fibration over K(πn+1 X, n + 2). Of course, the fiber of the resulting map pn+1 : Xn+1 −→ Xn is an Eilenberg-MacLane space K(πn+1 X, n + 1). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

One then constructs k n+2 by killing the higher homotopy groups of the cofiber Cαn and defines Xn+1 to be the fiber of k n+2 .

Since right adjoints, such as P (−) or, more generally, F (X, −), preserve all categorical limits and since limits, such as pullbacks and sequential limits, commute with other limits, we find easily that products, pullbacks, and sequential limits of K -towers are again K -towers.

The circle S 1 is a K(Z, 1). Our first example of a localized space is ST1 T1 , which not surprisingly turns out to be K(ZT , 1). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Finally, consider A = Z, so that AT = ZT . The circle S 1 is a K(Z, 1). Our first example of a localized space is ST1 T1 , which not surprisingly turns out to be K(ZT , 1). AT can be constructed as the colimit of copies of Z together with the maps induced by multiplication by the primes not in T . For example, if we order the primes qi not in T by size and define rn inductively by r1 = q1 and rn = rn−1 q1 · · · qn = q1n . . . qn , then ZT is the colimit over n of the maps rn : Z −→ Z. We can realize these maps on π1 (S 1 ) by using the rn th power map S 1 −→ S 1 . Using the telescope construction ([89, p. 113]) to convert these multiplication maps into inclusions and passing to colimits, we obtain a space K(ZT , 1); the van Kampen theorem gives that the colimit has fundamental group ZT , and the higher homotopy groups are zero because a map from S n into the colimit has image in a finite stage of the telescope, which is equivalent to S 1 . The commutation of homology with colimits gives that the only non-zero reduced integral homology group of K(ZT , 1) is its first, which is ZT . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In fact, as we shall use heavily in §5.4, for any groups G and H, not necessarily abelian, passage to fundamental groups induces a bijection (5.1.5) [K(G, 1), K(H, 1)] ∼ = ∼ Hom(G, H). = (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

One way to see this is to observe that the classifying space functor from groups to Eilenberg–Mac Lane spaces (e.g. [89, p. 126]) gives an inverse bijection to π1 , but it can also be verified directly from the elementary construction of K(G, 1)’s that is obtained by realizing π1 as the fundamental group of a space X ([89, p. 35]) and then killing the higher homotopy groups of X.

Proposition 5.2.7.

Recall that localization commutes with finite products. It does not commute with infinite products in general, but we have the following observation. Lemma 5.5.6.

We give several characterizations of localizations in §6.1, and we use these to study the homotopical behavior of localization with respect to standard constructions on based spaces in (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Using the homological characterization of localizations, we obtain analogues of the results in §6.2 for wedges, suspensions, cofiber sequences, and smash products. However, in the non-simply connected case, the required preservation of nilpotency is not automatic. Wedges behave badly, for example. The wedge S 1 ∨ S 1 is not nilpotent since a free group on two generators is not nilpotent, and the wedge S 1 ∨S 2 is not nilpotent since π1 does not act nilpotently on π2 .

Proposition 6.6.2. If Y is an H-space with product µ, then YT is an H-space with product µT such that the localization φ : Y −→ YT is a map of H-spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The converse does not hold. There are many interesting spaces that are not H-spaces but have localizations that are H-spaces. In fact, in 1960, well before localizations were constructed in general, Adams [2] observed that STn Tn is an Hspace for all odd n and all sets T of odd primes.

In contrast, S n itself is an H-space only if n = 0, 1, 3, or 7, by Adams’ solution to the Hopf invariant one problem [1]. Here the Lie group S 3 is not homotopy commutative and the H-space S 7 given by the unit Cayley numbers is not homotopy associative (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The study breaks into two main variants. In one of them, one allows general finite T -local H-spaces, not necessarily homotopy associative or commutative, and asks what possible underlying homotopy types they might have. In the other, one studies finite T -local loop spaces, namely spaces X that are of the homotopy type of finite T -CW complexes and are also homotopy equivalent to ΩBX for some T -local space BX. Such X arise as localizations of finite loop spaces. One asks, typically, how closely such spaces resemble compact Lie groups and what limitations the H-space structure forces on the homology and homotopy groups. The structure theorems for Hopf algebras that we give later provide a key starting point for answering such questions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Many results in algebraic topology that preceded the theory of localization are conveniently proven using the newer theory. We illustrate this with a proof of a basic theorem of Serre on the finiteness of the homotopy groups of spheres. Serre proved the result using (Serre) classes of abelian groups [121]. The proof using rationalization is simpler and more illuminating. Theorem 6.7.1 (Serre). For n ≥ 1, the homotopy groups πq (S n ) are finite with the exceptions of πn (S n ) = Z for all n and π2n−1 (S n ) = Z ⊕ Fn for n even, where Fn is finite.

Proposition 6.7.2. The cohomology algebra H ∗ (K(Q, n); Q) is the exterior algebra on ιn if n is odd and the polynomial algebra on ιn if n is even. Proof. For n = 1 and n = 2, this is clear from Theorem 5.2.8 and the fact that S 1 = K(Z, 1) and CP ∞ = K(Z, 2). We proceed by induction on n, using the Serre spectral sequence of the path space fibration K(Q, n) −→ P K(Q, n + 1) −→ K(Q, n + 1). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

and the spectral sequence is concentrated on the 0th and nth rows. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Thus the rationalization of the homotopy group πq (S n ), q > 0, is 0 if q 6= 2n − 1 and is Q if q = 2n − 1. Since π2n−1 (S n ) is a finitely generated abelian group with rationalization Q, it must be the direct sum of Z and a finite group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

This implies that all homotopy groups πq (S n ), q > n, are in the kernel of rationalization. That is, they are torsion groups. Since they are finitely generated by Theorem 4.5.7, they are finite.

In Chapter 5, we described how to construct localizations of nilpotent spaces.

I might be the positive integers and Ti might be the set consisting of just the ith prime number pi . A common situation is when I = {1, 2}, T1 = {p}, and T2 is the set of all other primes.

It says that to check whether or not two maps are homotopic, it suffices to check whether or not they become homotopic after localization at each prime p.

Recall too that Proposition 2.2.2 and Corollary 2.2.3 tell us how to compute the homotopy groups of homotopy pullbacks (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remark 8.3.7. We repeat Remark 7.2.2, since it applies verbatim here. Theorem 8.1.3 was proven under a finite generation hypothesis in Hilton, Mislin, and Roitberg [60], and Hilton and Mislin later noticed that the hypothesis can be removed [59]. That fact is not as well-known as it should be. We learned both it and most of the elegant proof presented here from Bousfield. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Much early work in the theory of localization focused on the concept of genus, which was introduced by Mislin [102] in the context of H-spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Having the homotopy type of a finite CW complex is not a generic property, by a counterexample of Mislin [103]. Being of the homotopy type of a space with finitely generated integral homology is generic (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 8.5.8. The genus of HP ∞ is uncountably infinite. For comparison, McGibbon [96] computed the genus of the finite nilpotent projective spaces RP 2n+1 , CP n and HP n for 1 ≤ n < ∞. For these spaces X, he uses pullbacks over X to give the set G(X) a group structure and proves the following result. Theorem 8.5.9. Let n be a positive integer. (i) G(RP 2n+1 ) = 1, (ii) G(CP n ) = 1, (iii) G(HP n ) ∼ = Z/2 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Z/2, where the number of factors equals the number of primes p such that 2 ≤ p ≤ 2n − 1.

As in the case of nilpotent groups, asking how unique formal localizations are gives a starting point of the analysis of the extended genus, and one can then seek the actual genus inside that (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Rather tautologically, a major theme of algebraic topology is the algebraization of homotopy theory. In some cases, the algebraization is complete, and this is true for rational homotopy theory, as proven by Quillen [110] and Sullivan [130 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

we show how to give it more topological content via the Samelson product on homotopy groups.

This leads to an all too brief discussion of Whitehead products, which are the starting point for serious work in unstable homotopy theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 9.1.3.

recall from [89, p. 127] that Eilenberg– Mac Lane spaces can be constructed as commutative topological groups. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 9.2.1. An H-monoid is a homotopy associative H-space. An Hgroup is an H-monoid with a map χ providing inverses up to homotopy, so that µ ◦ (id ×χ) ◦ ∆ ≃ ∗ ≃ µ ◦ (χ × id) ◦ ∆, where ∗ denotes the trivial map at the unit element e and µ is the product (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 149</a>)</p>
If we abuse notation by writing χ(x) = x −1 and writing µ(x, y) = xy, then the condition becomes “xx −1 = e = x −1 x” up to homotopy. An H-monoid is grouplike if π0 (X) is a group under the product induced by the product on X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

More elegantly, an H-space X is an H-monoid if the functor [−, X] is monoid– valued and is an H-group if the functor [−, X] is group–valued (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

This raises the question of whether or not there is a homotopical construction of a Lie bracket on π∗ (X) for an H-group X that is compatible under the Hurewicz homomorphism with the commutator in H∗ (X; Z). The answer is that indeed there is. The relevant product on homotopy groups is called the Samelson product (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 9.2.5. Let X be a connected H-group of finite type. Then H∗ (X; Q) is isomorphic as a Hopf algebra to U (π∗ (X) ⊗ Q), where π∗ (X) is regarded as a Lie algebra under the Samelson product.

by hf, gi = [φ′ ◦(f ∧g)]. Specializing to J = S p and K = S q , this gives the Samelson product h−, −i : πp (X) ⊗ πq (X) −→ πp+q (X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We rewrite this as [−, −] : [ΣJ, X] ⊗ [ΣK, X] −→ [Σ(J ∧ K), X] and call it the generalized Whitehead product.

From this point of view, the Whitehead product [ip , iq ] is thought of as a map S p+q−1 −→ S p ∨ S q , and it is the attaching map for the construction of S p × S q from S p ∨ S q .

Thinking of spaces, homotopy types, and spaces in the same genus as analogous to animals, animals in the same species, and animals in the same genus, algebraic topologists are expert at genetic modification to produce different species in the same genus.

We usually modify spaces using finite sets I, especially partitions of the primes into two disjoint sets T1 and T2 .

They constructed an H-space X that is in the same genus as the Lie group Sp(2) but is not equivalent to it. Both X and Sp(2) are equivalent to S 3 × S 7 away from the primes 2 and 3. As is explained in [60, pp. 122-127], the three H-spaces in sight, X, Sp(2) and S 3 × S 7 , are total spaces of bundles over S 7 with fiber S 3 , and every simply connected finite H-space with rational cohomology E[x3 , x7 ] is equivalent to the total space of such a bundle.

It is usual to focus on a single prime p, and there is no loss of information in doing so since completion at T is the product over p ∈ T of the completions at p, and similarly for all relevant algebraic invariants (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

.1.1. p-adic completion.

This definition will not fully serve our purposes since p-adic completion is neither left nor right exact in general, and exactness properties are essential to connect up with the topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

When A = Z, we write Zp instead of Z Ẑ Ẑp for the ring of p-adic integers, and we abbreviate Z/nZ to Z/n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Even if we restrict to finitely generated abelian groups, we notice one key point of difference between localization and completion. While a homomorphism of abelian groups between p-local groups is necessarily a map of Z(p) -modules, a homomorphism of abelian groups between p-adically complete abelian groups need not be a map of Zp -modules.

When A is finitely generated, p-adic completion is given by the map ψ : A −→ A⊗Zp specified by ψ(a) = a ⊗ 1, this again being a consequence of the Artin-Rees lemma (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

To overcome the lack of exactness of p-adic completion in general, we consider the left derived functors of the p-adic completion functor. For the knowledgable reader, we recall that left derived functors are usually defined only for right exact functors, in which case the 0th left derived functor agrees with the given functor (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The left derived functors of p-adic completion are given on an abelian group A by first taking a free resolution 0 −→ F ′ −→ F −→ A −→ 0 of A, then applying p-adic completion, and finally taking the homology of the resulting length two chain complex ̂p F̂ ′ p′ −→ ̂ F̂p (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma 10.1.4. The functors L0 and L1 take values in Zp -modules.

Definition 10.1.5. Fix a prime p. We say that the completion of A at p is defined if L1 A = 0, and we then define the completion of A at p to be the homomorphism φ : A −→ L0 A.

The group ̂ F̂p /F is uniquely p-divisible.

In view of Example 10.1.14, we have an interesting explicit example where homotopy groups shift dimension. Example 10.3.3.

One might naively hope that, at least if X is f -nilpotent, ̃ H̃∗ ( ̂ X̂T ; Z) might be isomorphic to ̃ H̃∗ (X; Z) ⊗ Z Ẑ ẐT , in analogy with what is true for localization.

The problem is that, while the kernel and cokernel of a map of Zp modules between p-complete abelian groups are Zp -modules, they still need not be p-complete (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

However, using the characterization of completion in terms of mod p homology, we can obtain correct statements simply by completing the constructions that fail to be complete.

There is a large body of interesting work on p-complete H-spaces.

Of course, this holds for any topological group G, since G is equivalent to the loops on its classifying space BG. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

This notion was introduced and studied by Dwyer and Wilkerson [41], who showed how remarkably similar to compact Lie groups these X are. The completion of a compact Lie group is an example, but there are many others. Like compact Lie groups, p-compact groups have versions of maximal tori, normalizers of maximal tori, and Weyl groups. A complete classification, analogous to the classification of compact Lie groups, has recently been obtained (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The compatibility condition involves a notion of formal completion, and we also give a brief discussion of the what we call the adèlic genus of a nilpotent group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

. Conceptually, the point is that the group theory knows only about Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces K(G, 1), but the topology knows how to use two-stage Postnikov towers to construct completions of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces K(G, 1) for nilpotent groups G that are not completable algebraically (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We begin by showing that completion preserves certain pullbacks. This is in contrast to the case of localization, where all pullbacks are preserved. Of course, the difference is a consequence of the failure of exactness for completion (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Lemma 12.2.1. If an abelian group A is completable at T , then the kernel of the completion φ̂ φ̂ : A → ET A is Hom(Z[T −1 ], A).

It is natural to think of completion at p as the composite of localization at p and completion at p (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Our algebraic local to global result reads as follows. Its hypotheses seem to be minimal, but it is instructive to compare it with Theorem 13.3.1, where the topology allows us to generalize to groups that are not completable at T .

We first develop conditions on the input that ensure that our local to global fracture theorem delivers f Ẑ ẐT -nilpotent groups as output. This is subtle since finite generation conditions on the input are not always sufficient. There are finitely generated T -complete groups that cannot be realized as the completions of finitely generated T -local groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 12.4.6. The adèlic genus of a finitely generated nilpotent group G is the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated nilpotent groups G ′ such that G0 is isomorphic to G′ ′0 ′0 and ̂ Ĝp is isomorphic to ̂ Ĝ′ ′p ′p for all primes p. The complete genus of G is defined by dropping the requirement that G0 be isomorphic to G′ 0 0 . The name “adèlic” is suggested by Sullivan’s analogy [131, 129] with the theory of adèles in number theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The conclusion would be that the adèlic genus of G is in bijective correspondence with the double cosets Aut H\ Aut (J0 )/ Aut J (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The following general observation is elementary but important. It helps explain why one should expect to be able to reconstruct T -local spaces from their rationalizations and their completions at T . Lemma 13.2.1. Let f : X −→ Y be any map. Then f∗ : H∗ (X; ZT ) −→ H∗ (Y ; ZT ) is an isomorphism if and only if f∗ : H∗ (X; Q) −→ H∗ (Y ; Q) and, for all p ∈ T , f∗ : H∗ (X; Fp ) −→ H∗ (Y ; Fp ) are isomorphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Indeed, homology commutes with sums and colimits of coefficient groups since this already holds on the chain level. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We saw in §12.4 that the lack of a functorial formal completion of nilpotent groups impeded the naive analysis of the complete genus of f -nilpotent groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The idea is to form the tensor product of a space X and a ring R to obtain a space “X ⊗R” such that π∗ (X ⊗R) is naturally isomorphic to π∗ (X)⊗R. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Since we want tensoring over R to be an exact functor on abelian groups, we also insist that the underlying abelian group of R be torsion free. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

For any set of primes S ⊂ T , the localization of X at S can be thought of as X ⊗ ZS and the completion of X at S can be thought of as X ⊗ Ẑ ẐS . We didn’t need the finite type hypothesis to conclude that π∗ (XS ) ∼ = ∼ = π∗ (X) ⊗ ZS , but we did need it to conclude that π∗ ( ̂ X̂S ) ∼ = ∼ = π∗ (X) ⊗ Ẑ ẐS . In both cases, with our X ⊗ R notation, we started with K(A, n) ⊗ R = K(A ⊗ R, n) and inducted up the Postnikov tower of X to obtain the construction. We explain how the same construction goes in our more general situation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The difficulty is that, in this generality, the cohomology of the EilenbergMac Lane spaces K(B ⊗ R, n) can be quite badly behaved.

Definition 13.6.5. The adèlic genus of an f -nilpotent space X is the set of homotopy classes of f -nilpotent spaces Y such that X0 is equivalent to Y0 and X ̂ X̂p is isomorphic to Y ̂ Ŷp for all primes p. The complete genus of X is defined by dropping the requirement that X0 be isomorphic to Y0 . Write ̂ Ĝ0 (X) for the adèlic genus of X and ̂ Ĝ(X) for the complete genus. Recall that G(X) denotes the (local) genus of X. If two spaces are in the same local genus, they are in the same adèlic genus, and if two spaces are in the same adèlic genus they are in the same complete genus. Therefore we have inclusions G(X) ⊂ G ̂ Ĝ0 (X) ⊂ G ̂ Ĝ(X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 13.6.6. For a simple space X of finite type, there is a canonical bijection between ̂ Ĝ0 (X) and the set of double cosets hAut(X0 )\hAut(F X0 )/hAut(F X).

Theorem 13.6.7. If X is a simply connected finite CW complex, then ̂ Ĝ(X) and therefore ̂ Ĝ0 (X) and G(X) are finite sets. It is natural to ask if these three notions of genus are genuinely different (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Recall that the function space F (X, Y ) is nilpotent when X is finite and Y is of finite type (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Taking Y = X, this suggests that the automorphism groups above should be nilpotent, or nearly so, when X is finite and that their analysis should be closely related to the algebraic analysis of the genus of a finitely generated nilpotent group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem 13.6.8. Let X be an f -nilpotent space. If X0 admits an H-space structure, then ̂ Ĝ0 (X) = ̂ Ĝ(X). If, further, X is either π∗ -finite or H∗ -finite, then G(X) = ̂ Ĝ(X). However, there are simply connected examples such that ̂ Ĝ0 (X) 6= ̂ Ĝ(X), and these can be chosen to be π∗ -finite or H∗ -finite. Similarly, there are simply connected examples such that G(X) 6= ̂ Ĝ0 (X), and these too can be chosen to be π∗ -finite or H∗ -finite (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Say that X is π∗ -finite or H∗ -finite if it has only finitely many non-zero homotopy groups or only finitely many non-zero homology groups, all of them assumed to be finitely generated (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Model category theory is due to Quillen [112]. Nice introductions are given in [40, 51], and there are two expository books on the subject [63, 64] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In fact, by now the very term “homotopy theory” admits of two interpretations. There is the homotopy theory of topological spaces, which is the core of algebraic topology, and there is also homotopy theory as a general methodology applicable to many other subjects (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let M be a category. We insist that categories have sets of morphisms between pairs of objects; category theorists would say that M is locally small.

meaning that they are defined with (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=213" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 213</a>)</p>
respect to functors out of small categories D. We assume once and for all that M is bicomplete. This means that M is complete (has all limits) and cocomplete (has all colimits). In particular, it has an initial object ∅ and a terminal object ∗ (the coproduct and product of the empty set of objects). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

A model structure on M consists of three interrelated classes of maps (W , C , F ), called the weak equivalences, the cofibrations, and the fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

homotopy category HoM that is obtained by inverting the weak equivalences. This is a localization process that is analogous to the localization of rings at multiplicatively closed subsets, and it is characterized by an analogous universal property. Formally, this means that there must be a functor γ : M −→ HoM such that γ(w) is an isomorphism if w ∈ W and γ is initial with respect to this property.

One might attempt to construct HoM by means of words in the morphisms of M and formal inverses of the morphisms of W , but the result of such a construction is not locally small in general (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The following observation is often applied to classical homotopy categories, where it shows that a retract of a homotopy equivalence is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

there can be many model structures on M with the same weak equivalences. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Transfinite colimits play a substantial role in the foundational literature of model category theory, and they are crucial to the construction of Bousfield localizations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 14.1.7. Let L be a class of maps in M . We say that L is left saturated if the following (redundant) closure properties hold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 14.1.10. An ordered pair (L , R) of classes of morphisms of M factors M if every morphism f : X −→ Y factors as a composite X i(f ) / Z(f ) p(f ) /Y with i(f ) ∈ L and p(f ) ∈ R.

Mapping cylinders and mapping path fibrations [89, pp 43, 48] give the original source for the following idea, but it also arises from analogous categorical contexts. Definition 14.1.11. A weak factorization system (WFS) of M is an ordered pair (L , R) of classes of morphisms of M that factors M and satisfies both L = R and R = L  (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 217</a>)</p>
The required equalities say that the maps in L are precisely the maps that have the LLP with respect to the maps in R and the maps in R are precisely the maps that have the RLP with respect to the maps in L .

Ponto 217</a>)</p>
Category theorists also study strong factorization systems, for which the relevant lifts λ are required to be unique. 3 The difference is analogous to the difference between the class of fibrations and the class of covering maps as the choice of R.

Definition 14.2.1. A model structure on M consists of classes (W , C , F ) of morphisms of M , the weak equivalences, cofibrations, and fibrations, such that (i) W has the two out of three property. (ii) (C , F ∩ W ) is a (functorial) weak factorization system. (iii) (C ∩ W , F ) is a (functorial) weak factorization system. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 218</a>)</p>
The maps in F ∩ W are called acyclic (or trivial) fibrations; those in C ∩ W are called acyclic (or trivial) cofibrations. The definition requires every map to factor both as the composite of a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration and as an acyclic cofibration followed by a fibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 218</a>)</p>
It also requires there to be a lift in any commutative square A i  E p  X > ~> ~ ~ ~ /B in which i is a cofibration, p is a fibration, and either i or p is acyclic (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 218</a>)</p>
By (14.2.2) and (14.2.3, to specify a model structure on a category with a chosen class of weak equivalences that satisfies the two out of three property, we need only specify either the cofibrations or the fibrations, not both (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

(14.2.4) C  (F ∩ W ) and F  (C ∩ W ). It is usual to define model categories by requiring (14.2.4) and requiring F , C , and W to be closed under retracts. The following observation (due to Joyal) shows that our axioms imply that W is closed under retracts and are therefore equivalent to the usual ones (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 219</a>)</p>
Lemma 14.2.5. The class W as well as the classes C , C ∩ W , F , and F ∩ W in a model structure are subcategories that contain all isomorphisms and are closed under retracts. Therefore W is a subcategory of weak equivalences in the sense of Definition 14.1.4. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 14.2.7. An object X of a model category M is cofibrant if the unique map ∅ −→ X is a cofibration. An acyclic fibration q : QX −→ X in which QX is cofibrant is called a cofibrant approximation or cofibrant replacement 5 of X. We can obtain q by factoring ∅ −→ X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 220</a>)</p>
Given two cofibrant replacements q : QX −→ X and q ′ : Q′ X −→ X, the lifting property gives a weak equivalence ξ : QX −→ Q′ X such that q ′ ◦ ξ = q (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 221</a>)</p>
In many model categories, either all objects are fibrant or all objects are cofibrant (but rarely both). For example, all objects are fibrant in the model structures that we shall define on U , and all objects are cofibrant in the usual model structure on simplicial sets (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 221</a>)</p>
For example, the following result becomes especially helpful when all objects are cofibrant or all objects are fibrant. Lemma 14.2.9 (Ken Brown’s lemma). Let F : M −→ N be a functor, where M is a model category and N is a category with a subcategory of weak equivalences. If F takes acyclic cofibrations between cofibrant objects to weak equivalences, then F takes all weak equivalences between cofibrant objects to weak equivalences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

in most examples there is a familiar and classical notion of a homotopy between maps. It is defined in terms of canonical cylinder and path objects, such as X × I and Map(I, X) in the case of spaces. Quillen [112] developed a notion of homotopy in general model categories and showed how to derive many familiar results using the model theoretic notion.

objects (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=222" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 222</a>)</p>
Definition 14.3.1. A cylinder object for X ∈ M is an object Cyl X together with maps i0 : X −→ Cyl X, i1 : X −→ Cyl X, and p : Cyl (X) −→ X such that p ◦ i0 = id = p ◦ i1 and p is a weak equivalence; by the two out of three property, i0 and i1 are also weak equivalences. A cylinder object is good if the map i = i0 + i1 : X ∐ X −→ Cyl (X) is a cofibration. A good cylinder object Cyl (X) is very good if p is an acyclic fibration. Factorization of the folding map X ∐ X −→ X shows that every X has at least one very good cylinder object. A left homotopy between maps f, g : X −→ Y is a map h : Cyl (X) −→ Y such that h ◦ i0 = f and (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

◦ i1 = g, where Cyl (X) is any cylinder object for X; h is good or very good if Cyl (X) is good or very good. Define π ℓ (X, Y ) to be the set of equivalence classes of maps X −→ Y under the equivalence relation generated by left homotopy (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Lemma 14.3.3. If h is a left homotopy from f to g and either f or g is a weak equivalence, then so is the other. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 223</a>)</p>
We emphasize that the definition of left homotopy allows the use of any cylinder object and that the notion of left homotopy and its good and very good variants are not equivalence relations in general (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Even in some categories with canonical cylinders, such as the category of simplicial sets, homotopy is not an equivalence relation in general (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

For example, in the standard model structure on topological spaces of §17.2, X × I is a cylinder object, but it is not good unless X is cofibrant, and similarly for categories of chain complexes.

Lemma 14.3.7 (HEP). Let i : A −→ X be a cofibration and Y be a fibrant object. Then i satisfies the right homotopy extension property with respect to Y .

Perhaps the real force of Quillen’s approach to homotopies is the comparison between left and right homotopies. Proposition 14.3.11. Consider maps f, g : X −→ Y .

Definition 14.3.12. When X is cofibrant and Y is fibrant, we say that f is homotopic to g, written f ≃ g, if f is left or, equivalently, right homotopic to g.

Corollary 14.3.13. Let X be cofibrant and Y be fibrant. Fix a good cylinder object Cyl X and a good path object Cocyl Y .

It is important to understand when functors defined on M are homotopy invariant, in the sense that they take homotopic maps to the same map. There are three results along this line, the most obvious of which is the least useful. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

There is a standard construction of WFS’s and model categories, which is based on Quillen’s “small object argument”. The latter is a general method for starting with a set, I say, of maps of M and constructing from I a functorial WFS ( (I  ), I  ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The small object argument is often repeated in the model category literature, but it admits a useful variant that we feel has not been sufficiently emphasized in print. 1 We call the variant the compact object argument (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In many basic examples, such as topological spaces, chain complexes, and simplicial sets, only sequential colimits are required. When this is the case, we obtain a more concrete type of cofibrantly generated model category called a compactly generated model category. In such cases we are free to ignore transfinite cell complexes. Compactly generated model categories are attractive to us since the relevant cell theory is much closer to classical cell theory in algebraic topology (e.g. [89]) and in homological algebra (e.g. [74]) than the transfinite version (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We feel that the general case of cofibrantly generated model categories is overemphasized in the model category literature, and we urge the reader not to get bogged down in the details of the requisite smallness condition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We describe model structures in over and under “slice categories” in §15.3.

The essential starting point is to define I-cell complexes. When I is the set {S n −→ Dn+1 } of standard cell inclusions, all CW complexes will be examples of I-cell complexes as we define them (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remark 15.1.12. There is a general property of a category, called local presentability [12, §5.2], that ensures that any set I permits the small object argument. In such categories, this leads to a more uniform and aesthetically satisfactory treatment of the small object argument. It is satisfied by most algebraically defined categories. It is not satisfied by the category of compactly generated topological spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

However, if instead of using all compact Hausdorff spaces in the definition of compactly generated spaces [89, p. 37], one only uses standard simplices, one obtains the locally presentable category of “combinatorial spaces”. It appears that one can redo all of algebraic topology with combinatorial spaces replacing compactly generated spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 15.2.1. A model category M is cofibrantly generated if there are (small) sets I and J of maps such that C = C (I) and C ∩W = C (J ) and therefore F = J  and F ∩W = I  . The sets I and J are called the generating cofibrations and generating acyclic cofibrations. We say that M is compactly generated if, further, I and J are compact, in which case only ordinary sequential cell complexes are needed to define C (I) and C (J ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Remark 15.2.2. A combinatorial model category is a locally presentable category that is also a cofibrantly generated model category [9]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

For example, Theorem 15.2.3 is often used to transport a model structure across an adjunction, as we formalize in Theorem 16.2.5 below, and then only the acyclicity condition need be verified (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=237" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 237</a>)</p>
The acyclicity condition clearly holds if J ⊂ W and W is a left saturated class of maps in the sense of Definition 14.1.7. This rarely applies since pushouts of weak equivalences are generally not weak equivalences. However, pushouts of coproducts of maps in J often are weak equivalences, and verifying that is usually the key step in verifying the acyclicity condition.

Definition 15.3.1. Let M be a category and B be an object of M . The slice category B/M of objects under B has objects the maps i = iX : B −→ X in M and morphisms the maps f : X −→ Y such that f ◦ iX = iY (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 15.4.1. A model category M is left proper if the pushout of a weak equivalence along a cofibration is a weak equivalence. This means that if i is a cofibration and f is a weak equivalence in a pushout diagram A f i B j X g /Y then g is a weak equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The following concept will play a significant role in our discussion of Bousfield localization in Chapter 19, and it is important throughout model category theory.

Over and under model structures often play a helpful technical role in proofs, as is well illustrated by their use in the proof of the following result. One point is that appropriate maps can be viewed as cofibrant or fibrant objects in model categories, allowing us to apply results about such objects to maps.

Ponto 240</a>)</p>
Proposition 15.4.2. Let M be a model category. Then any pushout of a weak equivalence between cofibrant objects along a cofibration is a weak equivalence, hence M is left proper if every object of M is cofibrant (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 15.4.3. A model category M satisfies the left gluing lemma if, for any commutative diagram A f C i o g k /B h A ′ o C ′ j o ℓ B′ in which i and j are cofibrations and f , g, and h are weak equivalences, the induced map of pushouts A ∪C B −→ A ′ ∪C ′ B ′ is a weak equivalence.

Proposition 15.4.4. A model category M is left or right proper if and only if it satisfies the left or right gluing lemma (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 241</a>)</p>
In our examples, we sometimes prove the gluing lemma directly, because it is no more difficult. However, in deeper examples it is often easier to check that the model structure is left proper and to use the previous result to deduce that the left gluing lemma holds (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let i : A −→ X be a map in M and Z be an object of M . Consider the induced map (15.5.1) i ∗ : [X, Z] −→ [A, Z] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 242</a>)</p>
of hom sets in HoM . We describe how we can sometimes deduce that i ∗ is a bijection directly from lifting properties and, conversely, how we can sometimes deduce lifting properties when i ∗ is a bijection. While i will be a cofibration and Z will be fibrant, the force of these results comes from the fact that the relevant lifting properties concern pairs of maps, neither of which need be a weak equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

it well illustrates how important it is to know whether or not a model structure is left or right proper (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 15.5.2. Define the homotopy pushout (or double mapping cylinder) M (f, g) of a pair of maps f : A −→ X and g : A −→ Y to be the pushout of f ∐ g : A ∐ A −→ X ∐ Y along the cofibration i0 + i1 : A ∐ A −→ Cyl A of a good cylinder object Cyl A (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Left and right Quillen adjoints are the most common source of left and right derived functors (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

we describe the 2-categorical way of understanding the passage to derived homotopy categories and we explain that double categories, rather than categories or 2-categories, give the appropriate conceptual framework for understanding maps between model categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

One small point that deserves more emphasis than it receives in the literature is that there is a familiar classical notion of homotopy in the enriched categories that appear in nature, and the model categorical notion of homotopy and the classical notion of homotopy can be used interchangably in such contexts. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=247" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 247</a>)</p>
Having defined model categories, we want next to define functors and natural transformations between them in such a way that they give “derived” functors and natural transformations on passage to their derived homotopy categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=247" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 247</a>)</p>
We say that a functor F : M −→ N between categories with weak equivalences is homotopical if it takes weak equivalences to weak equivalences, and we say that a functor F : M −→ HoN or more generally a functor F : M −→ H for any other category H is homotopical if it takes weak equivalences to isomorphisms. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=247" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 247</a>)</p>
. The universal property of localization then gives a functor ̃ F̃ : HoM −→ HoN in the first case or ̃ F̃ : HoM −→ H in the general case (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=247" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 247</a>)</p>
The functor ̃ F̃ is a derived functor of F . However, this will not suffice for the applications. As we have already said, most functors F that we encounter are not homotopical, and then it is too much to expect that diagrams such as those above commute; rather, we often obtain diagrams like these that commute up to a natural transformation that is characterized by a universal property (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=248" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 248</a>)</p>
We note parenthetically that there are also functors that in some sense deserve the name of a derived functor and yet are neither left nor right derived in the sense we are about to define. The theory of such functors is not well understood, but they appear in applications (e.g. [93]) and have been given a formal description in [124]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 16.1.1. A left derived functor of a functor F : M −→ H is a functor LF : HoM −→ H together with a natural transformation µ : LF ◦ γ −→ F such that for any functor K : HoM −→ H and natural transformation ξ : K ◦γ −→ F , there is a unique natural transformation σ : K −→ LF such that the composite µ ◦ (σ · γ) : K ◦ γ −→ LF ◦ γ −→ F coincides with ξ. That is, (LF, µ) is terminal among pairs (K, ξ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We use · to denote the composite of a natural transformation and a functor; categorically, that is often called whiskering (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Since left derived functors are characterized by a universal property, they are unique up to canonical isomorphism if they exist. Confusingly, they are examples of what are known categorically as right Kan extensions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 16.1.3. If F : M −→ H takes acyclic cofibrations between cofibrant objects to isomorphisms, then the left derived functor (LF, µ) exists. Moreover, for any cofibrant object X of M , µ : LF X −→ F X is an isomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 16.2.1. Let F : M −→ N and U : N −→ M be left and right adjoint. The pair (F, U ) is a Quillen adjunction if the following equivalent conditions are satisfied.

Ponto 251</a>)</p>
The Quillen adjunction (F, U ) is a Quillen equivalence if for any map f : F X −→ Y with adjoint g : X −→ U Y , where X is cofibrant and Y is fibrant, f is a weak equivalence in N if and only if g is a weak equivalence in M .

Many of the applications concern adjunctions (F, U ) where F specifies free structured objects (such as monoids, algebras, etc) and U forgets the structure on these objects.

Ponto 251</a>)</p>
Proposition 16.2.2. If (F, U ) is a Quillen adjunction, then the total derived functors LF and RU exist and form an adjoint pair. If (F, U ) is a Quillen equivalence, then (LF, RU ) is an adjoint equivalence between HoM and HoN . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 251</a>)</p>
The criterion of Proposition 16.2.3(v) is especially useful since a standard way to build a model category structure on N is to use an adjunction (F, U ) to create it from a model structure on M , setting WN = U −1 (WM ) and FN = U −1 (FM ). The following result, which is [63, 11.3.2], is frequently used for this purpose. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 252</a>)</p>
More deeply, it masks one of the greatest difficulties of model category theory and of the theory of derived functors in general. Good properties of left adjoints are preserved under composition of left adjoints. However, it is in practice very often necessary to compose left adjoints with right adjoints. Results about such composites are hard to come by. They are often truly deep mathematics. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

However, the categorical considerations of greatest relevance to the applications of model category theory concern enrichment from hom sets to hom objects (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A monoidal structure on a category V is a product, ⊗ say, and a unit object I such that the product is associative and unital up to coherent natural isomorphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Informally, coherence means that diagrams that intuitively should commute do in fact commute. (The symmetry coherence admits a weakening that gives braided monoidal categories, but those will not concern us.) A symmetric monoidal category V is closed if it has internal hom objects V (X, Y ) in V together with adjunction isomorphisms V (X ⊗ Y, Z) ∼ = ∼ = V (X, V (Y, Z)). These isomorphisms of hom sets imply isomorphisms of internal hom objects in V V (X ⊗ Y, Z) ∼ = ∼ = V (X, V (Y, Z)). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

From now on, we let V be a bicomplete closed symmetric monoidal category. Such categories appear so often in nature that category theorists have invented a name for them: such a category is often called a “cosmos”. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

When ⊗ is the cartesian product, we say that V is cartesian closed, but the same category V can admit other symmetric monoidal structures (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The category U∗ of based spaces is closed symmetric monoidal under the smash product.

The category sSet of simplicial sets is cartesian closed. A simplicial set is a contravariant functor ∆ −→ Set, where ∆ is the category of sets n = {0, 1, · · · , n} and monotonic maps. There are n-simplices ∆[n] in sSet, and n 7→ ∆[n] gives a covariant functor ∆ −→ sSet (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

For a commutative ring R, the category MR of R-modules is closed symmetric monoidal under the functors ⊗R and HomR ; in particular, the category Ab of abelian groups is closed symmetric monoidal (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For a commutative ring R, the category ChR of Z-graded chain complexes of R-modules (with differential lowering degree) is closed symmetric monoidal under the graded tensor product and hom functors (X ⊗R Y )n = Σp+q=n Xp ⊗R Yq ; d(x ⊗ y) = d(x) ⊗ y + (−1) p x ⊗ d(y).

Definition 16.3.3. Let V be a symmetric monoidal category. A V -category M , or a category M enriched over V , consists of (i) a class of objects, with typical objects denoted X, Y , Z; (ii) for each pair of objects (X, Y ), a hom object M (X, Y ) in V ; (iii) for each object X, a unit map idX : I −→ M (X, X) in V ; (iv) for each triple of objects (X, Y, Z), a composition morphism in V M (Y, Z) ⊗ M (X, Y ) −→ M (X, Z).

Categories as usually defined are categories enriched in Set. (ii) Categories enriched in Ab are called Ab-categories. They are called additive categories if they have zero objects and biproducts [77, p. 196]. They are called abelian categories if, further, all maps have kernels and cokernels, every monomorphism is a kernel, and every epimorphism is a cokernel (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

(iii) Categories enriched in U are called topological categories. (iv) Categories enriched in sSet are called simplicial categories. (v) Categories enriched in ChR for some R are called DG-categories. (vi) Categories enriched in Cat are called (strict) 2-categories and, inductively, categories enriched in the cartesian monoidal category of (n − 1)-categories are called (strict) n-categories.

For any ring R, not necessarily commutative, the category of left R-modules is abelian (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Most of the model category literature focuses on simplicial categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

However, there are important enriched categorical notions that take account of the extra structure given by the enrichment and are not just reinterpretations of ordinary categorical notions. In particular, there are weighted (or indexed) colimits and limits. The most important of these (in non-standard notation) are tensors X ⊙V (sometimes called copowers) and cotensors (sometimes called powers) Φ(V, X) in M for objects X ∈ M and V ∈ V . These are characterized by natural isomorphisms (16.3.6) M (X ⊙ V, Y ) ∼ = ∼ = V (V, M (X, Y )) ∼ = ∼ = M (X, Φ(V, Y )) of hom sets. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The functor V (I, −) is a right adjoint and therefore preserves limits, such as pullbacks; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We have defined categories enriched in a symmetric monoidal category V , and we have observed that one such V is the cartesian monoidal category Cat, the category of categories and functors (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We have also observed that a category enriched in Cat is called a 2-category. An example is Cat itself. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We think of functors as morphisms between categories and natural transformations as morphisms between functors. We also have two 2-categories ModCatℓ and ModCatr of model categories. Their objects (or 0-cells) are model categories, their morphisms (or 1-cells) are Quillen left adjoints and Quillen right adjoints, respectively, and their morphisms between morphisms (or 2-cells) are natural transformations in both cases.

A pseudo-functor F : C −→ D between 2-categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

assigns 0-cells, 1-cells, and 2-cells in D to 0-cells, 1-cells, and 2-cells in C . For each fixed pair X, Y of 0-cells, F specifies a functor C (X, Y ) −→ D(FX, FY ). However, for 0-cells X, F(IdX ) need not equal IdFX and, for composable 1-cells F and G, F(G ◦ F ) need not equal FG ◦ FF . Rather, there are 2-cell isomorphisms connecting these. These isomorphisms are subject to coherence axioms asserting that certain associativity and left and right unity diagrams commute (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 16.5.1. Passage from model categories to their derived homotopy categories HoM , derived functors, and derived natural transformations specify pseudo-functors L : ModCatℓ −→ Cat and R : ModCatr −→ Cat.

The proper framework is given by viewing model categories as forming not a pair of 2-categories, but rather as a single double category (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Just as we can define a category enriched in any symmetric monoidal category V , we can define an internal category in any complete category V . It has object and morphism objects Ob and Mor in V together with maps S, T : Mor −→ Ob, I : Ob −→ Mor, and C : Mor ×Ob Mor −→ Mor in V , called source, target, identity, and composition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 263</a>)</p>
An ordinary category is an internal category in the category of sets. Internal categories in the category U of topological spaces appear frequently. A double category is just an internal category in Cat. A 2-category can be viewed as a double category whose object category is discrete, meaning that it has only identity morphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 263</a>)</p>
It has 0-cells, namely the objects of the category Ob, it has both “vertical” and “horizontal” 1-cells, namely the morphisms of Ob and the objects of Mor, and it has 2-cells, namely the morphisms of Mor.

Thus let M be a category with a subcategory W of weak equivalences. We form a double category D(M , W ) whose objects are the objects of M , whose horizontal and vertical 1-cells are the morphisms of M and of W , and whose 2-cells are commutative diagrams X f v Y w  X ′ g / Y′ in which v, w ∈ W . Thinking in terms of the arrow category of M , we can view this square as a morphism v −→ w between vertical arrows or as a morphism f −→ g between horizontal arrows.

Ponto 264</a>)</p>
The reason for introducing this language is that it gives a way of expressing L and R as part of a single kind of functor, namely a double pseudofunctor F : D −→ E between double categories. Such an F assigns 0-cells, vertical 1-cells, horizontal 1-cells, and 2-cells in D to the corresponding kinds of cells in C . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Corollary 16.5.4. If F is both a Quillen left adjoint and a Quillen right adjoint, then LF ∼ = ∼ RF . = The real force of Theorem 16.5.3 concerns the comparisons it induces between composites of left and right derived adjoint base change functors (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem 16.5.3. Model categories are the 0-cells of a double category Mod whose vertical and horizontal 1-cells are the Quillen left and right adjoints and whose 2-cells are the natural transformations. There is a double pseudofunctor F : Mod −→ Q(Cat) such that Fv = L and Fh = R. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 264</a>)</p>
This result encodes many relationships between left and right Quillen adjoints in a form that is familiar in other categorical contexts. The Quillen adjunctions (F, U ) are examples of the correct categorical notion of an adjunction in a double category, called a conjunction in (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 264</a>)</p>
The central point we want to make is that there are three intertwined model structures on the relevant categories, and that the least familiar, which is called the mixed model structure and was introduced relatively recently by Michael Cole [31], is in some respects the most convenient (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=265" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 265</a>)</p>
In fact, we shall argue that algebraic topologists, from the very beginning of the subject, have by preference worked implicitly in the mixed model structure on topological spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The most obvious homotopical notion of a weak equivalence is an actual homotopy equivalence. We call such maps h-equivalences for short. It is natural to expect there to be a model category structure on the category U of compactly generated spaces in which the weak equivalences are the h-equivalences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The cofibrations are the maps i : A −→ X that satisfy the homotopy extension property (HEP) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=265" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 265</a>)</p>
The fibrations are the maps p : E −→ B that satisfy the covering homotopy property (CHP). This means that for all spaces A they satisfy the RLP with respect to the inclusion i0 : A −→ A × I. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

This means that for all spaces B they satisfy the LLP with respect to the map p0 : B I −→ B given by evaluation at 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

call these Hurewicz cofibrations and Hurewicz fibrations, conveniently abbreviated to h-cofibrations and h-fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 266</a>)</p>
These cofibrations and fibrations were not considered by Quillen in his paper introducing model categories [112], but Strøm [128] later proved a version of the following result. Technically, he worked in the category of all spaces, not just the compactly generated ones, and in that category the model theoretic cofibrations are the Hurewicz cofibrations that are closed inclusions. However, as we left as an exercise in [89, p. 46], the Hurewicz cofibrations in U are closed inclusions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 17.1.1 (h-model structure). The category U is a monoidal model category whose weak equivalences, cofibrations, and fibrations, denoted (Wh , Ch , Fh ), are the h-equivalences, h-cofibrations, and h-fibrations. All spaces are both h-fibrant and h-cofibrant, hence this model structure is proper (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 266</a>)</p>
Corollary 17.1.2. The category U∗ of based spaces in U is a proper model category whose weak equivalences, cofibrations, and fibrations are the based maps that are h-equivalences, h-cofibrations, and h-fibrations when regarded as maps in U . The pair (T, U ), where T is given by adjoining disjoint basepoints and U is the forgetful functor, is a Quillen adjunction relating U to U∗ . Moreover, U∗ is a monoidal model category with respect to the smash product. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 266</a>)</p>
Remark 17.1.3. In the first half of the book, we worked thoughout in the category T of nondegenerately based spaces in U . These are precisely the hcofibrant objects in the h-model category of all based spaces. There is an elementary cofibrant approximation functor, called whiskering. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The left adjoint (−) × I commutes with colimits (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 268</a>)</p>
We have completed the proof that U is a model category (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 268</a>)</p>
In the first half of the book, we assumed that all spaces had the homotopy types of CW-complexes. Therefore there was no distinction between a homotopy equivalence and a weak homotopy equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Note that the most natural kind of based cell complexes would start with based cells S n −→ Dn+1 for chosen basepoints of spheres and would have based attaching maps. While such cell complexes are useful, they can only model connected based spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 271</a>)</p>
When we specialize to spaces, the statements in the rest of the section give model theoretic refinements of classical results, and the reader may wish to skip to the next section, referring back to this one as needed. For example, the first part of the following result refines the Whitehead theorem that a weak equivalence between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=272" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 272</a>)</p>
Therefore the category of CW homotopy types in T used in the first half of this book is the full subcategory of the category U∗ whose objects are the mcofibrant based spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 278</a>)</p>
It has long been accepted that the q-equivalences give the definitively right weak equivalences for classical homotopy theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 278</a>)</p>
The fibrations most frequently used in practice are the Hurewicz fibrations rather than the Serre fibrations. There are good reasons for this. For example, Hurewicz fibrations, but not Serre fibrations, are determined locally, in the sense of the following result (e.g. [84, 3.8]). It generalizes a theorem of Hurewicz [67]. Theorem 17.4.4. Let p : E −→ B be a surjective map and assume that B has a numerable open cover {U } such that each restriction p−1 U −→ U is an h-fibration. Then p is an h-fibration. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 278</a>)</p>
The proof uses the characterization of h-fibrations in terms of path lifting functions [89, §7.2], and that characterization itself often gives an easy way of checking that a map is an h-fibration. Paradoxically, this means that it is often easiest to prove that a map is a q-fibration by proving the stronger statement that it is an h-fibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=278" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 278</a>)</p>
These considerations argue for the h-fibrations, Fh , as our preferred subcategory of fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 278</a>)</p>
The mixed model structure has all of the good formal properties of the q-model structure. It is almost certainly not cofibrantly generated, but that is irrelevant to the applications (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 278</a>)</p>
Any map with the name cofibration should at least be a classical Hurewicz cofibration, and an m-cofibration is an h-cofibration that is a q-cofibration up to homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition 17.3.4(i) generalizes the relative version of the Whitehead theorem that a weak equivalence between cell complexes is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 278</a>)</p>
Cell complexes are more general than CW complexes, but any cell complex is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. Therefore, in the mixed model structure, we can use cell and CW complexes interchangeably (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=279" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 279</a>)</p>
One is to first approximate any space X by a weakly equivalent CW complex, (e.g. [89, §10.5]), and then use the Whitehead theorem (e.g. [89, §10.3]) to show that any cell approximation of X is homotopy equivalent to the constructed CW approximation. The other is to inductively deform any given cell complex to a homotopy equivalent CW complex by cellular approximation of its attaching maps. The geometric realization of the total singular complex of X gives a particularly nice functorial CW approximation (e.g. [89, §16.2]), and it is a functorial cofibrant approximation in both the q and the m-model structures. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=279" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 279</a>)</p>
A central reason for preferring the m to the q-model structure is that it is generally quite hard to check whether or not a given space is actually homeomorphic to a cell or CW complex, whereas there are powerful classical theorems that characterize spaces of the homotopy types of CW complexes. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 279</a>)</p>
For an elementary example of this, there are many contractible spaces that cannot be homeomorphic to cell complexes; cones on badly behaved spaces give examples (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Although the standard model structure on simplicial sets is very convenient and useful, the proofs that it is indeed a model structure are notoriously involved (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The senior author has long believed that simpler proofs should be possible (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In retrospect, each gives a fibrant replacement functor on simplicial sets with unusually nice properties: both of these functors preserve fibrations and finite limits. Our proof of the model axioms requires use of these properties, but it is irrelevant which of the functors we use. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Our starting point is the following definition, part (iii) of which is not but ought to be the standard definition of a weak equivalence of simplicial sets (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 17.5.1. Let f : X −→ Y be a map of simplicial sets. (i) f is a cofibration if the map fq : Xq −→ Yq of q-simplices is an injection for each q; equivalently, f is a categorical monomorphism. In particular, every simplicial set is cofibrant. (ii) f is a fibration if it is a Kan fibration. This means that f satisfies the RLP with respect to all horns Λ k [n] −→ ∆[n]. In particular, the fibrant objects are the Kan complexes. (iii) f is a weak equivalence if f ∗ : π(Y, Z) −→ π(X, Z) is a bijection for all Kan complexes Z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Let (T, S) denote the adjoint pair between S and U given by geometric realization and the total singular complex; T X is usually denoted |X|, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 280</a>)</p>
Note that in contrast with spaces, homotopy groups do not enter into the definition of weak equivalences. One reason is that they are not easily defined for general simplicial sets. However, they admit a direct combinatorial definition for Kan complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=280" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 280</a>)</p>
The equivalence of (ii) and (iii) is formal. Since the Kan complexes are the bifibrant objects in S , this result should be viewed as the simplicial analogue of the Whitehead theorem that a weak equivalence between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma 17.5.5. The functor S takes spaces to Kan complexes, takes Serre fibrations to Kan fibrations, and preserves limits (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Lemma 17.5.6. The functor T preserves finite limits, hence so does the composite functor ST . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 17.5.10. For a Kan complex X, the unit η : X −→ ST X of the adjunction is a combinatorial weak equivalence and therefore a homotopy equivalence. Corollary 17.5.11. For a space Y , the counit ε : T SY −→ Y of the adjunction is a q-equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 282</a>)</p>
Proof. As with any adjunction, the composite SY η / ST SY Sε SY is the identity map (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Corollary 17.5.13. For any simplicial set X, the unit η : X −→ ST X is a weak equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 17.5.12 means that the left adjoint T creates the weak equivalences in S . In most other adjoint pair situations, it is the right adjoint that creates the weak equivalences. The difference is central to the relative difficulty in proving the model category axioms in S . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

As a left adjoint, T preserves all colimits (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=284" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 284</a>)</p>
Remark 17.6.7. There is no h-model structure on simplicial sets in the literature, and it does not seem sensible to try to define one. One point is just that the unit interval simplicial set I = ∆[1] is asymmetric and the obvious notion of homotopy is not an equivalence relation. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Again, as in topology, we believe that the m-model structure is central and deserves much more attention than it has received in the literature (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The category ChR is bicomplete. Limits and colimits in ChR are just limits and colimits of the underlying R-modules, constructed degreewise, with the naturally induced differentials. Here we use the term R-module for a graded R-module, without differentials (or with differential identically zero). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Recall from §16.3 that a cosmos is a bicomplete closed symmetric monoidal category. The category ChZ is a cosmos under ⊗ and Hom (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The category ChR is enriched, tensored and cotensored over ChZ . The chain complex of morphisms X −→ Y is HomR (X, Y ), where HomR (X, Y ) is the subcomplex of Hom(X, Y ) consisting of those maps f that are maps of underlying R-modules.

Observe that since the zero module 0 is both an initial and terminal object in ChR , the analogy to make is with based rather than unbased spaces. For n ∈ Z, we define S n , the n-sphere chain complex, to be Z concentrated in degree n with zero differential. For any integer n, we define the n-fold suspension Σn X of an R-chain complex X to be X ⊗ S n . Thus (Σn X)n+q ∼ = Xq . The notation is motivated by the observation that if we define πn (X) to be the abelian group of chain homotopy classes of maps S n −→ X (ignoring the R-module structure), then πn (X) = Hn (X). The motto is that homology is a special case of homotopy and that homological algebra is a special case of homotopical algebra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We used the notations ⊙ and Φ for tensors and cotensors earlier, but we will use ⊗ and Hom here, where these again mean ⊗Z and HomZ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Analogously, we define D n+1 to be the (n + 1)-disk chain complex. It is Z in degrees n and n + 1 and zero in all other degrees. There is only one differential that can be non-zero, and we choose that differential to be the identity map Z −→ Z. The copy of Z in degree n is identified with S n and is quite literally the boundary of Dn+1 . We agree to write SR n R n+1 = R ⊗ S n and DR R = R ⊗ Dn+1 .

We define I to be the cellular chains of the unit interval. It is the chain complex with one basis element [I] in degree 1, two basis elements [0] and [1] in degrees 0, and differential d([I]) = [0] − [1].

In ChR , coproducts are direct sums and the pushout of maps f : A −→ X and g : A −→ Y is the “difference cokernel” (X ⊕ Y )/Im(f − g). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We have two natural categories of weak equivalences in ChR . The h-equivalences are the homotopy equivalences of R-chain complexes, and the q-equivalences are the quasi-isomorphisms, namely those maps of R-chain complexes that induce an isomorphism on passage to the homology of the underlying chain complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We let hChR denote the ordinary homotopy category of ChR and call it the classical homotopy category of ChR .

Consider the category A/ChR of chain complexes under a chain complex R. Let X and Y be R-chain complexes under A, with given maps i : A −→ X and j : A −→ Y . Two maps f, g : X −→ Y under A are said to be homotopic under A, or relative to A, if there is a homotopy h : X ⊗ I −→ Y between them such that h(a ⊗ [I]) = 0 for a ∈ A. That is, h restricts on A ⊗ I to the algebraic version of the constant homotopy at j. A cofiber homotopy equivalence is a homotopy equivalence under A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Since the functor HomR (A, −) preserves finite direct sums of underlying graded R-modules (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

more sophisticated algebraic situations, there are h, r, and q-model structures, and they are all different. This happens, for example, if R is a commutative ring, A is a DG R-algebra, and we consider model structures on the category of differential graded A-modules 2 . In this situation, A need not be projective as an R-module, and then functors such as ⊗A and HomA rarely preserve exact sequences. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Relative homological algebra rectifies this by restricting the underlying notion of an exact sequence of A-modules to sequences that are degreewise split exact as sequences of graded R-modules (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 18.3.3.

Of course, such splittings are given by maps of underlying graded R-modules which need not be maps of chain complexes. The following result (due to Cole [30]) shows that the splittings can be deformed to chain maps if the given R-split maps are homotopy equivalences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 18.3.4. Let 0 /X f /Y g /Z /0 be an exact sequence of R-chain complexes whose underlying exact sequence of graded R-modules splits.

In topology, cellular approximation of maps allows us to replace cell complexes by equivalent CW complexes. In algebra, the comparison is much simpler and the difference is negligible since an “attaching n map” SR R −→ Fq X for a cell D n+1 R necessarily has image in the elements (Fq X)n of degree n. When we restrict attention to those X such that Xq = 0 for q < 0, as in classical projective resolutions, we may as well also restrict attention to those I-cell complexes such that Fq X = X≤q (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Of course, regarding an ungraded R-module M as a DG R-module concentrated in degree 0, a q-cofibrant approximation of M is exactly a projective resolution of M .

Remark 18.5.5.

The mixed model structure has all of the good formal properties of the q-model structure. It is proper, it is monoidal when R is commutative, and it is an ChZ -model structure in general. The identity functor on ChR is a right Quillen equivalence from the m-model structure to the q-model structure and therefore a left Quillen equivalence from the q-model structure to the m-model structure. The class Cm of m-cofibrations is very well-behaved (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Homotopy invariant constructions that start with complexes of projective R-modules automatically give m-cofibrant objects, but not necessarily degreewise projective objects. In particular, it is very often useful to study the perfect complexes, namely the objects of ChR that are homotopy equivalent to bounded complexes of finitely generated projective R-modules. These are the dualizable objects of HoChR (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

From the point of view of classical homological algebra, it is interesting to think of projective resolutions homotopically as analogues of approximation by CW complexes, well-defined only up to homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Of course, using either a q-cofibrant or m-cofibrant approximation P of an R-module M , regarded as a chain complex concentrated in degree 0, we have Tor R ∗ (N, M ) = H∗ (N ⊗R P ) and Ext∗ R (M, N ) = H ∗ HomR (P, N ), the latter regraded cohomologically. We can think of these as obtained by first applying the derived functors of N ⊗R (−) and HomR (−, N ) and then taking homology n groups or, equivalently, thinking in terms of spheres SR R , homotopy groups.

Indeed, this gives a new perspective on the construction of the homotopy category HoU of spaces from the naive homotopy category hU obtained by identifying homotopic maps and of the derived homotopy category HoChR of chain complexes from the naive homotopy category hChR .

There we concentrated on arithmetic localizations and completions that are closely related to standard algebraic constructions. We restricted our constructions to nilpotent spaces since that is the natural range of applicability of our elementary methodology and since most applications focus on such spaces. There are several different ways to generalize to non-nilpotent spaces, none of them well understood calculationally. Bousfield localization gives a general conceptual understanding of the most widely used of these, and it gives the proper perspective for generalizations to categories other than the category of spaces and (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

As will become clear, the resolvant objects in U are the spaces of the homotopy types of CW complexes, and this codifies the Whitehead theorem for such spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Little is known about the behavior on homotopy groups of localizations and completions of non-nilpotent spaces.

There is an extensive literature on f -localizations for a map f . The first existence proof is due to Bousfield [16], and the books [52, 63] study the foundations in detail. These sources work with simplicial sets. Dror Fajoun’s monograph [38] gives several variant existence proofs, and he explains how either simplicial sets or topological spaces can be used. His monograph analyzes many interesting examples in detail. Bousfield [18] gives a nice overview of this area, with many references. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remark 19.5.6. One can ask whether or not localizations at classes, rather than sets, of maps always exist. Remarkably, Casacuberta, Scevenels, and Smith [25] prove that this holds if Vopěnka’s principle (a certain large cardinal axiom) is valid, but that it cannot be proven using only the usual ZFC axioms of set theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We end our discussion of model categories and localization with a philosophical remark that contains a puzzling and interesting open problem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In particular, in the categories of spaces or chain complexes, we have the qmodel structure and the m-model structure with the same weak equivalences and therefore with equivalent homotopy categories. In these cases, all objects are fibrant and so the definition of L -local objects is the same in the two cases. However, the question of the existence of the L -model structure is still model dependent. Clearly, asking whether or not (L , C , FL ) is a model structure is a different question for (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remark 19.5.7. The notion of localizing a category M , or a homotopy category HoM , at a subcategory L of weak equivalences makes sense as a general matter of homotopical algebra, independent of model category theory. However, the general theory here depends on the chosen model structure since we have required L -local objects to be fibrant in a given model structure on M . Thus our definition of an L -local object really defines the notion of being L -local relative to a given model structure. For a fixed ambient category of weak equivalences W , there may be several model structures (W , C , F ) on M with different good properties (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 320</a>)</p>
The known existence proofs for L -local (or K -local) model structures on spaces start from the q-model structure. We actually do not know whether or not (L , Cm , Fℓ ) is a model structure even when we do know that (L , Cq , Fℓ ) is a model structure. We regard this as a quite unsatisfactory state of affairs, but we leave the existence of model structures (L , Cm , Fℓ ) as an open problem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

C = Cq and for C = Cm . Of course, FL depends on which choice we make, even though the fibrant objects are the same with both choices (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Thus the familiar concepts of algebra and module dualize to concepts of coalgebra and comodule, and the structures of algebra and coalgebra combine to give the notion of a bialgebra. Incorporating antipodes (sometimes called conjugations), we obtain the notion of a Hopf algebra. In the cocommutative case, bialgebras and Hopf algebras can be viewed as monoids and groups in the symmetric monoidal category of cocommutative coalgebras (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In categorical language, the category MR of graded R-modules is symmetric monoidal, and it is closed in the sense that there is a natural isomorphism Hom(A ⊗ B, C) ∼ = ∼ = Hom(A, Hom(B, C)); it sends f to g, where g(a)(b) = f (a ⊗ b) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We say that A is projective if each Ai is projective (over R), and we say that A is of finite type if each Ai is finitely generated (over R). We say that A is bounded if it is non-zero in only finitely many degrees. Thus A is finitely generated if and only if it is bounded and of finite type. We say that A is bounded below (or above) if Ai = 0 for i sufficiently small (or large). Then ν is an isomorphism if A is bounded and either A or C is projective of finite type, ρ is an isomorphism if A is projective of finite type, and the last map α is an isomorphism if A and B are bounded below and A or B is projective of finite type (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 20.2.1. An R-algebra A = (A, φ, η) is a graded R-module A together with a product φ : A ⊗ A → A and unit η : R → A such that the following diagrams commute (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

An augmentation of A is a morphism of algebras ε : A → R. Given ε, ker ε is denoted IA and called the augmentation ideal of A; since εη = id, A ∼ = ∼ = R ⊕ IA.

Definition 20.2.3. Let A be a flat R-module.

That is, φ is a morphism of coalgebras or, equivalently, ψ is a morphism of algebras. If the associativity of φ and coassociativity of ψ are deleted from the definition, then A is said to be a quasi bialgebra 1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The flatness of A is usually not assumed but holds in practice; in its absence, the notion of bialgebra is perhaps too esoteric to be worthy of contemplation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In the first case, that is a familiar fact from classical algebra since the intersection of the powers of a (two-sided) ideal in a ring can be non-zero [6, p. 110].

For a monoid G, the monoid ring R[G] is a bialgebra with product, coproduct, unit and counit induced by the product, diagonal, identity element, and trivial function G −→ {pt}.

. Historically, the concept of Hopf algebra originated in algebraic topology, where the term “Hopf algebra” was used for what we are calling a bialgebra (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

the bialgebras that usually appear in algebraic topology automatically have antipodes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We have followed the algebraic literature in using the name antipode and distinguishing between bialgebras and Hopf algebras because of the more recent interest in Hopf algebras of a kind that do not seem to appear in algebraic topology, such as quantum groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Recall that, in any category with products, we have the notion of a monoid, namely an object with an associative and unital product, and of a group, namely a monoid with an antipode.

Proposition 20.3.4. The tensor product is the categorical product in the category C of commutative coalgebras. A cocommutative bialgebra is a monoid in C , and a cocommutative Hopf algebra is a group in C . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Construction 20.3.5. Let C be a coalgebra and A be an algebra. Then Hom(C, A) is an algebra, called a convolution algebra.

If C is unital with unit η and A is augmented with augmentation ε, then the set G(C, A) of maps of R-modules f : C −→ A such that f η = η and εf = ε is a submonoid of Hom(C, A) under the convolution product ∗.

For a right A-module (M, λ) and left A-module (N, ξ), the tensor product M ⊗A N , which of course is just an R-module, can be described as the cokernel of λ ⊗ id − id ⊗ξ : M ⊗ A ⊗ N → M ⊗ N ; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If A is a connected algebra and N is a left A-module, then N = 0 if and only if QN = 0. Proof. Clearly QN = 0 if and only if IA ⊗ N → N is an epimorphism, and this implies that N is zero by induction on degrees (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We here prove the basic results of Milnor and Moore on tensor product decompositions of connected Hopf algebras.

Then there is an isomorphism f : B → A ⊗ QB which is a map of both left A-modules and right QB-comodules (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Since a direct summand of a flat module is flat, the assumption on π implies that QB is flat if B is flat. Of course, when R is a field, as is the case in most applications, the only assumption is that ι : A → B be a monomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

If X is a based space, then H∗ (X; R), if R-flat, is a unital component coalgebra. Similarly, H∗ (ΩX; R), if R-flat, is a grouplike component Hopf algebra; it is connected if and only if X is simply connected (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The homology Hopf algebras H∗ (BU ; Z) and H∗ (BO; F2 ) enjoy a very special property: they are self-dual, so that they are isomorphic to the cohomology Hopf algebras H ∗ (BU ; Z) and H ∗ (BO; F2 ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We assume that the reader knows that the cohomology Hopf algebras are given by (21.4.1) H ∗ (BU ; Z) = P {ci | i ≥ 1} with ψ(cn ) = giv i+j=n ci ⊗ cj and (21.4.2) H ∗ (BO; F2 ) = P {wi | i ≥ 1} with ψ(wn ) = i+j=n wi ⊗ wj .

The calculations of H ∗ (BU (n); Z) and H ∗ (BO(n); F2 ) are summarized in [89, pp 187, 195], and passage to colimits over n gives the stated conclusions.

any such f factors uniquely as p ◦ f ˜ f˜ for a morphism f ˜ f˜: B −→ M A of Hopf algebras. Lemma 21.4.7. Universal Hopf algebras exist and are unique.

A punch line, explained at the end of the section, is that the conceptual argument applies to much more sophisticated cobordism theories, where the actual calculations are far more difficult.

In this section, R is assumed to be a perfect field of characteristic p.

It is a well kept secret that the further one goes into the subject, the less one uses such complexes for actual calculation. Rather, one starts with a few spaces whose homology and cohomology groups can be computed by hand, using explicit chain complexes. One then bootstraps up such calculations to the vast array of currently known computations using a variety of spectral sequences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

McCleary’s book [95] is a good encyclopedic reference for the various spectral sequences in current use. Other introductions can be found in many texts in algebraic topology and homological algebra [76, 120, 138] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 24.1.1. A homologically graded spectral sequence E = {E r } consists of a sequence of Z-bigraded R modules E r = {Ep,q r }r≥1 together with differentials d r : E p r p,q → E r p−r,q+r−1 ∼ H∗ (E r ). A morphism f : E → E ′ of spectral sequences is a such that E r+1 = family of morphisms of complexes f r : E r → E ′r such that f r+1 is the morphism H∗ (f r ) induced by f r .

These identifications give a sequence of submodules 0 = B 0 ⊂ B 1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Z 2 ⊂ Z 1 ⊂ Z 0 = E 1 .

r Note that elements of Ep p,0 cannot be boundaries for r ≥ 2 since the differential d r : E p r p+r,−r+1 −→ E r p,0 has domain the 0 group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

r Similarly, for r ≥ 1, E0 0,q consists only of cycles and so there are epimorphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The maps eB and eF are called edge homomorphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

This map is called the transgression. It is an additive relation [76, II.6] from a 2 submodule of Ep p,0 2 to a quotient module of E0 0,p−1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Example 24.2.3. Let C be a torsion free chain complex over Z. From the short exact sequence of groups 0 /Z p /Z / Z/pZ /0 we obtain a short exact sequence of chain complexes 0 /C /C / C ⊗ Z/pZ /0. The induced long exact homology sequence is an exact couple (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The resulting spectral sequence is called the mod p Bockstein spectral sequence . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

When r = 1, this is the universal coefficient exact sequence for calculating Hn (C; Fp ), and we may view it as a higher universal coefficient exact sequence in general (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We conclude that complete knowledge of the Bockstein spectral sequences of C for all primes p allows a complete description of H∗ (C) as a graded abelian group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The previous example shows that if X is a space whose homology is of finite type and if one can compute H∗ (X; Q) and H∗ (X; Fp ) together with the mod p Bockstein spectral sequences for all primes p, then one can read off H∗ (X; Z). For this reason, among others, algebraic topologists rarely concern themselves with integral homology but rather focus on homology with field coefficients (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let A be a Z-graded complex of modules. An (increasing) filtration of A is a sequence of subcomplexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 24.3.2. If A = ∪p Fp A and for each n there exists s(n) such that Fs(n) An = 0, then E ∞ p,q 0 A = Ep p,q H∗ (A). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The proof is tedious, but elementary. We give it in the last section of the chapter for illustrative purposes. The conclusion of the theorem, E ∞ p,q A ∼ = ∼ 0 = Ep,q H∗ (A), is often written E 2 p,q A ⇒ Hp+q (A), and E r is said to converge to H∗ (A). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Dually, cohomology spectral sequences arise naturally from decreasing filtrations of complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In practice, we often start with a homological filtered complex and dualize it to obtain a cohomological one, setting A ∗ = Hom(A, R) and filtering it by F p A ∗ = Hom(A/Fp−1 A, R) At least when R is a field, the resulting cohomology spectral sequence is dual to the homology spectral sequence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Recall that a differential graded algebra (DGA) A over R is a graded algebra with a product that is a map of chain complexes, so that the Leibnitz formula d(xy) = d(x)y + (−1) degx xd(y) is satisfied. When suitably filtered, A often gives rise to a spectral sequence of DGA’s, meaning that each term E r is a DGA. It is no exaggeration to say that the calculational utility of spectral sequences largely stems from such multiplicative structure. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Leibnitz formula for each r ≥ 1. Example 24.4.3. The cup product in the singular cochains C ∗ (X) gives rise to the product φ : H ∗ (X; Fp ) ⊗ H ∗ (X; Fp ) → H ∗ (X; Fp ). Regarding H ∗ (X; Fp ) as the E1 term of the Bockstein spectral sequence of the cochain complex C ∗ (X), we find that φ satisfies µ. Therefore each E r in the mod p cohomology Bockstein spectral sequence of X is a DGA, and E r+1 = H ∗ (E r ) as an algebra (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In applications, the important thing is to understand what the properties say. Their proofs generally play no role. In fact, this is true of most spectral sequences in algebraic topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

It is usual to construct the Serre spectral using the singular (or, in Serre’s original work, cubical) chains of all spaces in sight. We give a more direct homotopical construction that has the advantage that it generalizes effortlessly to a construction of the Serre spectral sequence in generalized homology and cohomology theories.

Using [89, p. 48], we may as well replace p by a Hurewicz fibration.

A short exact sequence 1 −→ G ′ −→ G −→ G ′′ −→ 1 of (discrete) groups gives a fibration sequence K(G ′ , 1) −→ K(G, 1) −→ K(G ′′ , 1), and there result Serre spectral sequences in homology and cohomology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A manifold is a topological space which is locally modelled on Rn . The notion of what it means to be locally modelled on Rn can be made definite in many different ways, yielding many different sorts of manifolds. In general, to define a kind of manifold, we need to define a set G of gluing maps which are to be permitted for piecing the manifold together out of chunks of Rn . Such a manifold is called a Gmanifold. G should satisfy some obvious properties which make it a pseudogroup of local homeomorphisms between open sets of Rn : (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

For instance, given a constant λ > 1 consider an annulus of radii 1 and λ + ǫ. Identify neighborhoods of the two boundary components by the map x → λx. The resulting manifold, topologically, is T 2 .

Milnor showed that the only closed two-dimensional affine manifolds are tori and Klein bottles (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

The main unsolved question about affine manifolds is whether in general an affine manifold has Euler characteristic zero. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Conjecture. Every three-manifold with finite fundamental group has an elliptic structure. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

If G is the group of isometries of Euclidean space E n , then a (G, E n )-manifold is called a Euclidean manifold, or often a flat manifold. Bieberbach proved that a Euclidean manifold is finitely covered by a torus. Furthermore, a Euclidean structure automatically gives an affine structure, and Bieberbach proved that closed Euclidean manifolds with the same fundamental group are equivalent as affine manifolds. If G is the group O(n + 1) acting on elliptic space Pn (or on S n ), then we obtain elliptic manifolds. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

This conjecture is a stronger version of the Poincaré conjecture; we shall see the logic shortly. All known three-manifolds with finite fundamental group certainly have elliptic structures.

For instance, any surface of negative Euler characteristic has a hyperbolic structure (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

R. Riley showed that the figure-eight knot complement has a hyperbolic structure ( (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

. For example, if G is the trivial group and X is closed then closed (G, X)-manifolds are precisely the finite-sheeted covers of X, and D is the covering projection.

Definition. M is a complete (G, X)-manifold if D : ̃ M̃ → X is a covering map. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

If X is similarly connected, then any complete (G, X)-manifold M may easily be reconstructed from the image Γ = H(π1 (M )) of the holonomy, as the quotient space X/Γ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Proposition 3.6. Let G be a group of analytic diffeomorphisms acting transitively on a manifold X, such that for any x ∈ X, the isotropy group Gx of x is compact. Then every closed (G, X)-manifold M is complete. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

If M is any closed (G, X)-manifold, then there is some ǫ > 0 such that the ǫ-ball in the Riemannian metric on M is always convex and contractible (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

For example, any closed elliptic three-manifold has universal cover S 3 , so any simply-connected elliptic manifold is S 3 . Every closed hyperbolic manifold or Euclidean manifold has universal cover hyperbolic three-space or Euclidean space. Such manifolds are consequently determined by their holonomy (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

A hyperbolic structure can be obtained by gluing two ideal triangles (with all vertices on the circle at infinity) in this pattern (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Similarly, if X is a point on the sphere at infinity, the horospheres “centered” at X are the surfaces orthogonal to all lines through X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 48</a>)</p>
One property which can be used to determine the spheres centered at a point X is the fact that such a sphere is orthogonal to all lines through X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

To analyze what happens near the vertices of an ideal polyhedron when it is glued together, we need the notion of horospheres (or, in the hyperbolic plane, they are called horocycles.) A horosphere has the limiting shape of a sphere in hyperbolic space, as the radius goes to infinity (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 48</a>)</p>
From this picture one easily sees that a horosphere in H n is isometric to Euclidean space E n−1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

. It is easy to see from the Gauss-Bonnet theorem that any similarity two-manifold has Euler characteristic zero.

Theorem 4.7. Every manifold obtained by Dehn surgery along the figure-eight knot K has a hyperbolic structure, except the six manifolds: (S 3 − K)(µ,λ) = (S 3 − K)(±µ,±λ) where (µ, λ) is (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1) or (4, 1).

The statement of the theorem is meant to suggest, but not imply, the true fact that the six exceptions do not have hyperbolic structures (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Definition 4.8.1. A codimension-k foliation of an n-manifold M is a G-structure, on M , where G is the pseudogroup of local homeomorphisms of Rn−k ×Rk which 4.23 have the local form φ(x, y) = (f (x, y), g(y)). In other words, G takes horizontal (n − k)-planes to horizontal (n − k)-planes. In other words, G takes horizontal (n − k)-planes to horizontal (n − k)-planes. These horizontal planes piece together in M as (n − k)-submanifolds, called the leaves of the foliation. M , like a book without its cover, is a disjoint union of its leaves.

Any three-manifold with a complete codimension-2 hyperbolic foliation has universal cover H 2 × R, and covering transformations act as global isometries in the first coordinate (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

A Seifert fibration of a three-manifold M is a projection p : M → B to some surface B, so that p is a submersion and the preimages of points are circles in M . A Seifert fibration is a fibration except at a certain number of singular points x1 , . . . , xk . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

The model for the behavior in p −1 (Nǫ (xi )) is a solid torus with a foliation having the core circle as one leaf, and with all other leaves winding p times around the short way and q times around the long way, where 1 < p < q and (p, q) = 1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

A discrete group Γ of orientation-preserving isometries of a surface N has quotient N/Γ a surface (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

prove the following: Proposition 4.9.3. If g : H 2 → H 2 is a non-trivial isometry of H 2 which preserves orientation, then exactly one of the following cases occurs: (i) g has a unique interior fixed point or (ii) g leaves a unique invariant geodesic or (iii) g has a unique fixed point on the boundary of H 2 . Case (i) is called elliptic, case (ii) hyperbolic, case (iii) parabolic (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Then S is incompressible if every loop (simple closed curve) on S which bounds an (open) disk in M − S also bounds a disk in S. Some people prefer the alternate, stronger definition that S is (strongly) incompressible if π1 (S) injects into π1 (M ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

If M is oriented and irreducible (every two-sphere bounds a ball), then M is sufficiently large if it contains an incompressible and ∂-incompressible surface. A 4.39 compact, oriented, irreducible, sufficiently large three-manifold is also called a Hakenmanifold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 82</a>)</p>
The only previously known examples are certain Seifert fibered spaces over S 2 with three exceptional fibers. In what follows we give the first known examples of compact, irreducible three-manifolds which are not Haken-manifolds and are not Seifert fiber spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 82</a>)</p>
Theorem 4.11. Every incompressible and ∂-incompressible connected surface in M is isotopic to one of S1 through S6 . Corollary. The Dehn surgery manifold M(m,l) is irreducible, and it is a Hakenmanifold if and only if (m, l) = (0, ±1) or (±4, ±1). In particular, none of the hyperbolic manifolds obtained from M by Dehn surgery is sufficiently large. (Compare 4.7.) Thus we have an infinite family of examples of oriented, irreducible, non-Haken-manifolds which are not Seifert fiber spaces. It seems likely that Dehn surgery along other knots and links would yield many more examples. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

In this section we will derive some information about the global structure of the space of hyperbolic structures on a closed, oriented surface M . This space is called the Teichmüller space of M and is defined to be the set of hyperbolic structures on M where two are equivalent if there is an isometry homotopic to the identity between them. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P.

A distinction is often made between “loxodromic” and “hyperbolic” transformations in dimension 3. In this usage a loxodromic transformation means an isometry which is a pure translation along a geodesic followed by a non-trivial twist, while a hyperbolic transformation means a pure translation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Proposition 5.3.1. On any closed hyperbolic n-manifold M there is a unique, closed geodesic in any non-trivial free homotopy class (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Now we are in a position to describe the Teichmüller space for a closed surface. The coordinates given below are due to Nielsen and Fenchel. Pick 3g − 3 disjoint, non-parallel simple closed curves on M 2 . (This is the maximum number of such curves on a surface of genus g.) Take the corresponding geodesics and cut along them. This divides M 2 into 2g − 2 surfaces homeomorphic to S 2 —three disks (called “pairs of pants” from now on) with geodesic boundary. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Proposition 5.3.2. Two distinct geodesics in the universal cover H n of M which are invariant by two covering translations have distinct endpoints at ∞. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P.

This information leads to an easy computation of the Teichmüller space of P . Proposition 5.3.4. T(P ) is homeomorphic to R3 with coordinates (log l1 , log l2 , log l3 ), where li = length of the i-th boundary component. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Remark. If a hyperbolic surface is cut along a closed geodesic and glued back together with a twist of 2πn degrees (n an integer), then the resulting surface is isometric to the original one. However, the isometry is not isotopic to the identity so the two surfaces represent distinct points in Teichmüller space. Another way to say this is that they are isometric as surfaces but not as marked surfaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Theorem 5.3.5. The Teichmüller space T(M ) of a closed surface of genus g is homeomorphic to R6g−6 . There are explicit coordinates for T(M ), namely (log l1 , τ1 , log l2 , τ2 , . . . , log l3g−3 , τ3g−3 ), where li is the length and τi the twist coefficient for a system of 3g − 3 simple closed 5.13 geodesics.

The definition of Teichmüller space can be extended to general surfaces as the space of all metrics of constant curvature up to isotopy and change of scale. In the case of the torus T 2 , this space is the set of all Euclidean structures (i.e., metrics with constant curvature zero) on T 2 with area one (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Geometric Corollary 5.4.2. Any complete hyperbolic manifold M 3 whose fundamental group is generated by two elements a and b admits an involution s (an isometry of order 2 ) which takes a to a−1 and b to b−1 . If the generators are conjugate, there is a Z2 ⊕ Z2 action on M generated by s together with an involution t which interchanges a and b unless a and b have a common fixed point at infinity.

Remark. Actually, it can be shown that when ∂M 6= 0, a representation ρ : π1 M → PSL(2, C) is the holonomy of some hyperbolic structure for M if and only if it lifts to a representation in SL(2, C). (The obstruction to lifting is the second Stiefel–Whitney class ω2 of the associated H 3 -bundle over M .) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Suppose Γ1 and Γ2 are two discrete subgroups of the group of isometries of H n , n ≥ 3 such that H n /Γi has two discrete subgroups of the group of isometries of H n , n ≥ 3 such that H n /Γi has finite volume and suppose φ : Γ1 → Γ2 is a group isomorphism. Then Γ1 and Γ2 are conjugate subgroups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

This theorem can be restated in terms of hyperbolic manifolds since a hyperbolic manifold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Since the universal cover of a hyperbolic manifold is H n , it is a K(π, 1). Two such manifolds are homotopy equivalent if and only if there is an isomorphism between their fundamental groups. Corollary 5.7.3. If M1 and M2 are hyperbolic manifolds which are complete with finite volume, then they are homeomorphic if and only if they are homotopy equivalent. (The case of dimension two is well known.) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

For any manifold M , there is a homomorphism Diff M → Out(π1 M ), where Out(π1 M ) = Aut(π1 M )/ Inn(π1 M ) is the group of outer automorphisms. Mostow’s Theorem implies this homomorphism splits, if M is a hyperbolic manifold of dimension n ≥ 3. It is unknown whether the homomorphism splits when M is a surface. sion n ≥ 3. It is unknown whether the homomorphism splits when M is a surface. When n = 2 the kernel Diff 0 (M ) is contractible, provided χ(M ) ≤ 0. If M is a Haken 5.31 three-manifold which is not a Seifert fiber space, Hatcher has shown that Diff 0 M is contractible. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Corollary 5.7.4. If M n is hyperbolic (complete, with finite total volume) and n ≥ 3, then Out(π1 M ) is a finite group, isomorphic to the group of isometries of M n .

Remark. This result contrasts with the case n = 2 where Out(π1 M 2 ) is infinite and quite interesting. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Recall the operation of generalized Dehn surgery on M (§4.5); it is parametrized 5.33 by an ordered pair of real numbers (ai , bi ) for each end which describes how to glue a solid torus to each boundary component. If nothing is glued in, this is denoted by ∞ so that the parameters can be thought of as belonging to S 2 (i.e., the one point ∞ so that the parameters can be thought of as belonging to S 2 (i.e., the one point compactification of R2 ≈ H1 (T 2 , R)). The resulting space is denoted by Md1 ,...,dk where di = (ai , bi ) or ∞. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

In this section we see that the new spaces often admit hyperbolic structures (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Theorem 5.8.2.

Given two closed hyperbolic manifolds M1 and M2 , together with an isomorphism of their fundamental groups, there is a homotopy equivalence inducing the isomorphism since M1 and M2 are K(π, 1)’s (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Definition. A map g : X → Y between metric spaces is a pseudo-isometry if Definition. A map g : X → Y between metric spaces is a pseudo-isometry if there are constants c1 , c2 such that c−1 1 d(x1 , x2 ) − c2 ≤ d(gx1 , gx2 ) ≤ c1 d(x1 , x2 ) for all x1 , x2 ∈ X.

homeomorphism of a metric space X to itself, f is K-quasi-conformal if and only if for all z ∈ X lim r→0 sup x,y∈Sr (z) d (f (x), f (y)) inf x,y∈Sr (z) d (f (x), f (y)) ≤K where Sr (Z) is the sphere of radius r around Z, and x and y are diametrically opposite. K measures the deviation of f from conformality, is equal to 1 if f is conformal, and is unchanged under composition with a conformal map. f is called quasi-conformal if it is K-quasi-conformal for some K.

If f is a 5.46 homeomorphism of a metric space X to itself, f is K-quasi-conformal if and (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Theorem 5.9.7. A quasi-conformal map of an n − 1-manifold, n > 2, has a derivative almost everywhere (= a.e.). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Theorem 5.9.8. For a closed, hyperbolic n-manifold M , π1 M acts ergodically on n−1 S∞ , i.e., every measurable, invariant set has zero measure or full measure. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P.

Since π1 M1 acts on n−1 S∞ conformally and e is invariant under conformal maps, e is a measurable, π1 M1 n−1 invariant function on S∞ . However, such functions are very simple because of the following theorem: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

n−1 Theorem 5.9.10. π1 (M ) acts ergodically on S∞ n−1 n−1 ∞ × S∞ . Remark. This theorem is equivalent to the fact that the geodesic flow of M is n−1 ergodic since pairs of distinct points on S∞ are in a one-to-one correspondence to n geodesics in H (whose endpoints are those points).

Now one must again invoke the theorem, from analysis, that a quasi-conformal map whose derivative is conformal a.e. is conformal in the usual sense; it is a spheren−1 preserving map of S∞ , so it extends to an isometry I of H n . The isometry I conjugates the action of π1 M1 to the action of π1 M2 , completing the proof of Mostow’s Theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Lemma 5.10.1 (The Margulis Lemma). For every dimension n there is an ǫ > 0 such that for every discrete group Γ of isometries of H n and for every x ∈ H n , Γ′ǫ (x) is abelian and Γǫ (x) has an abelian subgroup of finite index. Remark. This proposition is much more general than stated; if “abelian” is replaced by “nilpotent,” it applies in general to discrete groups of isometries of Riemannian manifolds with bounded curvature. The proof of the general statement is essentially the same (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

describes the structure of the set of all complete hyperbolic three-manifolds with volume bounded by a constant C: Theorem 5.11.2 (Jørgensen’s theorem [first version]). Let C > 0 be any constant. Among all complete hyperbolic three-manifolds with volume ≤ C, there are only finitely many homeomorphism types of M[ǫ,∞) . In other words, there is a link Lc in S 3 such that every complete hyperbolic manifold with volume ≤ C is obtained by Dehn surgery along LC . (The limiting case of deleting components of LC to obtain a non-compact manifold is permitted.) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

With somewhat more effort, we obtain Jørgensen’s theorem, which beautifully describes the structure of the set of all complete hyperbolic three-manifolds with (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Any two hyperbolic manifolds M and N such that M[ǫ,∞) = N[ǫ,∞) can be obtained from one another by Dehn surgery. All manifolds with volume ≤ C can therefore be obtained from a fixed finite set of manifolds by Dehn surgery on a fixed link in each manifold. Each member of this set can be obtained by Dehn surgery on some link in S 3 , so all manifolds with volume ≤ C can be obtained from S 3 by Dehn surgery on the disjoint union of all the relevant links (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

This notion of geometric nearness gives a topology to the set H of isometry classes of complete hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

üller space. Mostow’s Theorem implies that every closed manifold M in H is an isolated point, since M[ǫ,∞) = M when ǫ is small enough (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

On the other hand, a manifold in H with one end or cusp is a limit point, by the hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem 5.9. A manifold with two ends is a limit point of limit points and a manifold with k ends is a k-fold limit point (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Thus we obtain the inequality area ( ∂ solid torus) volume (solid torus) = 1 2 sinh r0 cosh r0 < 1 2 . The limiting case as r0 → ∞ can be computed similarly; the ratio is 1/2. Applying 5.61 this to M , we have 1 5.11.2. volume (M ) ≤ volume (M[ǫ,∞) ) + 2 area (∂M[ǫ,∞) ). It follows easily that v is a continuous function on H. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P.

Theorem 5.12.1. The function v : H → R+ is proper. In other words, every sequence in H with bounded volume has a convergent subsequence. For every C, there is a finite set M1 , . . . , Mk of complete hyperbolic manifolds with volume ≤ C there is a finite set M1 , . . . , Mk of complete hyperbolic manifolds with volume ≤ C such that all other complete hyperbolic manifolds with volume ≤ C are obtained from this set by the process of hyperbolic Dehn surgery (as in 5.9). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P.

Note. Gromov proved that in dimensions n 6= 3, there is only a finite number of complete hyperbolic manifolds with volume less than a given constant. He proved this more generally for negatively curved Riemannian manifolds with curvature varying between two negative constants. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=132" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 132</a>)</p>
Gromov also gave a weaker version of hyperbolic Dehn surgery, 5.8.2: he showed that many of the manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery can be given metrics of negative curvature close to −1. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P.

Any k-chain c can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the basis elements. Define the norm kck of c to be the sum of the absolute values of its coefficients, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Gromov’s norm on the real singular homology (really it is only a pseudo-norm) is obtained from this norm on cycles by passing to homology: if a ∈ Hk (X; R) is any homology class, then the norm of α is defined to be the infimum of the norms of cycles representing α, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

In particular, the norm of the fundamental class of a closed oriented manifold M gives a characteristic number of M , Gromov’s invariant of M , satisfying the inequality that for any map f : M1 → M2 , 6.1.3. k [M1 ] k ≥ | deg f | k [M2 ] k. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P.

6.1. Gromov’s invariant Let X be any topological space. Denote the real singular chain complex of X by C ∗ (k). (Recall that Ck (X) is the vector space with a basis consisting of all continuous maps of the standard simplex ∆k into X.) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Example. The n-sphere n ≥ 1 admits maps f : S n → S n of degree 2 (and higher). As a consequence of 6.1.2 k [S n ] k = 0. More explicitly, one may picture a sequence {zi } representing the fundamental class of S 1 , where zi is ( il )σi and σi wraps a 1-simplex i times around S 1 . Since kzi k = 1i , k [S 1 ] k = 0. As a trivial example, k [S 0 ] k = 2. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

For k = 2, there is only one ideal simplex up to isometry. We have seen that 2 copies of the ideal triangle fit inside a compact surface (§3.9). Thus it has finite volume, which equals π by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

When k = 3, there is an efficient formula for the computation of the volume of an ideal 3-simplex; see Milnor’s discussion of volumes in chapter 7.

It is conjectured that in general, vk is the volume of the regular ideal k-simplex; if so, Milnor has computations for more values, and a good asymptotic formula as k → ∞.

Intuitively, Gromov’s norm measures the efficiency with which multiples of a homology class can be represented by simplices. A complicated homology class needs many simplices.

For any manifold M , let C 1 (∆k , M ) denote the space of maps of ∆k to M , with the C 1 topology. We define a new notion of chains, where a k-chain is a Borel measure µ on C 1 (∆K , M ) with compact support total variation of a measure µ is kµk = sup{ of chains, wher port R and bounde f dµ | |f | ≤ 1}.

Gromov gave a very quick proof of Mostow’s theorem for hyperbolic three-manifolds, based on 6.2.

If M is a manifold and A ⊂ M a submanifold, the relative chain group Ck (M, A) is defined to be the quotient Ck (M )/Ck (A).

Gromov’s invariant of a compact, oriented norm kγk of a homology class γ ∈ Hk (M, A) is defined, as before, to be the infimal norm of relative cycles representing γ.

For any finite sheeted covering space p : M̃ → M there is a canonical chain map, transfer: C∗ (M ) → C∗ (M̃ ). The transfer of a singular simplex is simply the average of its lifts to ̃ M̃ ; this extends in an obvious way to measures on singular simplices.

With 6.5.5 combined with 6.5.2, one can compute Gromov’s invariant for any manifold which is obtained from Seifert fiber spaces and complete hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume by identifying along incompressible tori.

Closed oriented surfaces can be arranged very neatly in a single sequence, in terms of their Euler characteristic. What happens when we arrange all hyperbolic three-manifolds in terms of their volume? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

follows that the set of volumes is a closed subset of R+ . Furthermore, by combining Jørgensen’s theorem with the relative version of Gromov’s theorem, 6.5.4, we obtain Corollary 6.6.1. The set of volumes of hyperbolic three-manifolds is well-ordered. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

a convergent sequence of manifolds with non-increasing volume must be eventually constant. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

In view of these results, the volumes of complete hyperbolic manifolds are indexed by countable ordinals. In other words, there is a smallest volume v1 , a next smallest volume v2 , and so forth. This sequence v1 < v2 < v3 < · · · < vk < · · · has a limit point vω , which is the smallest volume of a complete hyperbolic manifold with one cusp.

It would be very interesting if a computer study could determine some of the low volumes, such as v1 , v2 , vω , vω2 . It seems plausible that some of these might come from Dehn surgery on the Borromean rings. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

There is some constant C such that every manifold with k cusps has volume ≥ C ·k. This follows from the analysis in 5.11.2: the number of boundary components of M[ǫ, ∞) is bounded by the number of disjoint ǫ/2 balls which can fit in M . It would be interesting to calculate or estimate the best constant C (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Corollary 6.6.3. The set of values of Gromov’s invariant k [ ] k0 on the class of connected manifolds obtained from Seifert fiber spaces and complete hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume by identifying along incompressible tori is a closed wellordered subset of R+ , with order type ω ω . We shall see later (§ ) that this class contains all Haken manifolds with toral boundaries. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Definition 6.7.1. If Γ1 and Γ2 are two discrete subgroups of isometries of H n , then Γ1 is commensurable with Γ2 if Γ1 is conjugate (in the group of isometries of H n ) to a group Γ′1 1 such that Γ′ ∩ Γ2 has finite index in Γ′1 and in Γ2 . Definition 6.7.2. Two manifolds M1 and M2 are commensurable if they have finited sheeted covers ̃ M̃1 and ̃ M̃2 which are homeomorphic. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Example 6.7.3. If W is the Whitehead link and B is the Borromean rings, then S 3 − W has a four-sheeted cover homeomorphic with a two sheeted cover of S 3 − B: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Proposition 6.7.3. If M1 is a complete hyperbolic manifold with finite volume and M2 is commensurable with M1 , then M2 is homotopy equivalent to a complete hyperbolic manifold. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=154" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 154</a>)</p>
Waldhausen proved that two Haken manifolds which are homotopy equivalent are homeomorphic, so this would follow whenever M1 is Haken. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=155" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 155</a>)</p>
so this would follow whenever M1 is Haken. There are some sorts of properties of three-manifolds which do not change under passage to a finite-sheeted cover. For this reason (and for its own sake) it would be interesting to have a better understanding of the commensurability relation among three-manifolds. This is difficult to approach from a purely topological point of view, but there is a great deal of information about commensurability given by a hyperbolic structure. For instance, in the case of a complete non-compact (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

hyperbolic three-manifold M of finite volume, each cusp gives a canonical Euclidean structure on a torus, well-defined up to similarity (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

Proposition 6.7.4. If Γ is a discrete subgroup of PSL(2, C) such that H 3 /Γ has finite volume, then Γ is conjugate to a group of matrices whose entries are algebraic (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P. Thurston/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds (513)/The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds - William P. Thurston.pdf#page=156" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 156</a>)</p>
One can ask the more subtle question, whether all entries can be made algebraic integers. Hyman Bass has proved the following remarkable result regarding this question: Theorem 6.7.5 (Bass). Let M be a complete hyperbolic three-manifold of finite volume. Then either π1 (M ) is conjugate to a subgroup of PSL(2, O), where O is the ring of algebraic integers, or M contains a closed incompressible surface (not homotopic to a cusp).

Thurston.pdf#page=156" target="_blank">William P. Thurston 156</a>)</p>
. As an example, very few knot complements seem to contain non-trivial closed incompressible surfaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

If two manifolds are commensurable, then their volumes have a rational ratio. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

From Milnor’s formula (6), p. 7.15, for the volume, we can compute some values. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/William P.

After localizing at the prime p one considers S 0 → Spp (S 0 ) → Spp 2 (S 0 ) → · · · and (3.5.16) H ← S 0 ← Σ−1 Spp (S 0 )/S 0 ← Σ−2 Spp 2 (S 0 )/Spp (S 0 ) ← · · · . Whitehead conjectured that this diagram induces an long exact sequence of homotopy groups. In particular, the map Σ−1 Spp (S 0 )/S 0 → S 0 shouls induce a surjection in homotopy in positive dimensions; this is the famous theorem of Kahn surjection in homotopy in positive dimensions; this is the famous theorem of Kahn and Priddy (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

In Section 4 we set up the Adams–Novikov spectral sequence and use it to compute the stable homotopy groups of spheres through a middling range of dimensions, namely ≤ 24 for p = 2 and ≤ 2p3 − 2p − 1 for p > 2. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C. Ravenel/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres (569)/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Grou - Douglas C.

The main results are Quillen’s theorem 4.1.6, which identifies π∗ (M U ) with the Lazard ring L (A2.1.8); the Landweber–Novikov theorem 4.1.11, which describes M U∗ (M U ); the Brown– Peterson theorem 4.1.12, which gives the spectrum BP ; and the Quillen–Adams theorem 4.1.19, which describes BP∗ (BP (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

We begin by informally defining the spectrum M U . For more details see Milnor and Stasheff [5]. Recall that for each n ≥ 0 the group of complex unitary n × n matrices U (n) has a classifying space BU (n). It has a complex n-plane bundle γn over it which is universal in the sense that any such bundle ξ over a paracompact space X is the pullback of γn , induced by a map f : X → BU (n). Isomorphism classes of such bundles ξ are in one-to-one correspondence with homotopy classes of classes of such bundles ξ are in one-to-one correspondence with homotopy classes of maps from X to BU (n). Any Cn -bundle ξ has an associated disc bundle D(ξ) and sphere bundle S(ξ). The Thom space T (ξ) is the quotient D(ξ)/S(ξ). Alternatively, for compact X, T (ξ) is the one-point compactification of the total space of ξ. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C. Ravenel/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres (569)/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Grou - Douglas C. Ravenel.pdf#page=123" target="_blank">Douglas C. Ravenel 123</a>)</p>
M U (n) is T (γn ), the Thom space of the universal n-plane bundle γn over BU (n). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C. Ravenel/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres (569)/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Grou - Douglas C. Ravenel.pdf#page=123" target="_blank">Douglas C. Ravenel 123</a>)</p>
It follows from the celebrated theorem of Thom [1] that π∗ (M U ) is isomorphic to the complex cobordisrn ring (see Milnor [4]) which is defined as follow (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C. Ravenel/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres (569)/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Grou - Douglas C. Ravenel.pdf#page=124" target="_blank">Douglas C. Ravenel 124</a>)</p>
A stably complex manifold is one with a complex structure on its stable normal bundle. (This notion of a complex manifold is weaker than others, e.g., algebraic, analytic, and almost complex.) All such manifolds are oriented. Two closed stably complex manifolds M1 and M2 are cobordant if there is a stably complex manifold W whose boundary is the disjoint union of M1 (with the opposite of the given orientation) and M2 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C. Ravenel/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres (569)/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Grou - Douglas C. Ravenel.pdf#page=124" target="_blank">Douglas C. Ravenel 124</a>)</p>
Milnor and Novikov’s calculation of π∗ (M U ) (3.1.5) implies that two such manifolds are cobordant if they have the same Chern numbers. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C. Ravenel/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres (569)/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Grou - Douglas C. Ravenel.pdf#page=124" target="_blank">Douglas C. Ravenel 124</a>)</p>
On the other hand, the connection with formal group laws (A2.1.1) discovered by Quillen [2] (see 4.1.6) is essential to all that follows. This leads one to suspect that there is some unknown formal group theoretic construction of M U or its associated infinite loop space. For example, many well-known infinite loop spaces have been constructed as classifying spaces of certain types of categories (see Adams [9], section 2.6), but to our knowledge no such description exists for M U .

4.1.1. Definition. Let E be an associative commutative ring spectrum. A complex orientation for E is a class 1 E(CP ) xE ∈ E e ≃E e 2 (S e 2 (CP ∞ ) whose restriction to E = π0 (E) is 1, where CP e E(CP 1 )≃Ee 2 (S 2 ) ∼ = π0 (E) n denotes n-dimensional complex projective space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

Recall that M U is built up out of Thom spaces M U (n) of complex vector bundles over BU (n) and that the map BU (n) → M U (n) is an equivalence when n = 1. The composition is an equivalence when n = (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

Alternatively, xM U could be defined to be the first Conner–Floyd Chern class of the canonical complex line bundle over CP ∞ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

Hence a complex orientation xE leads to a formal group law FE over E ∗ (pt.). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

The spectrum BP is named after Brown and Peterson, who first constructed it via its Postnikov towe (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

Brown and Peterson [1] also showed that BP can be constructed from H (the integral Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum) by killing all of the torsion in its integral homology with Postnikov fibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C. Ravenel/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres (569)/Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Grou - Douglas C. Ravenel.pdf#page=129" target="_blank">Douglas C. Ravenel 129</a>)</p>
More recently, 0 Priddy [1] has shown that BP can be constructed from S(p) by adding local cells to kill off all of the torsion in its homotopy.

BP bears the same relation to p-typical formal group laws (A2.1.17) that M U bears to formal group laws as seen in 4.1.6 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Douglas C.

It is true in general that two spaces X and Y are homotopy equivalent if and only if there exists a third space Z containing both X and Y as deformation retracts. For the less trivial implication one can in fact take Z to be the mapping cylinder M f of any homotopy equivalence f : X →Y .

This is equivalent to saying that RP n is the quotient space of a hemisphere D n with antipodal points of ∂D n identified (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Allen Hatcher/Algebraic Topology (609)/Algebraic Topology - Allen Hatcher.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Allen Hatcher 15</a>)</p>
The sphere S n has the structure of a cell complex with just two cells, e 0 and e n , the n cell being attached by the constant map S n−1 →e0 . This is equivalent to regarding S n as the quotient space D n /∂D n . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Allen Hatcher/Algebraic Topology (609)/Algebraic Topology - Allen Hatcher.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Allen Hatcher 15</a>)</p>
Since ∂D n with antipodal points identified is just RP n−1 , we see that RP n is obtained from RP n−1 by attaching an n cell, with the quotient projection S n−1 →RPn−1 as the attaching map. It follows by induction on n that RP n has a cell complex structure e 0 ∪ e 1 ∪ ··· ∪ e n with one cell e i in each dimension i ≤ n .

Suspension. For a space X , the suspension SX is the quotient of X × I obtained by collapsing X × {0} to one point and X × {1} to another point (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Allen Hatcher/Algebraic Topology (609)/Algebraic Topology - Allen Hatcher.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Allen Hatcher 17</a>)</p>
One especially useful property of suspension is that not only spaces but also maps can be suspended. Namely, a map f : X →Y suspends to Sf : SX →SY , the quotient map of f × 11 : X × I →Y × I . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Allen Hatcher/Algebraic Topology (609)/Algebraic Topology - Allen Hatcher.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Allen Hatcher 18</a>)</p>
The smash product X ∧ Y is then defined to be the quotient X × Y /X ∨ Y . One can think of X ∧ Y as a reduced version of X × Y obtained by collapsing away the parts that are not genuinely a product, the separate factors X and Y . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Allen Hatcher/Algebraic Topology (609)/Algebraic Topology - Allen Hatcher.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">Allen Hatcher 19</a>)</p>
but one might hope that if the subspace being collapsed already has the homotopy type of a point, then collapsing it to a point might not change the homotopy type of the whole space. Here is a positive result in this direction: If (X, A) is a CW pair consisting of a CW complex X and a contractible subcomplex A , then the quotient map X →X/A is a homotopy equivalence.

Since these isomorphisms are natural, and rotations of S n−1 have degree 1 , being homotopic to the identity, while reflections have degree −1 , we see that a rotation ρ of Rn fixing x takes a generator α of Hn (Rn , Rn − {x}) to itself, ρ∗ (α) = α , while a reflection takes α to −α .

σ a ϕ = ϕ Poincaré Duality Section 3.3 239 must take a generator of Cn (M) to twice a generator α of a Z summand of Cn−1 (M) , in order for Hn (M; Zp ) to be zero for odd primes p and Z2 for p = 2 . The cellular chain α must be a cycle since 2α is a boundary and hence a cycle. It follows that the torsion subgroup of Hn−1 (M; Z) must be a Z2 generated by α . Concerning the homology of noncompact manifolds there is the following general statement. Proposition 3.29. If M is a connected noncompact n manifold, then Hi (M; R) = 0 for i ≥ n . Proof: Represent an element of Hi (M; R) by a cycle z . This has compact image in M , so there is an open set U ⊂ M containing the image of z and having compact closure U ⊂ M . Let V = M − U . Part of the long exact sequence of the triple (M, U ∪ V , V ) fits into a commutative diagram When i > n , the two groups on either side of Hi (U ∪ V , V ; R) are zero by Lemma 3.27 since U ∪ V and V are the complements of compact sets in M . Hence Hi (U; R) = 0 , so z is a boundary in U and therefore in M , and we conclude that Hi (M; R) = 0 . When i = n , the class [z] ∈ Hn (M; R) defines a section x ֏ [z]x of MR . Since M is connected, this section is determined by its value at a single point, so [z]x will be zero for all x if it is zero for some x , which it must be since z has compact image and M is noncompact. By Lemma 3.27, z then represents zero in Hn (M, V ; R) , hence also in Hn (U; R) since the first term in the upper row of the diagram above is zero when i = n , by Lemma 3.27 again. So [z] = 0 in Hn (M; R) , and therefore Hn (M; R) = 0 since [z] was an arbitrary element of this group. ⊓ ⊔ The Duality Theorem The form of Poincaré duality we will prove asserts that for an R orientable closed n manifold, a certain naturally defined map H k (M; R)→Hn−k (M; R) is an isomorphism. The definition of this map will be in terms of a more general construction called cap product, which has close connections with cup product. For an arbitrary space X and coefficient ring R , define an R bilinear cap product a : Ck (X; R)× C ℓ (X; R)→Ck−ℓ (X; R) for k ≥ ℓ by setting  σ a ϕ = ϕ σ || [v0 , ··· , vℓ ] σ || [vℓ , ··· , vk ] for σ : ∆k →X and ϕ ∈ C ℓ (X; R) .

The algebra in the skew-symmetric case is rather simple: With a suitable choice of basis, the matrix of a skew-symmetric nonsingular bilinear form over Z can be put into the standard form consisting of 2× 2 blocks 252 Chapter 3 Cohomology an isomorphism for j ≤ 2n + 1 . As with RPn , the ring structure in H ∗ (L2n+1 ; Z) is determined by the ring structure in H ∗ (L2n+1 ; Zm ) , and likewise for L∞ , where one has the slightly simpler structure H ∗ (L∞ ; Z) ≈ Z[α]/(mα) with |α| = 2 . The case of L2n+1 is obtained from this by setting αn+1 = 0 and adjoining the extra Z ≈ H 2n+1 (L2n+1 ; Z) . A different derivation of the cup product structure in lens spaces is given in Example 3E.2. Using the ad hoc notation Hfkr ee (M) for H k (M) modulo its torsion subgroup, the preceding proposition implies that for a closed orientable manifold M of dimension 2n , the middle-dimensional cup product pairing Hfnr ee (M)× Hfnr ee (M)→Z is a nonsingular bilinear form on Hfnr ee (M) . This form is symmetric or skew-symmetric according to whether n is even or odd. The algebra in the skew-symmetric case is rather simple: With a suitable choice of basis, the matrix of a skew-symmetric nonsingular bilinear form over Z can be put into the standard form consisting of 2× 2 blocks 0 −1  1 0 along the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, according to an algebra exercise at the end of the section. In particular, the rank of H n (M 2n ) must be even when n is odd. We are already familiar with these facts in the case n = 1 by the explicit computations of cup products for surfaces in §3.2. The symmetric case is much more interesting algebraically. There are only finitely many isomorphism classes of symmetric nonsingular bilinear forms over Z of a fixed rank, but this ‘finitely many’ grows rather rapidly, for example it is more than 80 million for rank 32; see [Serre 1973] for an exposition of this beautiful chapter of number theory. One can ask whether all these forms actually occur as cup product pairings in closed manifolds M 4k for a given k . The answer is yes for 4k = 4, 8, 16 but seems to be unknown in other dimensions. In dimensions 4 , 8 , and 16 one can even take M 4k to be simply-connected and have the bare minimum of homology: Z ’s in dimensions 0 and 4k and a free abelian group in dimension 2k . In dimension 4 there are at most two nonhomeomorphic simply-connected closed 4 manifolds with the same bilinear form. Namely, there are two manifolds with the same form if the square α ` α of some α ∈ H 2 (M 4 ) is an odd multiple of a generator of H 4 (M 4 ) , for example for CP2 , and otherwise the M 4 is unique, for example for S 4 or S 2 × S 2 ; see [Freedman & Quinn 1990]. In §4.C we take the first step in this direction by proving a classical result of J. H. C. Whitehead that the homotopy type of a simply-connected closed 4 manifold is uniquely determined by its cup product structure. Other Forms of Duality Generalizing the definition of a manifold, an n manifold with boundary is a Hausdorff space M in which each point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic either to Rn or to the half-space Rn n + = { (x1 , ··· , xn ) ∈ R | xn ≥ 0 } . If a point x ∈ M corresponds under such a homeomorphism to a point (x1 , ··· , xn ) ∈ Rn + with 0 1 1 0  along the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Allen Hatcher/Algebraic Topology (609)/Algebraic Topology - Allen Hatcher.pdf#page=261" target="_blank">Allen Hatcher 261</a>)</p>

The study of generalized homology and cohomology theories pervades modern algebraic topology. These theories satisfy the excision axiom. One constructs most such theories homotopically, by constructing representing objects called spectra, and one must then prove that excision holds. There is a way to do this in general that is no more difficult than the standard verification for singular homology and cohomology. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Define r(x) ∈ S 1 to be the intersection with S 1 of the ray that starts at f (x) and passes through x. Certainly r(x) = x if x ∈ S 1 .

Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)</p>
For example, if F : S −→ A b is the functor that sends a set to the free Abelian group that it generates and U : A b −→ S is the forgetful functor that sends an Abelian group to its underlying set, then we have a natural inclusion of sets S −→ U F (S). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)</p>
The functors F and U are left adjoint and right adjoint to each other, in the sense that we have a natural isomorphism A b(F (S), A) ∼ = ∼ = S (S, U (A)) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)</p>
for a set S and an Abelian group A. This just expresses the “universal property” of free objects: a map of sets S −→ U (A) extends uniquely to a homomorphism of groups F (S) −→ A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J.

The fundamental group is a homotopy invariant functor on T , in the sense that it factors through a functor hT −→ G . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)</p>
When we have a (suitable) relation of homotopy between maps in a category C , we define the homotopy category hC to be the category with the same objects as C but with morphisms the homotopy classes of maps (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)</p>
A homotopy equivalence in U is an isomorphism in hU . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)</p>
Less mysteriously, a map f : X −→ Y is a homotopy equivalence if there is a map g : Y −→ X such that both g ◦ f ≃ id and f ◦ g ≃ id. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)</p>
Functors carry isomorphisms to isomorphisms, so we see that a based homotopy equivalence induces an isomorphism of fundamental groups. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)</p>
Proposition. If f : X −→ Y is a homotopy equivalence, then f∗ : π1 (X, x) −→ π1 (Y, f (x)) is an isomorphism for all x ∈ X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">J. Peter May 22</a>)</p>
A space X is said to be contractible if it is homotopy equivalent to a point. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=23" target="_blank">J. Peter May 23</a>)</p>
For this purpose, we define the “fundamental groupoid” Π(X) of a space X to be the category whose objects are the points of X and whose morphisms x −→ y are the equivalence classes of paths from x to y. Thus the set of endomorphisms of the object x is exactly the fundamental group π1 (X, x). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=23" target="_blank">J. Peter May 23</a>)</p>
The term “groupoid” is used for a category all morphisms of which are isomorphisms. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=23" target="_blank">J. Peter May 23</a>)</p>
There is a useful notion of a skeleton skC of a category C . This is a “full” subcategory with one object from each isomorphism class of objects of C , “full” meaning that the morphisms between two objects of skC are all of the morphisms between these objects in C . The inclusion functor J : skC −→ C is an equivalence of categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=23" target="_blank">J. Peter May 23</a>)</p>
Let D be a small category and let C be any category. A D-shaped diagram in C is a functor F : D −→ C . A morphism F −→ F ′ of D-shaped diagrams is a natural transformation, and we have the category D[C ] of D-shaped diagrams in C (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">J. Peter May 24</a>)</p>
The colimit, colim F , of a D-shaped diagram F is an object of C together with a morphism of diagrams ι : F −→ colim F that is initial among all such morphisms. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">J. Peter May 24</a>)</p>
This means that if η : F −→ A is a morphism of diagrams, then there is a unique map η̃ : colim F −→ A in C such that η̃ ◦ ι = η. Diagrammatically, this property is expressed by the assertion that, for each map d : D −→ D′ in D, we have a commutative diagram F (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">J. Peter May 24</a>)</p>
The limit of F is defined by reversing arrows: it is an object lim F of C together with a morphism of diagrams π : lim F −→ F that is terminal among all such morphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">J. Peter May 24</a>)</p>
If D is a set regarded as a discrete category (only identity morphisms), then colimits and limits indexed on D are coproducts and products indexed on the set D. Coproducts are disjoint unions in S or U , wedges (or one-point unions) in T , free products in G , and direct sums in A b. Products are Cartesian products in all of these categories; more precisely, they are Cartesian products of underlying sets, with additional structure. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">J. Peter May 24</a>)</p>
If D is the category displayed schematically as eo /f or // d′ , d d where we have displayed all objects and all non-identity morphisms, then the colimits indexed on D are called pushouts or coequalizers, respectively. Similarly, if D is displayed schematically as e /do f or // d′ , d (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">J. Peter May 24</a>)</p>
then the limits indexed on D are called pullbacks or equalizers, respectively (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">J. Peter May 25</a>)</p>
A category is said to be cocomplete if it has all colimits, complete if it has all limits. The categories S , U , T , G , and A b are complete and cocomplete. If a category has coproducts and coequalizers, then it is cocomplete, and similarly for completeness. The proof is a worthwhile exercise. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">J. Peter May 25</a>)</p>
The proof well illustrates how to manipulate colimits formally. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">J. Peter May 25</a>)</p>
Any compact surface is homeomorphic to a sphere, or to a connected sum of tori T 2 = S 1 × S 1 , or to a connected sum of projective planes RP 2 = S 2 /Z2 (where we write Z2 = Z/2Z) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma. For based spaces X and Y , π1 (X × Y ) ∼ = ∼ = π1 (X) × π1 (Y ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">J. Peter May 28</a>)</p>
Proposition. Let X = U ∪V , where U , V , and U ∩V are path connected open neighborhoods of the basepoint of X and V is simply connected. Then π1 (U ) −→ π1 (X) is an epimorphism whose kernel is the smallest normal subgroup of π1 (U ) that contains the image of π1 (U ∩ V ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We shall later use the following application of the van Kampen theorem to prove that any group is the fundamental group of some space. We need a definition. Definition. A space X is said to be simply connected if it is path connected and satisfies π1 (X) = 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

However, I know of no published source for the use that we shall make of the orbit category O(π1 (B, b)) in the classification of coverings of a space B (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This point of view gives us the opportunity to introduce some ideas that are central to equivariant algebraic topology, the study of spaces with group actions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

While the reader is free to think about locally contractible spaces, weaker conditions are appropriate for the full generality of the theory of covering spaces. A space X is said to be locally path connected if for any x ∈ X and any neighborhood U of x, there is a smaller neighborhood V of x each of whose points can be connected to x by a path in U . This is equivalent to the seemingly more stringent requirement that the topology of X have a basis consisting of path connected open sets. In fact, if X is locally path connected and U is an open neighborhood of a point x, then the set V = {y | y can be connected to x by a path in U } is a path connected open neighborhood of x that is contained in U (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Observe that if X is connected and locally path connected, then it is path connected (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">J. Peter May 29</a>)</p>
Definition. A map p : E −→ B is a covering (or cover, or covering space) if it is surjective and if each point b ∈ B has an open neighborhood V such that each component of p−1 (V ) is open in E and is mapped homeomorphically onto V by p (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Any homeomorphism is a cover. A product of covers is a cover. The projection R −→ S 1 is a cover (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. A covering p : E −→ B is regular if p∗ (π1 (E, e)) is a normal subgroup of π1 (B, b). It is universal if E is simply connected (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

As we shall explain in §4, for a universal cover p : E −→ B, the elements of Fb are in bijective correspondence with the elements of π1 (B, b). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Example. For n ≥ 2, S n is a universal cover of RP n . Therefore π1 (RP n ) has only two elements. There is a unique group with two elements, and this proves our earlier claim that π1 (RP n ) = Z2 .

As e′ runs through Fb , the groups p∗ (π1 (E, e′ )) run through all conjugates of p∗ (π1 (E, e)) in π1 (B, b). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The category x\C of objects under x has objects the maps f : x −→ y in C ; for objects f : x −→ y and g : x −→ z, the morphisms γ : f −→ g in x\C are the morphisms γ : y −→ z in C such that γ ◦ f = g : x −→ z.

For an object b of B, let Fb denote the set of objects of E such that p(e) = b. Then p−1 (St(b)) is the disjoint union over e ∈ Fb of St(e). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. If p : E −→ B is a covering of spaces, then the induced functor Π(p) : Π(E) −→ Π(B) is a covering of groupoids (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The fibers Fb of a covering of groupoids are related by translation functions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">J. Peter May 31</a>)</p>
Proposition. Any two fibers Fb and Fb′ of a covering of groupoids have the same cardinality. Therefore any two fibers of a covering of spaces have the same cardinality.

The isotropy group Gs of a point s is the subgroup {g|gs = s} of G. An action is free if gs = s implies g = e, that is, if Gs = e for every s ∈ S. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

When G acts transitively on a set S, we obtain an isomorphism of G-sets between S and the G-set G/Gs for any fixed s ∈ S by sending gs to the coset gGs (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For a subgroup H of G, let N H denote the normalizer of H in G and define W H = N H/H. Such quotient groups W H are sometimes called Weyl groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A covering of groupoids is universal if and only if π(B, b) acts freely on Fb , and then Fb is isomorphic to π(B, b) as a π(B, b)-set. Specializing to covering spaces, this sharpens our earlier claim that the elements of Fb and π1 (B, b) are in bijective correspondence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We have given an algebraic classification of all possible covers of B: there is at most one isomorphism class of covers corresponding to each conjugacy class of subgroups of π(B, b) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We begin with the following result, which deserves to be called the fundamental theorem of covering space theory and has many other applications (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In particular, two maps of covers g, g ′ : E −→ E ′ coincide if g(e) = g ′ (e) for any one e ∈ E. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We hasten to add that the theorem above is atypical of algebraic topology. It is not usually the case that algebraic invariants like the fundamental group totally determine the existence and uniqueness of maps of topological spaces with prescribed properties (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. Let p : E −→ B be a covering and choose b ∈ B and e ∈ Fb . Write G = π1 (B, b) and H = p∗ (π1 (E, e)). Then Aut(E) is isomorphic to the group of automorphisms of the G-set Fb and therefore to the group W H. If p is regular, then Aut(E) ∼ = ∼ = G/H. If p is universal, then Aut(E) ∼ = ∼ = G (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

We have now given an algebraic classification of all possible covers of B: there is at most one isomorphism class of covers corresponding to each conjugacy class of subgroups of π1 (B, b).

We show here that all of these possibilities are actually realized. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">J. Peter May 38</a>)</p>
Again, while it suffices to think in terms of locally contractible spaces, appropriate generality demands a weaker hypothesis. We say that a space B is semi-locally simply connected if every point b ∈ B has a neighborhood U such that π1 (U, b) −→ π1 (B, b) is the trivial homomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. If B is connected, locally path connected, and semi-locally simply connected, then B has a universal cover. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. A G-space X is a space X that is a G-set with continuous action map G × X −→ X. Define the orbit space X/G to be the set of orbits {Gx|x ∈ X} with its topology as a quotient space of X.

The definition makes sense for general topological groups G. However, our interest here is in discrete groups G, for which the continuity condition just means that action by each element of G is a homeomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. Let p : E −→ B be a cover such that Aut(E) acts transitively on Fb . Then the cover p is regular and E/ Aut(E) is homeomorphic to B. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A map f : X −→ Y is said to be a local homeomorphism if every point of X has an open neighborhood that maps homeomorphically onto an open set in Y . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let X be a G-space, where G is a (discrete) group. For a subgroup H of G, define X H = {x|hx = x for all h ∈ H} ⊂ X; X H is the H-fixed point subspace of X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We define graphs, describe their homotopy types, and use them to show that a subgroup of a free group is free and that any group is the fundamental group of some space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Observe that a graph is a locally contractible space: any neighborhood of any point contains a contractible neighborhood of that point. Therefore a connected graph has all possible covers.

A graph is finite if it has only finitely many vertices and edges or, equivalently, if it is a compact space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A graph is locally finite if each vertex is a boundary point of only finitely many edges or, equivalently, if it is a locally compact space. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A subspace A of a space X is a deformation retract if there is a homotopy h : X × I −→ X such that h(x, 0) = x, h(a, t) = a, and h(x, 1) ∈ A for all x ∈ X, a ∈ A, and t ∈ I. Such a homotopy is called a deformation of X onto A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

for a suitably nice inclusion, called a “cofibration,” of a contractible space T in a space X, the quotient map X −→ X/T is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Let X be a connected graph with maximal tree T . Then the quotient space X/T is the wedge of one circle for each edge of X not in T , and the quotient map q : X −→ X/T is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

types of graphs has the following immediate implication. Corollary. If X is a connected graph, then π1 (X) is a free group with one generator for each edge not in a given maximal tree. If X is finite, then π1 (X) is free on 1 − χ(X) generators; in particular, χ(X) ≤ 1, with equality if and only if X is a tree. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. If B is a connected graph with vertex set B 0 and p : E −→ B is a covering, then E is a connected graph with vertex set E 0 = p−1 (B 0 ) and with one edge for each edge j of B and point e ∈ Fj(0) . Therefore, if B is finite and p is a finite cover whose fibers have cardinality n, then E is finite and χ(E) = nχ(B). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. A subgroup H of a free group G is free. If G is free on k generators and H has finite index n in G, then H is free on 1 − n + nk generators. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. For any group G, there is a connected space X such that π1 (X) is isomorphic to G. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Define the (unreduced) cone on E to be CE = (E × I)/(E × {1}) and define X = B ∪p CE/(∼), where (e, 0) ∼ p(e). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The space X constructed in the proof is called the “homotopy cofiber” of the map p. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">J. Peter May 46</a>)</p>
The homotopy and homology groups of spaces are supported on compact subspaces, and it turns out that if one assumes a separation property that is a little weaker than the Hausdorff property, then one can refine the point-set topology of spaces to eliminate such pathology without changing these invariants. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=47" target="_blank">J.

We shall understand compact spaces to be both compact and Hausdorff (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=47" target="_blank">J. Peter May 47</a>)</p>
A space X is said to be “weak Hausdorff” if g(K) is closed in X for every map g : K −→ X from a compact space K into X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A space X is “compactly generated” if it is a weak Hausdorff k-space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=47" target="_blank">J. Peter May 47</a>)</p>
Lemma. If X is a compactly generated space and Y is any space, then a function f : X −→ Y is continuous if and only if its restriction to each compact subspace K of X is continuous (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=47" target="_blank">J. Peter May 47</a>)</p>
A subspace A of X is said to be “compactly closed” if g −1 (A) is closed in K for any map g : K −→ X from a compact space K into X. When X is weak Hausdorff, this holds if and only if the intersection of A with each compact subset of X is closed. A space X is a “k-space” if every compactly closed subspace is closed (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=47" target="_blank">J. Peter May 47</a>)</p>
By definition, a space X is Hausdorff if the diagonal subspace ∆X = {(x, x)} is closed in X ×c X. The weak Hausdorff property admits a similar characterization. Lemma. If X is a k-space, then X is weak Hausdorff if and only if ∆X is closed in X × X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">J. Peter May 48</a>)</p>
The interpretation is that a quotient space of a compactly generated space by a “closed equivalence relation” is compactly generated (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. If X and Y are compactly generated spaces, A is a closed subspace of X, and f : A −→ Y is any continuous map, then the pushout Y ∪f X is compactly generated.

Another source of pathology is passage to colimits over sequences of maps Xi −→ Xi+1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">J. Peter May 48</a>)</p>
Proposition. If {Xi } is a sequence of compactly generated spaces and inclusions Xi −→ Xi+1 with closed images, then colim Xi is compactly generated. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">J. Peter May 48</a>)</p>
Limits of weak Hausdorff spaces are weak Hausdorff, but limits of k-spaces need not be k-spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">J. Peter May 48</a>)</p>
We construct limits of compactly generated spaces by applying the functor k to their limits as spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">J. Peter May 48</a>)</p>
Point-set level colimits of weak Hausdorff spaces need not be weak Hausdorff (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">J. Peter May 48</a>)</p>
However, if a point-set level colimit of compactly generated spaces is weak Hausdorff, then it is a k-space and therefore compactly generated. We shall only be interested in colimits in those cases where this holds. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. For spaces X, Y , and Z in U , the canonical bijection Z (X×Y ) ∼ = ∼ = (Z Y ) X is a homeomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Observe in particular that a homotopy X × I −→ Y can equally well be viewed as a map X −→ Y I (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Exact sequences that feature in the study of homotopy, homology, and cohomology groups all can be derived homotopically from the theory of cofiber and fiber sequences that we present in this and the following two chapters (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The theories of cofiber and fiber sequences illustrate an important, but informal, duality theory, known as Eckmann-Hilton duality (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It is based on the adjunction between Cartesian products and function spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">J. Peter May 51</a>)</p>
Definition. A map i : A −→ X is a cofibration if it satisfies the homotopy extension property (HEP). This means that if h ◦ i0 = f ◦ i in the diagram (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">J. Peter May 51</a>)</p>
Pushouts of cofibrations are cofibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">J. Peter May 51</a>)</p>
Namely, we can let Y in our original test diagram be the “mapping cylinder (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=52" target="_blank">J. Peter May 52</a>)</p>
As a matter of point-set topology, left as an exercise, it follows that a cofibration is an inclusion with closed image. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

M i ≡ X ∪i (A × I), which is the pushout of i and (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=52" target="_blank">J. Peter May 52</a>)</p>
We can use the mapping cylinder construction to decompose an arbitrary map f : X −→ Y as the composite of a cofibration and a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=53" target="_blank">J. Peter May 53</a>)</p>
To see this, recall that M f = Y ∪f (X × I) and observe that f coincides with the composite X j − → Mf r r − → Y, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

where j(x) = (x, 1) and where r(y) = y on Y and r(x, s) = f (x) on X × I. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=53" target="_blank">J. Peter May 53</a>)</p>
We shall often consider pairs (X, A) consisting of a space X and a subspace A. Cofibration pairs will be those pairs that “behave homologically” just like the associated quotient spaces X/A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=53" target="_blank">J.

Definition. A pair (X, A) is an NDR-pair (= neighborhood deformation retract pair) if there is a map u : X −→ I such that u−1 (0) = A and a homotopy h : X × I −→ X such that h0 = id, h(a, t) = a for a ∈ A and t ∈ I, and h(x, 1) ∈ A if u(x) < 1; (X, A) is a DR-pair if u(x) < 1 for all x ∈ X, in which case A is a deformation retract of X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=53" target="_blank">J. Peter May 53</a>)</p>
Theorem. Let A be a closed subspace of X. Then the following are equivalent: (i) (X, A) is an NDR-pair. (ii) (X × I, X × {0} ∪ A × I) is a DR-pair. (iii) X × {0} ∪ A × I is a retract of X × I. (iv) The inclusion i : A −→ X is a cofibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=53" target="_blank">J. Peter May 53</a>)</p>
It is often important to work in the category of spaces under a given space A, and we shall later need a basic result about homotopy equivalences in this category. We shall also need a generalization concerning homotopy equivalences of pairs. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">J. Peter May 54</a>)</p>
A homotopy between maps under A is a homotopy that at each time t is a map under A. We then write h : f ≃ f ′ rel A (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">J. Peter May 54</a>)</p>
A. Such an equivalence is called a “cofiber homotopy equivalence.” The name is suggested by the following result, whose proof illustrates a more substantial use of the HEP than we have seen before (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">J. Peter May 54</a>)</p>
Proposition. Let i : A −→ X and j : A −→ Y be cofibrations and let f : X −→ Y be a map such that f ◦i = j. Suppose that f is a homotopy equivalence. Then f is a cofiber homotopy equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">J.

Definition. A surjective map p : E −→ B is a fibration if it satisfies the covering homotopy property (CHP) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">J. Peter May 57</a>)</p>
This notion of a fibration is due to Hurewicz. There is a more general notion of a Serre fibration, in which the test spaces Y are restricted to be cubes I n . Serre fibrations are more appropriate for many purposes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">J. Peter May 57</a>)</p>
With this formulation, we can “dualize” the proof that pushouts of cofibrations are cofibrations to show that pullbacks of fibrations are fibrations. We often write A ×g E for the pullback of a given fibration p : E −→ B and a map g : A −→ B. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">J. Peter May 57</a>)</p>
Lemma. If p : E −→ B is a fibration and g : A −→ B is any map, then the induced map A ×g E −→ A is a fibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">J. Peter May 57</a>)</p>
Although the CHP is expressed in terms of general test diagrams, there is a certain universal test diagram. Namely, we can let Y in our original test diagram be the “mapping path space” N p ≡ E ×p B I = {(e, β)|β(0) = p(e)} ⊂ E × B I . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">J. Peter May 57</a>)</p>
In general, path lifting functions are not unique. In fact, we have already studied the special kinds of fibrations for which they are unique. Lemma. If p : E −→ B is a covering, then p is a fibration with a unique path lifting function s. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=58" target="_blank">J. Peter May 58</a>)</p>
A map s : N p −→ E I such that k ◦ s = id, where k : E I −→ N p has coordinates p0 and pI , is called a path lifting function (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma. If i : A −→ X is a cofibration and B is a space, then the induced map p = B i : B X −→ B A is a fibration. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=58" target="_blank">J. Peter May 58</a>)</p>
We can use the mapping path space construction to decompose an arbitrary map f : X −→ Y as the composite of a homotopy equivalence and a fibration. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

When restricted to the spaces U in a well chosen open cover O of the base space B, a covering is homeomorphic to the projection U × F −→ U , where F is a fixed discrete set (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">J. Peter May 59</a>)</p>
The obvious generalization of this is the notion of a bundle. A map p : E −→ B is a bundle if, when restricted to the spaces U in a well chosen open cover O of B, there are homeomorphisms φ : U × F −→ p−1 (U ) such that p ◦ φ = π1 , where F is a fixed topological space. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">J.

that every bundle is a fibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">J. Peter May 59</a>)</p>
Theorem. Let p : E −→ B be a map and let O be a numerable open cover of B. Then p is a fibration if and only if p : p−1 (U ) −→ U is a fibration for every U ∈ O.

Since pullbacks of fibrations are fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">J. Peter May 59</a>)</p>
B. A space over B is a map p : E −→ B. A map of spaces over B is a commutative diagram (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=60" target="_blank">J. Peter May 60</a>)</p>
A homotopy between maps over B is a homotopy that at each time t is a map over B. There results a notion of a homotopy equivalence over B. Such an equivalence is called a “fiber homotopy equivalence.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. Let p : D −→ B and q : E −→ B be fibrations and let f : D −→ E be a map such that q ◦ f = p. Suppose that f is a homotopy equivalence. Then f is a fiber homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

Translation of fibers along paths in the base space played a fundamental role in our study of covering spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Lifting of equivalence classes of paths in B to homotopy classes of maps of fibers specifies a functor λ : Π(B) −→ hU . Therefore, if B is path connected, then any two fibers of B are homotopy equivalent. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=62" target="_blank">J. Peter May 62</a>)</p>
Just as the fundamental group π1 (B, b) of the base space of a covering acts on the fiber Fb , so the fundamental group π1 (B, b) of the base space of a fibration acts “up to homotopy” on the fiber (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=62" target="_blank">J. Peter May 62</a>)</p>
The composite of homotopy equivalences is a homotopy equivalence, and composition defines a continuous product on Aut(X). With this product, Aut(X) is a “topological monoid,” namely a space with a continuous and associative multiplication with a two-sided identity element, but it is not a group. However, the path components of Aut(X) are the homotopy classes of homotopy equivalences of X, and these do form a group under composition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We use cofibrations and fibrations in the category T of based spaces to generate two “exact sequences of spaces” from a given map of based spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For based spaces X and Y , we let [X, Y ] denote the set of based homotopy classes of based maps X −→ Y . This set has a natural basepoint, namely the homotopy class of the constant map from X to the basepoint of Y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The appropriate analogue of the Cartesian product in the category of based spaces is the “smash product” X ∧ Y defined by X ∧ Y = X × Y /X ∨ Y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

With these definitions, we have a natural homeomorphism of based spaces F (X ∧ Y, Z) ∼ = ∼ = F (X, F (Y, Z)) for based spaces X and Y . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We define the cone on X to be CX = X ∧ I, where I is given the basepoint 1. That is, CX = X × I/({∗} × I ∪ X × {1}). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We view S 1 as I/∂I, denote its basepoint by 1, and define the suspension of X to be ΣX = X ∧ S 1 . That is, ΣX = X × S 1 /({∗} × S 1 ∪ X × {1}). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">J. Peter May 65</a>)</p>
These are sometimes called the reduced cone and suspension, to distinguish them from the unreduced constructions, in which the line {∗} × I through the basepoint of X is not identified to a point (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Dually, we define the path space of X to be P X = F (I, X), where I is given the basepoint 0. Thus the points of P X are the paths in X that start at the basepoint. We define the loop space of X to be ΩX = F (S 1 , X). Its points are the loops at the basepoint. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We have the adjunction F (ΣX, Y ) ∼ = ∼ = F (X, ΩY ). Passing to π0 , this gives that [ΣX, Y ] ∼ = ∼ = [X, ΩY ]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We say that X is “nondegenerately based,” or “well pointed,” if the inclusion of its basepoint is a cofibration in the unbased sense. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Write Y+ for the union of a space Y and a disjoint basepoint and observe that we can identify X ∧ Y+ with X × Y /{∗} × Y . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The space X ∧ I+ is called the reduced cylinder on X, and a based homotopy X × I −→ Y is the same thing as a based map X ∧ I+ −→ Y . We change notations and write M f for the based mapping cylinder Y ∪f (X ∧ I+ ) of a based map (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

As in the unbased case, we conclude that a based map i : A −→ X is a cofibration if and only if M i is a retract of X ∧ I+ . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let i : Y −→ Cf be the inclusion. It is a cofibration since it is the pushout of f and the cofibration X −→ CX that sends x to (x, 0) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

These “long exact sequences of based spaces” give rise to long exact sequences of pointed sets, where a sequence S ′ f − →S g → S − ′′ of pointed sets is said to be exact if g(s) = ∗ if and only if s = f (s′ ) for some s (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. For any based space Z, the induced sequence · · · −→ [ΣCf, Z] −→ [ΣY, Z] −→ [ΣX, Z] −→ [Cf, Z] −→ [Y, Z] −→ [X, Z] is an exact sequence of pointed sets, or of groups to the left of [ΣX, Z], or of Abelian groups to the left of [Σ2 X, Z].

For a based map f : X −→ Y , define the “homotopy fiber” F f to be F f = X ×f P Y = {(x, χ)|f (x) = χ(1)} ⊂ X × P Y.

It is often useful to know that cofiber sequences and fiber sequences can be connected to one another. The adjunction between loops and suspension has “unit” and “counit” maps η : X −→ ΩΣX and ε : ΣΩX −→ X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This is a group if n ≥ 2 and an Abelian group if n ≥ 3. Again, πn (X, A) = π0 (Ω n−1 P (X; ∗, A)). These are called relative homotopy groups. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

There are three standard bundles, called the Hopf bundles, that can be used to obtain a bit more information about the homotopy groups of spheres. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

That is, CP 1 = (C × C − {0})/(∼), where (z1 , z2 ) ∼ (λz1 , λz2 ) for complex numbers λ, z1 , and z2 . Write [z1 , z2 ] for the equivalence class of (z1 , z2 ). We obtain a homeomorphism CP 1 −→ S 2 by identifying S 2 with the one-point compactification of C and mapping [z1 , z2 ] to z2 /z1 if z1 6= 0 and to the point at ∞ if z1 = 0. The Hopf map η : S 3 −→ S 2 is specified by η(z1 , z2 ) = [z1 , z2 ], where S 3 is identified with the unit sphere in the complex plane C2 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It is left as an exercise to show that the long exact sequence associated to ν implies that π7 (S 4 ) contains an element of infinite order, and σ can be used similarly to show the same for π15 (S 8 ).

In fact, the homotopy groups πq (S n ) for q > n > 1 are all finite except for π4n−1 (S 2n ), which is the direct sum of Z and a finite group. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The difficulty of computing homotopy groups is well illustrated by the fact that there is no non-contractible simply connected compact manifold (or finite CW complex) all of whose homotopy groups are known.

We introduce a large class of spaces, called CW complexes, between which a weak equivalence is necessarily a homotopy equivalence. Thus, for such spaces, the homotopy groups are, in a sense, a complete set of invariants. Moreover, we shall see that every space is weakly equivalent to a CW complex (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma. If A is a subcomplex of a CW complex X, Y is a CW complex, and f : A −→ Y is a cellular map, then the pushout Y ∪f X is a CW complex that contains Y as a subcomplex and has one cell for each cell of X that is not in A.

In particular, if we take e to be the identity map of Y , we see that the inclusion A −→ X is a cofibration. Observe that, by passage to colimits, we are free to take n = ∞ in the theorem.

If X is a finite CW complex, in the sense that it has finitely many cells, and if dim X > 1 and X is not contractible, then it is known that X has infinitely many non-zero homotopy groups. The Whitehead theorem is thus surprisingly strong: in its first statement, if low dimensional homotopy groups are mapped isomorphically, then so are all higher homotopy groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

That is, there is a homotopy inverse map and a pair of homotopies under C. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">J. Peter May 88</a>)</p>
The fundamental obstruction to the calculation of homotopy groups is the failure of excision: for an excisive triad (X; A, B), the inclusion (A, A ∩ B) −→ (X, B) fails to induce an isomorphism of homotopy groups in general (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=91" target="_blank">J. Peter May 91</a>)</p>
However, we do have such an isomorphism in a range of dimensions. This implies the Freudenthal suspension theorem, which gives that πn+q (Σn X) is independent of n if q is small relative to n (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Homotopy excision). Let (X; A, B) be an excisive triad such that C = A ∩ B is non-empty. Assume that (A, C) is (m − 1)-connected and (B, C) is (n − 1)-connected, where m ≥ 2 and n ≥ 1. Then the inclusion (A, C) −→ (X, B) is an (m + n − 2)-equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=91" target="_blank">J. Peter May 91</a>)</p>
This specializes to give a relationship between the homotopy groups of pairs (X, A) and of quotients X/A and to prove the Freudenthal suspension theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Let f : X −→ Y be an (n−1)-equivalence between (n−2)-connected spaces, where n ≥ 2; thus πn−1 (f ) is an epimorphism. Then the quotient map π : (M f, X) −→ (Cf, ∗) is a (2n − 2)-equivalence. In particular, Cf is (n − 1)connected. If X and Y are (n − 1)-connected, then π : (M f, X) −→ (Cf, ∗) is a (2n − 1)-equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. Let f : X −→ Y be a based map between (n − 1)-connected nondegenerately based spaces, where n ≥ 2. Then Cf is (n − 1)-connected and πn (M f, X) −→ πn (Cf, ∗) is an isomorphism. Moreover, the canonical map η : F f −→ ΩCf induces an isomorphism πn−1 (F f ) −→ πn (Cf ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Let i : A −→ X be a cofibration and an (n − 1)-equivalence between (n − 2)-connected spaces, where n ≥ 2. Then the quotient map (X, A) −→ (X/A, ∗) is a (2n − 2)-equivalence, and it is a (2n − 1)-equivalence if A and X are (n − 1)connected. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A specialization of the last result gives the Freudenthal suspension theorem. For a based space X, define the suspension homomorphism Σ : πq (X) −→ πq+1 (ΣX) by letting Σf = f ∧ id : S q+1 ∼ = ∼ = S q ∧ S 1 −→ X ∧ S 1 = ΣX. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Freudenthal suspension). Assume that X is nondegenerately based and (n − 1)-connected, where n ≥ 1. Then Σ is a bijection if q < 2n − 1 and a surjection if q = 2n − 1.

Theorem. For all n ≥ 1, πn (S n ) = Z and Σ : πn (S n ) −→ πn+1 (S n+1 ) is an isomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We saw by use of the Hopf bundle S 3 −→ S 2 that π2 (S 2 ) = Z, and the suspension theorem applies to give the conclusion for n ≥ 2. A little extra argument is needed to check that Σ is an isomorphism for n = 1; one can inspect the connecting homomorphism of the Hopf bundle or refer ahead to the observation that the Hurewicz homomorphism commutes with the corresponding suspension isomorphism in homology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">J. Peter May 93</a>)</p>
The dimensional range of the suspension theorem is sharp. We saw before that π3 (S 2 ) = π3 (S 3 ), which is Z. The suspension theorem applies to show that Σ : π3 (S 2 ) −→ π4 (S 3 ) is an epimorphism, and it is known that π4 (S 3 ) = Z2 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Applying suspension repeatedly, we can form a colimit π s qs (X) = colim πq+n (Σ n X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">J. Peter May 93</a>)</p>
This group is called the qth stable homotopy group of X. For q < n − 1, the maps of the colimit system are isomorphisms and therefore π s qs (X) = πq+n (Σ n X) if q < n − 1.

The calculation of the stable homotopy groups of spheres, πqs qs (S 0 ), is one of the deepest and most studied problems in algebraic topology. Important problems of geometric topology, such as the enumeration of the distinct differential structures on S q for q ≥ 5, have been reduced to the determination of these groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

3. Proof of the homotopy excision theorem This is a deep result, and it is remarkable that a direct homotopical proof, in principle an elementary one, is possible. Most standard texts, if they treat this topic at all, give a far more sophisticated proof of a significantly weaker result. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We are trying to show that a certain map of pairs induces an isomorphism in a range of dimensions. We capture the relevant map as part of a long exact sequence, and we prove that the third term in the long exact sequence vanishes in the required range.

The long exact sequence of the pair in the first form of the definition is · · · −→ πq+1 (X; A, B) −→ πq (A, C) −→ πq (X, B) −→ πq (X; A, B) −→ · · · . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. For a triad (X; A, B) with basepoint ∗ ∈ C = A ∩ B, define πq (X; A, B) = πq−1 (P (X; ∗, B), P (A; ∗, C)), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A chain complex over R is a sequence of maps of R-modules · · · −→ Xi+1 di+1 −−−→ Xi d i d i −→ Xi−1 −→ · · · such that di ◦ di+1 = 0 for all i (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

An element of the kernel of di is called a cycle and an element of the image of di+1 is called a boundary. We say that two cycles are “homologous” if their difference is a boundary. We write Bi (X) ⊂ Zi (X) ⊂ Xi (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

for the submodules of boundaries and cycles, respectively, and we define the ith homology group Hi (X) to be the quotient module Zi (X)/Bi (X). We write H∗ (X) for the sequence of Rmodules Hi (X). We understand “graded R-modules” to be sequences of R-modules such as this (and we never take the sum of elements in different gradings). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A chain homotopy s : f ≃ g between chain maps f, g : X −→ X ′ is a sequence ′ of homomorphisms si : Xi −→ Xi+1 such that d′ ′i ′i+1 ◦ si + si−1 ◦ di = fi − gi (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma. A chain homotopy s : f ≃ g between chain maps f, g : X −→ X ′ determines and is determined by a chain map h : X ⊗I −→ X ′ such that h(x, [0]) = f (x) and h(x, [1]) = g(x).

We regard R-modules M as chain complexes concentrated in degree zero, and thus with zero differential. For a chain complex X, there results a chain complex X ⊗ M ; H∗ (X ⊗ M ) is called the homology of X with coefficients in M . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Define a chain complex I by letting I0 be the free Abelian group with two generators [0] and [1], letting I1 be the free Abelian group with one generator [I] such that d([I]) = [0] − [1], and letting Ii = 0 for all other i.

A sequence M ′ f − →M g g → M ′′ of modules is exact if im f = ker g. If M ′ = 0, this − means that g is a monomorphism; if M ′′ = 0, it means that f is an epimorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. A short exact sequence of chain complexes naturally gives rise to a long exact sequence of R-modules · · · −→ Hq (X ′ ) f f∗ −→ Hq (X) g g∗ −→ Hq (X ′′ ) ∂ ∂ − → Hq−1 (X ′ ) −→ · · · .

We define the “connecting homomorphism” ∂ : Hq (X ′′ ) −→ Hq−1 (X ′ ) by ∂[x′′ ] = [x′ ], where f (x′ ) = d(x) for some x such that g(x) = x′′ . There is such an x since g is an epimorphism, and there is such an x′ since gd(x) = dg(x) = 0. It is a standard exercise in “diagram chasing” to verify that ∂ is well defined and the sequence is exact (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let 0 −→ π f − →ρ g − → σ −→ 0 be an exact sequence of Abelian groups and let C be a chain complex of flat (= torsion free) Abelian groups. Write H∗ (C; π) = H∗ (C ⊗ π).

Unlike homotopy groups, these are stable invariants, the same for a space and its suspension, and it is this that makes them computable. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Fix an Abelian group π and consider pairs of spaces (X, A). We shall see that π determines a “homology theory on pairs (X, A).” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Clearly, up to canonical isomorphism, this construction of a homology theory on pairs of spaces is independent of the choice of our CW approximation functor Γ. The reader may have seen singular homology before. As we shall explain later, the classical construction of singular homology amounts to a choice of a particularly nice CW approximation functor, one that is actually functorial on the point-set level, before passage to homotopy categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let X be a CW complex. We shall define the cellular chain complex C∗ (X). We let Cn (X) be the free Abelian group with one generator [j] for each n-cell j. We must define a differential dn : Cn (X) −→ Cn−1 (X) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It will be convenient to work with unreduced cones, cofibers, and suspensions in this section; that is, we do not choose basepoints and so we do not collapse out lines through basepoints (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We still have the basic result that if i : A −→ X is a cofibration, then collapsing the cone on A to a point gives a homotopy equivalence ψ : Ci −→ X/A.

However, there are three models of S n that are needed in our discussion: the standard sphere S n ⊂ Dn+1 , the quotient Dn /S n−1 , and the (unreduced) suspension ΣS n−1 . We must fix suitably compatible homeomorphisms relating these “n-spheres.” We define a homeomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We have dealt so far with the case of integral homology. For more general coefficient groups π, we define C∗ (X, A; π) = C∗ (X, A) ⊗ π (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A nice fact about cellular homology is that the definition leads directly to an algebraic procedure for the calculation of the homology of Cartesian products (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. If X and Y are CW complexes, then X × Y is a CW complex such that C∗ (X × Y ) ∼ = ∼ = C∗ (X) ⊗ C∗ (Y ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We define an isomorphism of graded Abelian groups κ : C∗ (X) ⊗ C∗ (Y ) −→ C∗ (X × Y ) by setting κ([i] ⊗ [j]) = (−1) pq [i × j]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Cellular chains make some computations quite trivial.

if we look back at the CW decompositions of the torus T , the projective plane RP 2 , and the Klein bottle K and if we let j denote the unique 2-cell in each case, then we find the following descriptions of the cellular chains and integral homologies by quick direct inspections (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

While homology groups are far easier to compute than homotopy groups, direct chain level calculation is seldom the method of choice.

Since the basepoint is a retract of X, there results a direct sum decomposition E∗ (X) ∼ = ∼ = E ̃ Ẽ∗ (X) ⊕ E∗ (∗) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=115" target="_blank">J. Peter May 115</a>)</p>
the exactness axiom implies that there is a reduced long exact sequence · · · −→ E ̃ Ẽq (A) −→ E ̃ Ẽq (X) −→ Eq (X, A) ∂ ∂ − → E ̃ Ẽq−1 (A) −→ · · · .

We can obtain the unreduced homology groups as special cases of the reduced ones. For an unbased space X, we define a based space X+ by adjoining a disjoint basepoint to X. By the additivity axiom, we see immediately that E∗ (X) = E ̃ Ẽ∗ (X+ ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=115" target="_blank">J. Peter May 115</a>)</p>
In fact, the unreduced cone on a space Y coincides with the reduced cone on Y+ : the line through the disjoint basepoint is identified to the cone point when constructing the reduced cone on Y+ . Therefore the unreduced cofiber of an unbased map f coincides with the reduced cofiber of the based map f+ . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=116" target="_blank">J. Peter May 116</a>)</p>
The observant reader will have noticed that the unreduced suspension of X is not the reduced suspension on X+ . Rather, under either interpretation of suspension, Σ(X+ ) is homotopy equivalent to the wedge of Σ(X) and a circle. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

a special case of the reduced homology of spaces. Theorem. For any cofibration i : A −→ X, the quotient map q : (X, A) −→ (X/A, ∗) induces an isomorphism E∗ (X, A) −→ E∗ (X/A, ∗) = E ̃ Ẽ∗ (X/A). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=116" target="_blank">J.

Recall that a basepoint ∗ ∈ X is nondegenerate if the inclusion {∗} −→ X is a cofibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=117" target="_blank">J. Peter May 117</a>)</p>
This ensures that the inclusion of the line through the basepoint in the unreduced suspension of X is a cofibration, so that the map from the unreduced suspension to the suspension that collapses out the line through the basepoint is a homotopy equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=117" target="_blank">J.

Theorem. For a nondegenerately based space X, there is a natural isomorphism Σ : E ̃ Ẽq (X) ∼ = ∼ = E ̃ Ẽq+1 (ΣX). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. For any n and q, ̃ Ẽq (S n ) ∼ = ∼ = Eq−n (∗). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=117" target="_blank">J. Peter May 117</a>)</p>
In the study of generalized homology theories, it is most convenient to restrict attention to reduced homology theories defined on nondegenerately based spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=118" target="_blank">J.

Definition. A reduced homology theory ̃ Ẽ∗ consists of functors ̃ Ẽq from the homotopy category of nondegenerately based spaces to the category of Abelian groups that satisfy the following axioms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=118" target="_blank">J. Peter May 118</a>)</p>
For the additivity axiom, we note that the cofiber of a disjoint union of maps is the wedge of the cofibers of the given maps (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=119" target="_blank">J. Peter May 119</a>)</p>
The first is the long exact sequence of a triple (X, A, B) of spaces B ⊂ A ⊂ X, which is just like its analogue for homotopy groups. Proposition. For a triple (X, A, B), the following sequence is exact: · · · −→ Eq (A, B) i i −→∗ Eq (X, B) j j∗ −→ Eq (X, A) ∂ ∂ − → Eq−1 (A, B) −→ · · · . Here i : (A, B) −→ (X, B) and j : (X, B) −→ (X, A) are inclusions and ∂ is the composite Eq (X, A) ∂ ∂ − → Eq−1 (A) −→ Eq−1 (A, B). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Mayer-Vietoris sequence). Let (X; A, B) be an excisive triad and set C = A ∩ B. The following sequence is exact: · · · −→ Eq (C) ψ − → Eq (A) ⊕ Eq (B) φ − → Eq (X) ∆ ∆ −→ Eq−1 (C) −→ · · · . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=120" target="_blank">J. Peter May 120</a>)</p>
Alternatively, one can use CW approximation. For a CW triad, there is a short exact sequence 0 −→ C∗ (C) −→ C∗ (A) ⊕ C∗ (B) −→ C∗ (X) −→ 0 whose associated long exact sequence is the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=121" target="_blank">J.

We have seen that the compactness of spheres S n and cylinders S n × I implies that, for any choice of basepoint in X0 , the natural map colim π∗ (Xi ) −→ π∗ (X) is an isomorphism. We shall use the additivity and weak equivalence axioms and the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to prove the analogue for homology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=122" target="_blank">J. Peter May 122</a>)</p>
We record an algebraic description of the colimit of a sequence for use in the proof. Lemma. Let fi : Ai −→ Ai+1 be a sequence of homomorphisms of Abelian groups. Then there is a short exact sequence s a short 0 −→ i Ai ct seq − → i Ai β − → colim Ai −→ 0, where α(ai ) = ai − fi (ai ) for ai ∈ Ai and the restriction of β to Ai is the canonical map given by the definition of a colimit (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=123" target="_blank">J. Peter May 123</a>)</p>
The proof makes use of a useful general construction called the “telescope” of the Xi , denoted tel Xi (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=123" target="_blank">J. Peter May 123</a>)</p>
Inductively, let Y0 = X0 × {0} and suppose that we have constructed Yi ⊃ Xi × {i}. Define Yi+1 to be the double mapping cylinder Yi ∪ Mi+1 obtained by identifying (x, i) ∈ Yi with (x, i) ∈ Mi+1 for x ∈ Xi . Define tel Xi to be the union of the Yi , with the colimit topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=123" target="_blank">J. Peter May 123</a>)</p>
Remark. There is a general theory of “homotopy colimits,” which are up to homotopy versions of colimits. The telescope is the homotopy colimit of a sequence. The double mapping cylinder that we used in approximating excisive triads by CW triads is the homotopy pushout of a diagram of the shape • ←− • −→ •. We implicitly used homotopy coequalizers in constructing CW approximations of spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. For based spaces X, define the Hurewicz homomorphism h : πn (X) −→ H ̃ H̃n (X) by h([f ]) = f∗ (in ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=125" target="_blank">J. Peter May 125</a>)</p>
The dimension axiom implicitly fixes a generator i0 of ̃ H̃0 (S 0 ), and we choose generators in of ̃ H̃n (S n ) inductively by setting Σin = in+1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma. Let X be a wedge of n-spheres. Then h : πn (X) −→ H ̃ H̃n (X) is the Abelianization homomorphism if n = 1 and is an isomorphism if n > 1. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Hurewicz). Let X be any (n − 1)-connected based space. Then h : πn (X) −→ H ̃ H̃n (X) is the Abelianization homomorphism if n = 1 and is an isomorphism if n > 1.

Here the groups on the left are defined in terms of homotopy groups and were used in our construction of cellular chains, while the groups on the right are those of our given homology theory. We use the groups on the right to construct cellular chains in our given theory, and we find that the isomorphism is compatible with differentials (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Thus let X be a CW complex. For each integer n, define Cn (X) = Hn (X n , X n−1 ) ∼ = ∼ = H ̃ H̃n (X n /X n−1 ). Define d : Cn (X) −→ Cn−1 (X) to be the composite Hn (X n , X n−1 ) ∂ ∂ − → Hn−1 (X n−1 ) −→ Hn−1 (X n−1 , X n−2 ). It is not hard to check that d ◦ d = 0.

Theorem. There is a natural isomorphism H∗ (X, A) ∼ = ∼ = H∗ (C∗ (X, A)) under which the natural transformation ∂ agrees with the natural transformation induced by the connecting homomorphisms associated to the short exact sequences 0 −→ C∗ (A) −→ C∗ (X) −→ C∗ (X, A) −→ 0.

By the dimension and additivity axioms, we know the homology of wedges of spheres (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">J. Peter May 128</a>)</p>
(Hint: construct M (π, n) as the cofiber of a map between wedges of spheres.) The spaces M (π, n) are called Moore spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

(Hint: start with M (π, n), using the Hurewicz theorem, and kill its higher homotopy groups.) The spaces K(π, n) are called Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

There are “face maps” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=131" target="_blank">J. Peter May 131</a>)</p>

A map f : ∆n −→ X is called a singular n-simplex (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=132" target="_blank">J. Peter May 132</a>)</p>
The singular homology of X is usually defined in terms of this chain complex: H∗ (X; π) = H∗ (C∗ (X) ⊗ π). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=132" target="_blank">J. Peter May 132</a>)</p>
We define a space ΓX, called the “geometric realization of the total singular complex of X,” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=132" target="_blank">J. Peter May 132</a>)</p>
We may define the geometric realization |K∗ | of general simplicial sets exactly as we defined the geometric realization ΓX = |S∗ X| of the total singular complex of a topological space. In fact, the total singular complex and geometric realization functors are adjoint (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=134" target="_blank">J. Peter May 134</a>)</p>
One can define a simplicial object in any category C as a sequence of objects Kn of C connected by face and degeneracy maps in C that satisfy the commutation relations that we have displayed. Thus we have simplicial groups, simplicial Abelian groups, simplicial spaces, and so forth. We can think of simplicial sets as discrete simplicial spaces, and we then see that geometric realization generalizes directly to a functor | − | from the category S U of simplicial spaces to the category U of spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">J. Peter May 135</a>)</p>
We note one of the principal features of geometric realization (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">J. Peter May 135</a>)</p>
The projections induce maps of simplicial spaces from X∗ × Y∗ to X∗ and Y∗ . On passage to geometric realization, these give the coordinates of a map |X∗ × Y∗ | −→ |X∗ | × |Y∗ |. It turns out that this map is always a homeomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">J. Peter May 135</a>)</p>
Now restrict attention to simplicial sets K∗ and L∗ . Then the homeomorphism just specified is a map between CW complexes. However, it is not a cellular map; rather, it takes the n-skeleton of |K∗ × L∗ | to the 2n-skeleton of |K∗ | × |L∗ |. It is homotopic to a cellular map, no longer a homeomorphism, and there results a chain homotopy equivalence C∗ (|K∗ × L∗ |) −→ C∗ (|K∗ |) ⊗ C∗ (|L∗ |) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">J. Peter May 135</a>)</p>
In particular, for spaces X and Y , there is a natural chain homotopy equivalence from the singular chain complex C∗ (X × Y ) to the tensor product C∗ (X) ⊗ C∗ (Y ).

The space BG is called the classifying space of G (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=136" target="_blank">J. Peter May 136</a>)</p>
We may view Bn (G) as the orbit space En (G)/G. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=136" target="_blank">J. Peter May 136</a>)</p>
It is less intuitive, but true, that the space E(G) is contractible. By the long exact homotopy sequence, these facts imply that πq+1 (BG) ∼ = ∼ = πq (G) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=136" target="_blank">J. Peter May 136</a>)</p>
We illustrate these ideas by defining the “classifying spaces” and “universal bundles” associated to topological groups G (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This allows us to iterate the construction, setting B 0 (G) = G and B n (G) = B(B n−1 (G)) for n ≥ 1. Specializing to a discrete Abelian group π, we define K(π, n) = B n (π).

Indeed, if one focuses on singular chains, then one eschews chain level computations in principle as well as in practice. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We here recall some classical results in homological algebra that explain how to calculate H∗ (X; π) from H∗ (X) ≡ H∗ (X; Z) and how to calculate H∗ (X × Y ) from H∗ (X) ⊗ H∗ (Y ).

Recall that an R-module M is said to be flat if the functor M ⊗ N is exact (that is, preserves exact sequences in the variable N ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For a principal ideal domain (PID) R, the only torsion product is the first one, denoted Tor R 1 (M, N ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It can be computed by constructing a short exact sequence 0 −→ F1 −→ F0 −→ M −→ 0 and tensoring with N to obtain an exact seqence 0 −→ Tor R 1 (M, N ) −→ F1 ⊗ N −→ F0 ⊗ N −→ M ⊗ N −→ 0, where F1 and F0 are free R-modules. That is, we choose an epimorphism F0 −→ M and note that, since R is a PID, its kernel F1 is also free. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Then, for each n, there is a natural short exact sequence 0 −→ Hn (X) ⊗ M α α − → Hn (X ⊗ M ) β → Tor − R 1 (Hn−1 (X), M ) −→ 0.

. We assume that the reader has seen Ext modules, which measure the failure of Hom to be an exact functor. For a PID R, the only Ext module is the first one, denoted Ext1 R R (M, N ).

Then, for each n, there is a natural short exact sequence 0 −→ Ext1 R R (Hn−1 (X), M ) β − → H n (X; M ) α α − → Hom(Hn (X), M ) −→ 0. The sequence splits, so that H n (X; M ) ∼ = ∼ = Hom(Hn (X), M ) ⊕ Ext1 R R (Hn−1 (X), M ), but the splitting is not natural. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. If R is a field, then α : H ∗ (X; M ) −→ Hom(H∗ (X), M ) is a natural isomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=142" target="_blank">J. Peter May 142</a>)</p>
Second, when R is a PID, a short exact sequence 0 −→ L ′ −→ L −→ L ′′ −→ 0 of R-modules gives rise to a six-term exact sequence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=143" target="_blank">J. Peter May 143</a>)</p>
For Rmodules L, M , and N , we have an adjunction Hom(L ⊗ M, N ) ∼ = ∼ = Hom(L, Hom(M, N )). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=144" target="_blank">J. Peter May 144</a>)</p>
We also have a natural homomorphism Hom(L, M ) ⊗ N −→ Hom(L, M ⊗ N ), and this is an isomorphism if either L or N is a finitely generated projective Rmodule (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=144" target="_blank">J. Peter May 144</a>)</p>
Again, we have a natural map Hom(L, M ) ⊗ Hom(L ′ , M ′ ) −→ Hom(L ⊗ L ′ , M ⊗ M ′ ), which is an isomorphism if L and L′ are finitely generated and projective or if L is finitely generated and projective and M = R.

For its flatness hypothesis, it is useful to remember that, for any Noetherian ring R, the dual Hom(F, R) of a free R-module is a flat R-module (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The essential new feature is the cup product structure that makes the cohomology of X with coefficients in a commutative ring R a commutative graded R-algebra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=145" target="_blank">J. Peter May 145</a>)</p>
For general spaces X, we can use ΓX = |S∗ X| as a canonical CW approximation functor (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=146" target="_blank">J. Peter May 146</a>)</p>
By our observations about cochain complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=147" target="_blank">J. Peter May 147</a>)</p>
This product makes H ∗ (X; R) into a graded unital, associative, and “commutative” R-algebra. Here commutativity is understood in the appropriate graded sense (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=147" target="_blank">J. Peter May 147</a>)</p>
In both diagrams, τ (x ⊗ y) = (−1) pq y ⊗ x if deg x = p and deg y = q. The reason is that, on the topological level, t permutes p-cells past q-cells and, on the level of cellular chains, this involves the transposition S p+q = S p ∧ S q −→ S q ∧ S p = S p+q . We leave it as an exercise that this map has degree (−1)pq . It is this fact that forces the cup product to be commutative in the graded sense (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=148" target="_blank">J. Peter May 148</a>)</p>
In principle, the way to compute cup products is to pass to cellular chains from a cellular approximation to the diagonal map ∆. The point is that ∆ fails to be cellular since it carries the n-skeleton of X to the 2n-skeleton of X × X. In practice, this does not work very well and more indirect means of computation must be used. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=148" target="_blank">J. Peter May 148</a>)</p>
4. An example: RP n and the Borsuk-Ulam theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=148" target="_blank">J. Peter May 148</a>)</p>
We shall later use Poincaré duality to give a quick proof that the cohomology algebra H ∗ (RP n ; Z2 ) is a truncated polynomial algebra Z2 [x]/(xn+1 ), where deg x = 1. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=148" target="_blank">J. Peter May 148</a>)</p>
We use this fact together with covering space theory to prove a celebrated result known as the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. A map g : S m −→ S n is said to be antipodal if it takes pairs of antipodal points to pairs of antipodal points. It then induces a map f : RP m −→ RP n such that the following diagram commutes: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=149" target="_blank">J. Peter May 149</a>)</p>
Theorem. If m > n ≥ 1, then there exist no antipodal maps S m −→ S n . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=149" target="_blank">J. Peter May 149</a>)</p>
Theorem (Borsuk-Ulam). For any continuous map f : S n −→ Rn , there exists x ∈ S n such that f (x) = f (−x). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=149" target="_blank">J. Peter May 149</a>)</p>
Proof. Suppose for a contradiction that f (x) 6= f (−x) for all x. We could then define a continuous antipodal map g : S n −→ S n−1 by letting g(x) be the point at which the vector from 0 through f (x) − f (−x) intersects S n−1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=149" target="_blank">J. Peter May 149</a>)</p>
We give an outline of one of the most striking features of cohomology: the cohomology groups of a space X with coefficients in the homotopy groups of a space Y control the construction of homotopy classes of maps X −→ Y . As a matter of motivation, this helps explain why one is interested in general coefficient groups. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=150" target="_blank">J. Peter May 150</a>)</p>
Definition. Fix n ≥ 1. A connected space X is said to be n-simple if π1 (X) is Abelian and acts trivially on the homotopy groups πq (X) for q ≤ n; X is said to be simple if it is n-simple for all n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=150" target="_blank">J. Peter May 150</a>)</p>
We ask when f can be extended to a map X n+1 −→ Y that restricts to the given map on A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=150" target="_blank">J. Peter May 150</a>)</p>
Let f : X n −→ Y be a map (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=150" target="_blank">J. Peter May 150</a>)</p>
If we compose the attaching maps S n → X of cells of X \ A with f , we obtain elements of πn (Y ). These elements specify a well defined “obstruction cocycle” cf ∈ C n+1 (X, A; πn (Y )). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=150" target="_blank">J. Peter May 150</a>)</p>
Clearly, by considering extensions cell by cell, f extends to X n+1 if and only if cf = 0 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=150" target="_blank">J. Peter May 150</a>)</p>
considering extensions cell by cell, f extends to X n+1 if and only if cf = 0. This is not a computable criterion. However, if we allow ourselves to modify f a little, then we can refine the criterion to a cohomological one that often is computable. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=150" target="_blank">J. Peter May 150</a>)</p>
Theorem. For f : X n −→ Y , the restriction of f to X n−1 extends to a map n+1 X → Y if and only if [cf ] = 0 in H n+1 (X, A; πn (Y )). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Given maps f, f ′ : X n → Y and a homotopy rel A of their restrictions to X n−1 , there is an obstruction class in H n (X, A; πn (Y )) that vanishes if and only if the restriction of the given homotopy to X n−2 extends to a homotopy f ≃ f ′ rel A.

Theorem (Mayer-Vietoris sequence). Let (X; A, B) be an excisive triad and set C = A ∩ B. The following sequence is exact: · · · −→ E q−1 (C) ∆∗ ∆∗ −−→ E q (X) φ∗ −→ E q (A) ⊕ E q (B) ψ∗ −−→ E q (C) −→ · · · . Here, if i : C −→ A, j : C −→ B, k : A −→ X, and ℓ : B −→ X are the inclusions, then φ ∗ (χ) = (k ∗ (χ), ℓ ∗ (χ)) and ψ ∗ (α, β) = i ∗ (α) − j ∗ (β) and ∆∗ is the composite E q−1 (C) δ → δ → E − q (A, C) ∼ = ∼ = E q (X, B) −→ E q (X).

Theorem (Relative Mayer-Vietoris sequence). The following sequence is exact: · · · −→ E q−1 (Y, C) ∆∗ ∆∗ −−→ E q (Y, X) φ∗ −→ E q (Y, A) ⊕ E q (Y, B) ψ∗ −−→ E q (Y, C) −→ · · · . Here, if i : (Y, C) −→ (Y, A), j : (Y, C) −→ (Y, B), k : (Y, A) −→ (Y, X), and ℓ : (Y, B) −→ (Y, X) are the inclusions, then φ ∗ (χ) = (k ∗ (χ), ℓ ∗ (χ)) and ψ ∗ (α, β) = i ∗ (α) − j ∗ (β) and ∆∗ is the composite E q−1 (Y, C) −→ E q−1 (A, C) ∼ = ∼ = E q−1 (X, B) δ δ − → E q (Y, X).

We shall use the additivity and weak equivalence axioms and the MayerVietoris sequence to explain how to compute E ∗ (X). The answer is more subtle than in homology because, algebraically, limits are less well behaved than colimits: they are not exact functors from diagrams of Abelian groups to Abelian groups. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=156" target="_blank">J.

That is, we may as well define lim 1 Ai to be the displayed cokernel. We then have the following result. Theorem. For each q, there is a natural short exact sequence 0 −→ lim 1 E q−1 (Xi ) −→ E q (X) π π − → lim E q (Xi ) −→ 0, where π is induced by the inclusions Xi −→ X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=156" target="_blank">J.

Rather than go into the general theory, we simply display how the “first right derived functor” lim 1 of an inverse sequence of Abelian groups can be computed (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=156" target="_blank">J. Peter May 156</a>)</p>
We say that an inverse sequence fi : Ai+1 −→ Ai satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition if, for each fixed i, there exists j ≥ i such that, for every k > j, the image of the composite Ak −→ Ai is equal to the image of the composite Aj −→ Ai . For example, this holds if all but finitely many of the fi are epimorphisms or if the Ai are all finite. As a matter of algebra, we have the following vanishing result. Lemma. If the inverse sequence fi : Ai+1 −→ Ai satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition, then lim 1 Ai = 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=157" target="_blank">J. Peter May 157</a>)</p>
If we assume given a theory that satisfies the axioms, we see that the cochains with coefficients in π of a CW complex X can be redefined by C n (X; π) = H n (X n , X n−1 ; π), with differential d : C n (X; π) −→ C n+1 (X; π) the composite H n (X n , X n−1 ; π) −→ H n (X n ) δ δ − → H n+1 (X n+1 , X n ). That is, the following result holds. Theorem. C ∗ (X; π) as just defined is isomorphic to Hom(C∗ (X), π). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Cup products are “unstable,” in the sense that they vanish on suspensions. This is an indication of how much more information they carry than the mere additive groups. The proof given by this sequence of exercises actually applies to any “multiplicative” cohomology theory, that is, any theory that has suitable cup products (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Commentary: Additively, cohomology groups are “stable,” in the sense that ̃ H̃ p (Y ) ∼ = ∼ = H ̃ H̃ p+1 (ΣY ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It is apparent that there is a kind of duality relating the construction of homology and cohomology. In its simplest form, this is reflected by the fact that evaluation of cochains on chains gives a natural homomorphism C p (X; π) ⊗ Cp (X; ρ) −→ π ⊗ ρ. This passes to homology and cohomology to give an evaluation pairing H p (X; π) ⊗ Hp (X; ρ) −→ π ⊗ ρ. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

When R is a field and the Hp (X; R) are finite dimensional vector spaces, the adjoint of this pairing is an isomorphism H p (X; R) ∼ = ∼ = HomR (Hp (X; R), R).

That is, the cohomology groups of X are the vector space duals of the homology groups of X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We shall study manifolds without boundary in this chapter, turning to manifolds with boundary in the next. We do not assume that M is differentiable. It is known that M can be given the structure of a finite CW complex, and its homology and cohomology groups are therefore finitely generated. When M is differentiable, it is not hard to prove this using Morse theory, but it is a deep theorem in the general topological case (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If R is a field and M is “R-orientable,” then there is an “R-fundamental class” z ∈ Hn (M ; R). The composite of the cup product and evaluation on z gives a cup product pairing H p (M ; R) ⊗ H n−p (M ; R) −→ R. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

One version of the Poincaré duality theorem asserts that this pairing is nonsingular, so that its adjoint is an isomorphism H p (M ; R) = ∼ = HomR (H ∼ n−p (M ; R), R) ∼ = ∼ = Hn−p (M ; R).

Theorem (Poincaré duality). Let M be a compact R-oriented n-manifold. Then, for an R-module π, there is an isomorphism D : H p (M ; π) −→ Hn−p (M ; π).

Proposition. If M is a compact n-manifold, then an R-orientation of M determines and is determined by an R-fundamental class z ∈ Hn (M ; R). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. Let Tp ⊂ H p (M ) be the torsion subgroup. The cup product pairing α ⊗ β −→ hαβ, zi induces a nonsingular pairing H p (M )/Tp ⊗ H n−p (M )/Tn−p −→ Z.

Corollary. As a graded ring, H ∗ (CP n ) is the truncated polynomial algebra Z[α]/(αn+1 ), where deg α = 2. That is, H 2q (CP n ) is the free Abelian group with generator αq for 1 ≤ q ≤ n.

We shall see that an oriented manifold is R-oriented for any commutative ring R (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=161" target="_blank">J. Peter May 161</a>)</p>
a field. Then α ⊗ β −→ hα ∪ β, zi defines a nonsingular pairing H p (M ; R) ⊗R H n−p (M ; R) −→ R. We shall see that every manifold is Z2 -oriented, and an argument exactly like that for CP n allows us to compute the cup products in H ∗ (RP n ; Z2 ).

Corollary. As a graded ring, H ∗ (RP n ; Z2 ) is the truncated polynomial algebra Z2 [α]/(α n+1 ), where deg α = 1. That is, α q is the non-zero element of H q (RP n ; Z2 ) for 1 ≤ q ≤ n.

Using the evident natural map from the tensor product of homologies to the homology of a tensor product, we see that ∩ passes to homology to induce a pairing ∩ : H ∗ (X; π) ⊗R H∗ (X; R) −→ H∗ (X; π).

We think of Hn (M, M − x) as a free R-module on one generator, but the generator (which corresponds to a unit of the ring R) is unspecified. Intuitively, an R-orientation of M is a consistent choice of generators. Definition. An R-fundamental class of M at a subspace X is an element z ∈ Hn (M, M − X) such that, for each x ∈ X, the image of z under the map Hn (M, M − X) −→ Hn (M, M − x) induced by the inclusion (M, M − X) −→ (M, M − x) is a generator. If X = M , we refer to z ∈ Hn (M ) as a fundamental class of M . An R-orientation of M is an open cover {Ui } and R-fundamental classes zi of M at Ui such that if Ui ∩ Uj is non-empty, then zi and zj map to the same element of Hn (M, M − Ui ∩ Uj ).

We say that M is R-orientable if it admits an R-orientation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=164" target="_blank">J. Peter May 164</a>)</p>
Theorem (Vanishing). Let M be an n-manifold. For any coefficient group π, Hi (M ; π) = 0 if i > n, and ̃ H̃n (M ; π) = 0 if M is connected and is not compact.

We can use this together with Mayer-Vietoris sequences to construct R-fundamental classes at compact subspaces from R-orientations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Let K be a compact subset of M . Then, for any coefficient group π, Hi (M, M − K; π) = 0 if i > n, and an R-orientation of M determines an Rfundamental class of M at K. In particular, if M is compact, then an R-orientation of M determines an R-fundamental class of M (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. Let M be a connected compact n-manifold, n > 0. Then either M is not orientable and Hn (M ; Z) = 0 or M is orientable and the map Hn (M ; Z) −→ Hn (M, M − x; Z) ∼ = ∼ =Z is an isomorphism for every x ∈ M .

As an aside, the corollary leads to a striking example of the failure of the naturality of the splitting in the universal coefficient theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Thus the left and right vertical arrows are zero. If the splittings of the rows were natural, this would imply that the middle vertical arrow is also zero (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We begin with the general observation that homology is “compactly supported” in the sense of the following result. Lemma. For any space X and element x ∈ Hq (X), there is a compact subspace K of X and an element k ∈ Hq (K) that maps to x. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

the much more subtle statement that Hn (M ) = 0 if M is connected and is not compact. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=166" target="_blank">J. Peter May 166</a>)</p>
Remember that homology is a covariant functor with compact supports. Cohomology is a contravariant functor, and it does not have compact supports (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We would like to prove the Poincaré duality theorem by inductive comparisons of Mayer-Vietoris sequences, and the opposite variance of homology and cohomology makes it unclear how to proceed. To get around this, we introduce a variant of cohomology that does have compact supports and has enough covariant functoriality to allow us to proceed by comparisons of Mayer-Vietoris sequences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Consider the set K of compact subspaces K of M . This set is directed under inclusion; to conform with our earlier discussion of colimits, we may view K as a category whose objects are the compact subspaces K and whose maps are the inclusions between them. We define H q cq (M ) = colim H q (M, M − K), where the colimit is taken with respect to the homomorphisms H q (M, M − K) −→ H q (M, M − L) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Intuitively, thinking in terms of singular cohomology, its elements are represented by cocycles that vanish off some compact subspace (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A map f : M −→ N is said to be proper if f −1 (L) is compact in M when L is compact in N . This holds, for example, if f is the inclusion of a closed subspace (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Poincaré duality). Let M be an R-oriented n-manifold. Then D : Hcp cp (M ) −→ Hn−p (M ) is an isomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

6. The orientation cover There is an orientation cover of a manifold that helps illuminate the notion of orientability (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. Let M be a connected n-manifold. Then there is a 2-fold cover p : ̃ M̃ −→ M such that ̃ M̃ is connected if and only if M is not orientable (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary. If M is simply connected, or if π1 (M ) contains no subgroup of index 2, then M is orientable. If M is orientable, then M admits exactly two orientations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=172" target="_blank">J. Peter May 172</a>)</p>
We can use homology with coefficients in a commutative ring R to construct an analogous R-orientation cover. It depends on the units of R. For example, if R = Z2 , then the R-orientation cover is the identity map of M since there is a unique unit in R. This reproves the obvious fact that any manifold is Z2 oriented. The evident ring homomorphism Z −→ R induces a natural homomorphism H∗ (X; Z) −→ H∗ (X; R), and we see immediately that an orientation of M induces an R-orientation of M for any R.

The Poincaré duality theorem imposes strong constraints on the Euler characteristic of a manifold. It also leads to new invariants, most notably the index. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=173" target="_blank">J.

Moreover, there is a relative version of Poincaré duality in the context of manifolds with boundary, and this leads to necessary algebraic conditions on the cohomology of a manifold that must be satisfied if it is to be a boundary. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=173" target="_blank">J.

We shall later outline the theory of cobordism, which leads to necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for a manifold to be a boundary. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The Euler characteristic χ(X) of a space with finitely generated homology is defined by istic χ(X) χ(X) = i (−1)i rank Hi (X; Z).

We may take F = Z2 , and so dispense with the requirement that M be oriented. If n is odd, the summands of χ(M ) cancel in pairs, and we obtain the following conclusion. Proposition. If M is a compact manifold of odd dimension, then χ(M ) = 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This pairing is nonsingular. Since α ∪ β = (−1)m β ∪ α, it is skew symmetric if m is odd and is symmetric if m is even. When m is odd, we obtain the following conclusion. Proposition. If M is a compact oriented n-manifold, where n ≡ 2 mod 4, then χ(M ) is even. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma. Let F be a field of characteristic 6= 2, V be a finite dimensional vector space over F , and φ : V × V −→ F be a nonsingular skew symmetric bilinear form. Then V has a basis {x1 , . . ., xr , y1 , . . ., yr } such that φ(xi , yi ) = 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ r and φ(z, w) = 0 for all other pairs of basis elements (z, w). Therefore the dimension of V is even (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

Lemma. Let V be a finite dimensional real vector space and φ : V × V −→ R be a nonsingular symmetric bilinear form. Define q(x) = φ(x, x). Then V has a basis {x1 , . . ., xr , y1 , . . ., ys } such that φ(z, w) = 0 for all pairs (z, w) of distinct basis elements, q(xi ) = 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ r and q(yj ) = −1 for 1 ≤ j ≤ s. The number r − s is an invariant of φ, called the signature of (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. Let M be a compact oriented n-manifold. If n = 4k, define the index of M , denoted I(M ), to be the signature of the cup product form H 2k (M ; R)⊗ H 2k (M ; R) −→ R. If n 6≡ 0 mod 4, define I(M ) = 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

Proposition. For any compact oriented n-manifold, χ(M ) ≡ I(M ) mod 2. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=174" target="_blank">J. Peter May 174</a>)</p>
The Euler characteristic and index are related by the following congruence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=174" target="_blank">J. Peter May 174</a>)</p>
Lemma. If M and M ′ are compact oriented n-manifolds, then I(M ∐ M ′ ) = I(M ) + I(M ′ ), where M ∐ M ′ is given the evident orientation induced from those of M and M ′ .

Lemma. Let M be a compact oriented m-manifold and N be a compact oriented n-manifold. Then I(M × N ) = I(M ) · I(N ), where M × N is given the orientation induced from those of M and N .

Let Hn = {(x1 , . . ., xn )|xn ≥ 0} be the upper half-plane in Rn . Recall that an n-manifold with boundary is a Hausdorff space M having a countable basis of open sets such that every point of M has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of H n . A point x is an interior point if it has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of Hn − ∂Hn ∼ = Rn ; otherwise it is a boundary point. It is a fact called “invariance of domain” that if U and V are homeomorphic subspaces of Rn and U is open, then V is open. Therefore, a homeomorphism of an open subspace of Hn onto an open subspace of Hn carries boundary points to boundary points. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We denote the boundary of an n-manifold M by ∂M . Thus M is a manifold without boundary if ∂M is empty; M is said to be closed if, in addition, it is compact. The space ∂M is an (n − 1)-manifold without boundary. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It is a fundamental question in topology to determine which closed manifolds are boundaries (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

we can ask whether or not a smooth (= differentiable) closed manifold is the boundary of a smooth manifold (with the induced smooth structure) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Remember that χ(M ) = 0 if M is a closed manifold of odd dimension. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=176" target="_blank">J. Peter May 176</a>)</p>
Proposition. If M = ∂W , where W is a compact (2m + 1)-manifold, then χ(M ) = 2χ(W ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=176" target="_blank">J. Peter May 176</a>)</p>

For example, since χ(RP 2m ) = 1 and χ(CP n ) = n+ 1, this criterion shows that 2m RP and CP 2m cannot be boundaries. Notice that we have proved that these are not boundaries of topological manifolds, let alone of smooth ones. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The index gives a more striking criterion: if a closed oriented 4k-manifold M is the boundary of a (topological) manifold, then I(M ) = 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In the case of smooth manifolds, it can be seen in terms of inward-pointing unit vectors of the normal line bundle of the embedding ∂M −→ M . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We let M be an n-manifold with boundary, n > 0, throughout this section, and we let R be a given commutative ring. We say that M is R-orientable (or orientable if R = Z) if its interior ̊ M̊ = M − ∂M is R-orientable; similarly, an R-orientation of M is an R-orientation of its interior (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Topological collaring). There is an open neighborhood V of ∂M in M such that the identification ∂M = ∂M × {0} extends to a homeomorphism V ∼ = ∼ = ∂M × [0, 1).

Proposition. If M is compact and R-oriented and z∂M ∈ Hn−1 (∂M ) is the fundamental class determined by the induced R-orientation on ∂M , then there is a unique element z ∈ Hn (M, ∂M ) such that ∂z = z∂M ; z is called the R-fundamental class determined by the R-orientation of M .

We first give an algebraic criterion for the vanishing of the signature of a form and then show that the cup product form on the middle dimensional cohomology of M satisfies the criterion. Lemma. Let W be a n-dimensional subspace of a 2n-dimensional real vector space V . Let φ : V × V −→ R be a nonsingular symmetric bilinear form such that φ : W × W −→ R is identically zero. Then the signature of φ is zero. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

We here give a homotopical way of constructing ordinary theories that makes no use of chains, whether cellular or singular. We also show how to construct cup and cap products homotopically. This representation of homology and cohomology in terms of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces is the starting point of the modern approach to homology and cohomology theory, and we shall indicate how theories that do not satisfy the dimension axiom can be represented (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

indicate how theories that do not satisfy the dimension axiom can be represented. We shall also describe Postnikov systems, which give a way to approximate general (simple) spaces by weakly equivalent spaces built up out of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces.

The example at hand is the Eilenberg-Mac Lane prespectrum {K(π, n)}. Another example is the “suspension prespectrum” {Σn X} of a based space X; the required maps Σ(Σn X) −→ Σn+1 X are the evident identifications. When X = S 0 , this is called the sphere prespectrum.

If Z has a multiplication φ : Z × Z −→ Z such that the basepoint ∗ of Z is a two-sided unit up to homotopy, so that Z is an “H-space,” then φ induces an “addition” [X, Z] × [X, Z] −→ [X, Z].

. We say that Z is “grouplike” if there is a map χ : Z −→ Z such that φ(id × χ)∆ : Z −→ Z is homotopic to the trivial map, and then χ∗ : [X, Z] −→ [X, Z] sends an element x ∈ [X, Z] to x−1 .

Actually, the existence of inverses can be deduced if Z is only “grouplike” in the weaker sense that π0 (X) is a group, but we shall not need the extra generality. Now consider the multiplication on a loop space ΩY given by composition of loops. Our proof that π1 (Y ) is a group and π2 (Y ) is an Abelian group amounts to a proof of the following result. Lemma. For any based space Y , ΩY is a grouplike homotopy associative Hspace and Ω 2 Y is a grouplike homotopy associative and commutative H-space. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It is a consequence of a general result called the Brown representability theorem that every reduced cohomology theory is represented in this fashion by an Ω-prespectrum.

We can also construct cap products homotopically. To do so, it is convenient to bring function spaces into play, using the obvious isomorphisms [X, Y ] ∼ = ∼ = π0 F (X, Y ) and evaluation maps ε : F (X, Y ) ∧ X −→ Y.

We have implicitly studied the represented functors k(X) = [X, Y ] by decomposing X into cells. This led in particular to the calculation of ordinary represented cohomology [X, K(π, n)] by means of cellular chains (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

There is an Eckmann-Hilton dual way of studying [X, Y ] by decomposing Y into “cocells.” We briefly describe this decomposition of spaces into their “Postnikov systems” here (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This decomposition answers a natural question: how close are the homotopy groups of a CW This deco groups of a C Q type? Since n complex X to being a complete set of invariants for its homotopy K(πn (X), n) has the same homotopy groups as X but is generally not weakly homotopy equivalent to it, some added information is needed. If X is simple, it turns out that the homotopy groups together with an inductively defined sequence of cohomology classes give a complete set of invariants.

Recall that a connected space X is said to be simple if π1 (X) is Abelian and acts trivially on πn (X) for n ≥ 2. A Postnikov system for a simple based space X consists of based spaces Xn together with based maps αn : X −→ Xn and pn+1 : Xn+1 −→ Xn , (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The maps αn induce a weak equivalence X → lim Xn , but the inverse limit generally will not have the homotopy type of a CW complex.

By our definition of a Postnikov system, we must define Xn+1 to be the homotopy fiber of k n+2 . Thus its points are pairs (ω, x) consisting of a path ω : I → K(πn+1 (X), n+2) and a point x ∈ Xn such that ω(0) = ∗ and ω(1) = k n+2 (x). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Cohomology operations ̃ H̃ q (−; π) −→ H ̃ H̃ q+n (−; ρ) are in canonical bijective correspondence with elements of ̃ H̃ q+n (K(π, q); ρ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In general, cohomology operations are only natural transformations of setvalued functors. However, stable operations are necessarily homomorphisms of cohomology groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

. To determine all cohomology operations, we need only compute the cohomology of all EilenbergMac Lane spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We have described an explicit construction of these spaces as topological Abelian groups in Chapter 16 §5, and this construction leads to an inductive method of computation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. For n ≥ 0, there are stable cohomology operations Sq n : H q (X; Z2 ) −→ H q+n (X; Z2 ), called the Steenrod operations. They satisfy the following properties (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

There are also formulas, called the Adem relations, describing Sq i Sq j , as a linear combination of operations Sq i+j−k Sq k , 2k (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It turns out that the Steenrod operations generate all mod 2 cohomology operations. In fact, the identity map of K(Z2 , q) specifies a fundamental class ιq ∈ H q (K(Z2 , q); Z2 ), and the following theorem holds. Theorem. H ∗ (K(Z2 , q); Z2 ) is a polynomial algebra whose generators are certain iterates of Steenrod operations applied to the fundamental class ιq . Explicitly, writing Sq I = Sq i1 · · · Sq ij for a sequence of positive integers I = {i1 , . . ., ij }, the generators are the Sq I ιq for those sequences I such that ir ≥ 2ir+1 for 1 ≤ r < j and i1 < i2 + · · · + ij + q.

The β are called Bockstein operations. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=193" target="_blank">J. Peter May 193</a>)</p>
For Abelian groups π and ρ, show that [K(π, n), K(ρ, n)] ∼ = ∼ = Hom(π, ρ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=193" target="_blank">J. Peter May 193</a>)</p>

A map (g, f ) of vector bundles is an isomorphism if and only if f is a homeomorphism and g restricts to an isomorphism on each fiber. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We say that two vector bundles over B are equivalent if they are isomorphic over B, so that there is an isomorphism (g, id) between them. We let En (B) denote the set of equivalence classes of n-plane bundles over B (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Thus we have a contravariant set-valued functor En (−) on spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=195" target="_blank">J. Peter May 195</a>)</p>
Vector bundles should be thought of as rather rigid geometric objects, and the equivalence relation between them preserves that rigidity. Nevertheless, equivalence classes of n-plane bundles can be classified homotopically. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In turn, the starting point of the classification theorem is the observation that the functor En (−), like homology and cohomology, is homotopy invariant in the sense that it factors (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

through the homotopy category hU . In less fancy language, this amounts to the following result. Proposition. The pullbacks of an n-plane bundle p : E −→ B along homotopic maps f0 , f1 : A −→ B are equivalent. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It can be verified on general abstract nonsense grounds, using Brown’s representability theorem, that the functor En (−) is representable in the form [−, BO(n)] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It is far more useful to have an explicit concrete construction of the relevant “classifying space” BO(n). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We construct a particular n-plane bundle γn : En −→ BO(n), called the “universal n-plane bundle.” By pulling back γn along (homotopy classes of) maps f : B −→ BO(n), we obtain a natural transformation of functors [−, BO(n)] −→ En (−). We show that this natural transformation is a natural isomorphism of functors by showing how to construct a map (g, f ), unique up to homotopy, from any given n-plane bundle E over any space B to the universal n-plane bundle En ; it is in this sense that En is “universal.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let Vn (R q ) be the Stiefel variety of orthonormal n-frames in R q . Its points are n-tuples of orthonormal vectors in Rq , and it is topologized as a subspace of (Rq )n or, equivalently, as a subspace of (S q−1 )n . It is a compact manifold. Let Gn (Rq ) be the Grassmann variety of n-planes in Rq . Its points are the n-dimensional subspaces of Rq . Sending an n-tuple of orthonormal vectors to the n-plane they span gives a surjective function Vn (Rq ) −→ Gn (Rq ), and we topologize Gn (Rq ) as a quotient space of Vn (Rq ).

Similarly, using the orthogonal complements of tangent planes, we obtain the Gauss map E(ν) −→ E q q−n of the q normal bundle ν of the embedding of M in R .

Definition. Let k ∗ be a cohomology theory, such as H ∗ (−; π) for an Abelian group π.

Thus, if (g, f ) is a map from a bundle ζ over A to a bundle ξ over B, so that ζ is equivalent to f ∗ ξ, then f ∗ c(ξ) = c(ζ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Since the normal bundle of the standard embedding S q −→ Rq+1 is trivial, w(S q ) = 1. A manifold is said to be parallelizable if its tangent bundle is trivial. For some manifolds M , we can show that M is not parallelizable by showing that one of its Stiefel-Whitney classes is non-zero, but this strategy fails for M = S q .

For example, w(RP q ) = 1 if and only if q = 2k − 1 for some k (as the reader should check) and therefore RP q can be parallelizable only if q is of this form (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If R q+1 admits a bilinear product without zero divisors, then it is not hard to prove that τ (RP q ) ∼ = ∼ = Hom(ζq , ζ ⊥ q⊥ ) admits q linearly independent cross-sections and is therefore trivial. We conclude that Rq+1 can admit such a product only if q+1 = 2k for some k. The real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, and Cayley numbers show that there is such a product for q + 1 = 1, 2, 4, and 8. As we shall explain in the next chapter, these are in fact the only q for which Rq+1 admits such a product (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

While the calculation of w(RP q ) just given is quite special, there is a remarkable general recipe, called the “Wu formula,” for the computation of w(M ) in terms of Poincaré duality and the Steenrod operations in H ∗ (M ; Z2 ). In analogy with w(M ), general recipe, called the “Wu formula,” for the computation of w( Poincaré duality and the Steenrod operations in H ∗ (M ; Z2 ). In anal we define the total Steenrod square of an element x by Sq(x) = i Sq i (x). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Wu formula). Let M be a smooth closed n-manifold with funda(M ; Z2 ). Then the total Stiefel-Whitney class w(M ) is equal Theorem (Wu formula). Let M be a smooth closed n-manifold with funda mental class z ∈ HnP (M ; Z2 ). Then the total Stiefel-Whitney class w(M ) is equ to Sq(v), where v = vi ∈ H ∗∗ (M ; Z2 ) is the unique cohomology class such that hv ∪ x, zi = hSq(x), zi for all x ∈ H (M ; Z2 ). Thus, for k ≥ 0, vk ∪ x = Sq k (x) for all x ∈ H n−k (M ; Z2 ), ∗ and wk (M ) = vk i+j=k Sq i (vj ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=201" target="_blank">J. Peter May 201</a>)</p>
The basic reason that such a formula holds is that the StiefelWhitney classes can be defined in terms of the Steenrod operations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=201" target="_blank">J. Peter May 201</a>)</p>
Since the tangent bundle of M depends on its smooth structure, this is rather surprising (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Characteristic classes determine important numerical invariants of manifolds, called their characteristic numbers. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. Let M be a smooth closed R-oriented n-manifold with fundamental class z ∈ Hn (M ; R). For a characteristic class c of degree n, define the tangential characteristic number c[M ] ∈ R by c[M ] = hc(τ (M )), zi. Similarly, define the normal characteristic number c[ν(M )] by c[ν(M )] = hc(ν(M )), zi, where ν(M ) is the normal bundle associated to an embedding of M in Rq for q sufficiently large. (These numbers are well defined because any two embeddings of M in Rq for large q are isotopic and have equivalent normal bundles.) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

arge q are isotopic and have equivalent normal bundles.) In particular, if ri are integers such that iri = n, then the monomial w r1 · · · wnrn nrn P is a characteristic class of degree n, and all mod 2 characteristic classes of degree n are linear combinations of these. Different manifolds can have the same Stiefel-Whitney numbers (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma. If M is the boundary of a smooth compact (n + 1)-manifold W , then all tangential Stiefel-Whitney numbers of M are zero. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=201" target="_blank">J. Peter May 201</a>)</p>
Lemma. All tangential Stiefel-Whitney numbers of a smooth closed manifold M are zero if and only if all normal Stiefel-Whitney numbers of M are zero. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Thom). If M is a smooth closed n-manifold all of whose normal Stiefel-Whitney numbers are zero, then M is the boundary of a smooth (n + 1)manifold. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)</p>
Thus we need only compute the Stiefel-Whitney numbers of M to determine whether or not it is a boundary. By Wu’s formula, the computation only requires knowledge of the mod 2 cohomology of M , with its Steenrod operations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)</p>
There are several ways to construct the Stiefel-Whitney classes. The most illuminating one depends on a simple, but fundamentally important, construction on vector bundles, namely their “Thom spaces.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)</p>
Definition. Let ξ : E −→ B be an n-plane bundle. Apply one-point compactification to each fiber of ξ to obtain a new bundle Sph(E) over B whose fibers are spheres S n with given basepoints, namely the points at ∞. These basepoints specify a cross-section B −→ Sph(E). Define the Thom space T ξ to be the quotient space T (ξ) = Sph(E)/B. That is, T (ξ) is obtained from E by applying fiberwise one-point compactification and then identifying all of the points at ∞ to a single basepoint (denoted ∞). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)</p>
Remark. If we give the bundle ξ a Euclidean metric and let D(E) and S(E) denote its unit disk bundle and unit sphere bundle, then there is an evident homeomorphism between T ξ and the quotient space D(E)/S(E) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)</p>
In turn, D(E)/S(E) is homotopy equivalent to the cofiber of the inclusion S(E) −→ D(E) and therefore to the cofiber of the projection S(E) −→ B. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=202" target="_blank">J. Peter May 202</a>)</p>
If the bundle ξ is trivial, so that E = B × Rn , then Sph(E) = B × S n . Quotienting out B amounts to the same thing as giving B a disjoint basepoint and then forming the smash product B+ ∧ S n . That is, in this case the Thom complex is Σn B+ . Therefore, for any cohomology theory k ∗ , k q (B) = k̃ k̃ q (B+ ) ∼ = ∼ = k̃ k̃ n+q (T ξ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

which is called the “Thom diagonal. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=203" target="_blank">J. Peter May 203</a>)</p>
This should look very similar to the problem of patching local fundamental classes to obtain a global one; that is, it looks like a question of orientation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. Let ξ : E −→ B be an n-plane bundle. An R-orientation, or Thom class, of ξ is an element µ ∈ ̃ H̃ n (T ξ; R) such that, for every point b ∈ B, i∗b b (µ) is a generator of the free R-module ̃ H̃ n (Sbn bn ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=203" target="_blank">J.

We leave it as an instructive exercise to verify that an R-orientation of a closed n-manifold M determines and is determined by an R-orientation of its tangent bundle τ (M ).

Theorem (Thom isomorphism theorem). Let µ ∈ H ̃ H̃ n (T ξ; R) be a Thom class for an n-plane bundle ξ : E −→ B. Define Φ : H q (B; R) −→ H ̃ H̃ n+q (T ξ; R) by Φ(x) = x ∪ µ. Then Φ is an isomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=203" target="_blank">J.

However, much the best proof from the point of view of anyone seriously interested in algebraic topology is to apply the Serre spectral sequence of the bundle Sph(E). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=203" target="_blank">J.

. Use of a field ensures that the cohomology of the relevant direct limits is the inverse limit of the cohomologies (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=203" target="_blank">J. Peter May 203</a>)</p>
The Serre spectral sequence is a device for computing the cohomology of the total space E of a fibration from the cohomologies of its base B and fiber F . It measures the cohomological deviation of H ∗ (E) from H ∗ (B)⊗H ∗ (F ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Just as in orientation theory for manifolds, the question of orientability depends on the structure of the units of the ring R, and this leads to the following conclusion. Proposition. Every vector bundle admits a unique Z2 -orientation. This can be proved along with the Thom isomorphism theorem by a MayerVietoris argument (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

First, taking the characteristic class point of view, we define the Stiefel-Whitney classes in terms of the Steenrod operations by setting wi (ξ) = Φ −1 Sq i Φ(1) = Φ −1 Sq i (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Here S(γ1 ) is the infinite sphere S ∞ , which is the universal cover of RP ∞ and is therefore contractible (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We indicate two constructions of the Stiefel-Whitney classes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=204" target="_blank">J. Peter May 204</a>)</p>
As we shall explain in §8, passage from topological groups to their classifying spaces is a product-preserving functor, at least up to homotopy. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Indeed, up to homotopy, inner conjugation by an element of G induces the identity map on BG for any topological group G. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

. The subring H ∗ ((RP ∞ )n ; Z2 )Σn of elements invariant under the action is the polynomial algebra on the elementary symmetric functions σi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, in the variables αi .

By the Künneth theorem, we see that H ∗ ((RP ∞ ) n ; Z2 ) = ⊗ i i=1 H ∗ (RP ∞ ; Z2 ) = Z2 [α1 , . . ., αn ], (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The resulting map ω ∗ : H ∗ (BO(n); Z2 ) −→ H ∗ ((RP ∞ ) n ; Z2 ) Σn is a ring homomorphism between polynomial algebras on generators of the same degrees. It turns out to be a monomorphism and therefore an isomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

One advantage of this approach is that, since we know the Steenrod operations on H ∗ (RP ∞ ; Z2 ) and can read them off on H ∗ ((RP ∞ ) n ; Z2 ) by the Cartan formula, it leads to a purely algebraic calculation of the Steenrod operations in H ∗ (BO(n); Z2 ). Explicitly, the following “Wu formula” holds: Sq i (wj ) = fol i t=0 lowing “Wu for j+t−i−1 t u wi−t wj+t . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The proof of the classification theorem for complex n-plane bundles works in exactly the same way as for real n-plane bundles, using complex Grassmann varieties.

In fact, the fundamental groups of the real Grassmann varieties are Z2 , and their universal covers are their orientation covers. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The Thom space of a complex or oriented real vector bundle is the Thom space of its underlying real vector bundle. We obtain characteristic classes in cohomology with any coefficients by applying cohomology operations to Thom classes, but it is rarely the case that the resulting characteristic classes generate all characteristic classes: the cases H ∗ (BO(n); Z2 ) and H ∗ (BSO(n); Z2 ) are exceptional (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The reader deserves to be warned about a basic inconsistency in the literature. Remark. With the discussion above, c1 (γ n+1 1n ) is the canonical generator of H (CP n ; Z), where γ1n+1 2 1n is the canonical line bundle of lines in Cn+1 and points on the line. This is the standard convention in algebraic topology. In algebraic geometry, it is more usual to define Chern classes so that the first Chern class of the dual of γ n+1 1n is the canonical generator of H 2 (CP n ; Z). With this convention, the nth Chern class would be (−1)n cn . It is often unclear in the literature which convention is being followed. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Turning to oriented real vector bundles, we define the Pontryagin and Euler classes as follows, taking cohomology with coefficients in any commutative ring R. Definition.

The name “Euler class” is justified by the following classical result, which well illustrates the kind of information that characteristic numbers can encode. 1 Theorem.

The presence of 2-torsion makes the description of the integral cohomology rings of BO(n) and BSO(n) quite complicated, and these rings are almost never used in applications. Rather, one uses the mod 2 cohomology rings and the following description of the cohomology rings that result by elimination of 2-torsion. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Consider bundles ξ : Y −→ B with fiber G. For spaces U in a numerable open cover O of B, there are homeomorphisms φ : U ×G −→ p−1 (U ) such that p◦φ = π1 . We say that Y is a principal G-bundle if Y has a free right action by G, B is the orbit space Y /G, ξ is the quotient map, and the φ are maps of right G-spaces. We say that ξ : Y −→ B is a universal principal G-bundle if Y is a contractible space. In particular, for any topological group G whose identity element is a nondegenerate basepoint, such as any Lie group G, the map p : EG −→ BG constructed in Chapter 16 §5 is a universal principal G-bundle (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

There is a classification theorem for principal G-bundles. Let PG(B) denote the set of equivalence classes of principal G-bundles over B, where two principal G-bundles over B are equivalent if there is a G-homeomorphism over B between them.

The natural transformation Φ : [−, Y /G] −→ PG(−) obtained by sending the homotopy class of a map f : B −→ Y /G to the equivalence class of the principal G-bundle f ∗ Y is a natural isomorphism of functors.

We conclude that, for any F , PG(B) is naturally isomorphic to the set of equivalence classes of bundles with group G and fiber F over B. Fiber bundles with group O(n) and fiber Rn are real n-plane bundles, fiber bundles with group U (n) and fiber C n are complex n-plane bundles, and fiber bundles with group SO(n) and fiber Rn are oriented real n-plane bundles. Thus the classification theorems of the previous sections could all be rederived as special cases of the general classification theorem for principal G-bundles stated in this section (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

From the point of view of algebraic topology, real K-theory is a substantially more powerful invariant, but complex K-theory is usually more relevant to applications in other fields.

We consider the set V ect(X) of equivalence classes of vector bundles over a space X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=211" target="_blank">J. Peter May 211</a>)</p>
. The set V ect(X) forms an Abelian monoid (= semi-group) under Whitney sum, and it forms a semi-ring with multiplication given by the (internal) tensor product of vector bundles over X.

There is a standard construction, called the Grothendieck construction, of an Abelian group G(M ) associated to an Abelian monoid M : one takes the quotient of the free Abelian group generated by the elements of M by the subgroup generated by the set of elements of the form m + n − m ⊕ n, where ⊕ is the sum in M . The evident morphism of Abelian monoids i : M −→ G(M ) is universal: for any homomorphism of monoids f : M −→ G, where G is an Abelian group, there is a unique homomorphism of groups f ˜ f˜ : G(M ) −→ G such that f ˜ f˜ ◦ i = f (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If M is a semi-ring, then its multiplication induces a multiplication on G(M ) such that G(M ) is a ring, called the Grothendieck ring of M . If the semi-ring M is commutative, then the ring G(M ) is commutative (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. The K-theory of X, denoted K(X), is the Grothendieck ring of the semi-ring V ect(X). An element of K(X) is called a virtual bundle over X. We write [ξ] for the element of K(X) determined by a vector bundle ξ. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

we have the function d : V ect(X) −→ Z that sends a vector bundle to the dimension of its restriction to the component of the basepoint ∗. Since d is a homomorphism of semi-rings, it induces a dimension function d : K(X) −→ Z, which is a homomorphism of rings. Since d is an isomorphism when X is a point, d can be identified with the induced map K(X) −→ K(∗). Definition. The reduced K-theory ̃ K̃(X) of a based space X is the kernel of d : K(X) −→ Z. It is an ideal of K(X) and thus a ring without identity. Clearly K(X) ∼ = ∼ = K ̃ K̃(X) × Z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We say that bundles ζ and ξ are stably equivalent if, for a sufficiently large q, the bundles ζ ⊕ εq−m and ξ ⊕ εq−n are equivalent, where m = d(ζ) and n = d(ξ).

Proposition. If ξ : E −→ X is a vector bundle over X, then there is a bundle η over X such that ξ ⊕ η is equivalent to εq for some q. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition. The space BU × Z is a ring space up to homotopy. That is, there are additive and multiplicative H-space structures on BU × Z such that the associativity, commutativity, and distributivity diagrams required of a ring commute up to homotopy.

The study of ring spaces such as this is a relatively new, and quite deep, part of algebraic topology. However, the reader should feel reasonably comfortable with the additive H-space structure on BU . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. K(S 2 ) is generated as a ring by [H] subject to the single relation ([H] − 1)2 = 0. Therefore, as Abelian groups, K(S 2 ) is free on the basis {1, [H]} and ̃ K̃(S 2 ) is free on the basis {1 − [H]}. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Conversely, an isomorphism f from the trivial bundle over S 1 to itself gives a way to glue together the trivial bundles over D and D′ to reconstruct a bundle over S 2 . Say that two such “clutching functions” f are equivalent if the bundles they give rise to are equivalent. A careful analysis of the form of the possible clutching functions f leads to a canonical example in each equivalence class and (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Bott periodicity). For compact spaces X, α : K(X) ⊗ K(S 2 ) −→ K(X × S 2 ) is an isomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The following useful observation applies to any representable functor, not just K-theory. Lemma. For nondegenerately based spaces X and Y , the projections of X × Y on X and on Y and the quotient map X×Y −→ X∧Y induce a natural isomorphism ̃ K̃(X ∧ Y ) ⊕ K ̃ K̃(X) ⊕ K ̃ K̃(Y ) ∼ = ∼ = K ̃ K̃(X × Y ), and ̃ K̃(X ∧ Y ) is the kernel of the map ̃ K̃(X × Y ) −→ ̃ K̃(X) ⊕ K ̃ K̃(Y ) induced by the inclusions of X and Y in X × Y .

Theorem (Bott periodicity). For nondegenerately based compact spaces X, β : ̃ K̃(X) ⊗ K ̃ K̃(S 2 ) −→ K ̃ K̃(X ∧ S 2 ) = K ̃ K̃(Σ 2 X) is an isomorphism.

Since ̃ K̃(S 2 ) ∼ = Z with generator b, the theorem implies that multiplication by the “Bott element” b specifies an isomorphism [X, BU × Z] = ∼ = K ∼ ̃ K̃(X) −→ K ̃ K̃(Σ 2 X) ∼ = ∼ = [X, Ω 2 (BU × Z)] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Bott’s map β can also be proved to be a homotopy equivalence using only basic algebraic topology. Since BU and ΩSU are simply connected spaces of the homotopy types of CW complexes, a relative version of the Hurewicz theorem called the Whitehead theorem shows that β will be a weak equivalence and therefore a homotopy equivalence if it induces an isomorphism on integral homology.

A purely algebraic dualization argument proves that, as a ring, H∗ (BU ) ∼ = ∼ Z[γi |i ≥ 1], = where γi is the image of a generator of H2i (CP ∞ ) under the map induced by the inclusion of CP ∞ = BU (1) in BU (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In any case, it should now be clear that we have a periodic Ω-prespectrum and therefore a generalized cohomology theory represented by it. Definition. The K-theory Ω-prespectrum KU has spaces KU2i = BU ×Z and KU2i+1 = U for all i ≥ 0. The structure maps are given by the canonical homotopy equivalence U ≃ ΩBU = Ω(BU × Z) and the Bott equivalence BU × Z ≃ ΩU . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We have a resulting reduced cohomology theory on based spaces such that ̃ K̃ 2i (X) = K̃(X) and K̃ 2i+1 (X) = K̃(ΣX) for all integers i. This theory has products that are induced by tensor products of bundles over compact spaces and that are induced by suitable maps φ : KUi ∧ KUj −→ KUi+j in general, just as for the cup product in ordinary cohomology. It is standard to view this simply as a Z2 -graded theory with groups ̃ K̃ 0 (X) and K̃ 1 (X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition. Let E0 be the zero section of E. Define the projective bundle π : P (E) −→ X by letting the non-zero complex numbers act on E − E0 by scalar multiplication on fibers and taking the orbit space under this action. Equivalently, the fiber π −1 (x) ⊂ P (E) is the complex projective space of lines through the origin in the fiber ξ −1 (x) ⊂ E. Define the canonical line bundle L(E) over P (E) to be the subbundle of the pullback π ∗ E of ξ along π whose points are the pairs consisting of a line in a fiber of E and a point on that line. Let Q(E) be the quotient bundle π ∗ E/L(E) and let H(E) denote the dual of L(E). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Regard K(P (E)) as a K(X)algebra via π ∗ : K(X) −→ K(P (E)). Theorem (Bott periodicity). Let L be a line bundle over X and let H = H(L ⊕ ε).

It will be based on a generalization to projective bundles of the calculation of H ∗ (CP n ). The proofs of both results are intertwined with the proof of the following “splitting principle,” which allows the deduction of explicit formulas about general bundles from formulas about sums of line bundles.

Theorem (Splitting principle). There is a compact space F (E) and a map p : F (E) −→ X such that p∗ E is a sum of line bundles over F (E) and both p∗ : H ∗ (X; Z) −→ H ∗ (F (E); Z) and p∗ : K(X) −→ K(F (E)) are monomorphisms.

Theorem. Let x = c1 (L(E)) ∈ H 2 (P (E); Z). Then H ∗ (P (E); Z) is the free Theorem. Let x = c1 (L(E)) ∈ H 2 (P (E); Z).

One first a line bundle E, L(E) = E and c1 (E) = c′1 (E) by the definition of x. One first verifies by direct calculation that if E = L1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ln is a sum of line bundles, then ′ 1≤k≤n (x − c1 (Lk )) = 0. This implies that ck (E) is the kth elementary symmetric 1≤k≤n ′ (x − c1 (Lk )) = 0. This implies that ck k (E) is the kth elementary symmetric Q polynomial in the c1 (Lk ). By the Whitney sum formula for the Chern classes, this implies that c′k k (E) = ck (E) in this case (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The following analogue in K-theory of the previous theorem holds. Observe that, since they are continuous operations on complex vector spaces, the exterior powers λk can be applied fiberwise to give natural operations on vector bundles. Theorem. Let H = H(E). Then K(P (E)) is the free K(X)-module on the Theorem. Let H = H(E). Then K(P (E)) is the fre basis 1, [H], . . ., [H]n−1 , and the following formula holds: d t n k=0 (−1) k [H] k [λ k E] = 0.

For line bundles L and L′ , we have c1 (L ⊗ L′ ) = c1 (L) + c1 (L′ ).

Together with some of the facts given in Chapter 23 §7, this has a remarkable application to the study of almost complex structures on spheres.

Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=223" target="_blank">J. Peter May 223</a>)</p>
We then indicate several problems whose solution can be reduced to the question of when such maps f take the value one. Adams’ original solution to the Hopf invariant one problem used secondary cohomology operations in ordinary cohomology and was a critical starting point of modern algebraic topology. The later realization that a problem that required secondary operations in ordinary cohomology could be solved much more simply using primary operations in Ktheory had a profound impact on the further development of the subject.

Definition. Let X be the cofiber of a based map f : S 2n−1 −→ S n , where n ≥ 2. Then X is a CW complex with a single vertex, a single n-cell i, and a single 2n-cell j.

H ̃ H̃ ∗ (X) is free Abelian on generators x = [i] and y = [j]. Define an integer h(f ), the Hopf invariant of f , by x 2 = h(f )y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. If h(f ) = ±1, then n = 2, 4, or 8. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=224" target="_blank">J. Peter May 224</a>)</p>
Theorem. If S n−1 is an H-space, then n = 1, 2, 4, or 8 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=224" target="_blank">J. Peter May 224</a>)</p>
The determination of which spheres are H-spaces has the following implications. Theorem. Let ω : Rn × Rn −→ Rn be a map with a two-sided identity element e 6= 0 and no zero divisors. Then n = 1, 2, 4, or 8. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=226" target="_blank">J. Peter May 226</a>)</p>
Note that ω need not be bilinear, just continuous. Also, it need not have a strict unit; all that is required is that e be a two-sided unit up to homotopy for the restriction of ω to Rn − {0}. Theorem. If S n is parallelizable, then n = 0, 1, 3, or 7. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

suppose that S n is parallelizable, so that its tangent bundle τ is trivial. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=226" target="_blank">J. Peter May 226</a>)</p>
Cobordism theories were introduced shortly after K-theory, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=227" target="_blank">J. Peter May 227</a>)</p>
We shall describe the cobordism of smooth closed manifolds, but this is in fact a particularly elementary example. Other examples include smooth closed manifolds with extra structure on their stable normal bundles: orientation, complex structure, Spin structure, or symplectic structure for example. All of these except the symplectic case have been computed completely. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=227" target="_blank">J. Peter May 227</a>)</p>
The area is pervaded by insights from algebraic topology that are quite mysterious geometrically. For example, the complex cobordism groups turn out to be concentrated in even degrees: every smooth closed manifold of odd dimension with a complex structure on its stable normal bundle is the boundary of a compact manifold (with compatible bundle information). However, there is no geometric understanding of why this should be the case. The analogue with “complex” replaced by “symplectic” is false. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=227" target="_blank">J. Peter May 227</a>)</p>
We consider the problem of classifying smooth closed n-manifolds M . One’s first thought is to try to classify them up to diffeomorphism, but that problem is in principle unsolvable. Thom’s discovery that one can classify such manifolds up to the weaker equivalence relation of “cobordism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We say that two smooth closed nmanifolds M and N are cobordant if there is a smooth compact manifold W whose boundary is the disjoint union of M and N , ∂W = M ∐ N . We write Nn for the set of cobordism classes of smooth closed n-manifolds. It is convenient to allow the empty set ∅ as an n-manifold for every n. Disjoint union gives an addition on the set Nn . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=227" target="_blank">J.

Nn is a vector space over Z2 . Cartesian product of manifolds defines a multiplication Nm × Nn −→ Nm+n . This operation is bilinear, associative, and commutative, and the zero dimensional manifold with a single point provides an identity element. We conclude that N∗ is a graded Z2 -algebra.

Theorem (Thom). N∗ is a polynomial algebra over Z2 on generators ui of dimension i for i > 1 and not of the form 2 r − 1. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

As already stated in our discussion of Stiefel-Whitney numbers, it follows from the proof of the theorem that a manifold is a boundary if and only if its normal Stiefel-Whitney numbers are zero (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem. Two smooth closed n-manifolds are cobordant if and only if their normal Stiefel-Whitney numbers, or equivalently their tangential Stiefel-Whitney numbers, are equal.

Explicit generators ui are known. Write [M ] for the cobordism class of a manifold M . Then we can take u2i = [RP 2i ] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The strategy for the proof of Thom’s theorem is to describe Nn as a homotopy group of a certain Thom space. The homotopy group is a stable one, and it turns out to be computable by the methods of generalized homology theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=228" target="_blank">J. Peter May 228</a>)</p>
and we have the following translation of our problem in manifold theory to a problem in homotopy theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

shall sketch the proof in the next section, where we shall also explain the ring structure on π∗ (T O) that makes it a Z2 -algebra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem (Thom). For sufficiently large q, Nn is isomorphic to πn+q (T O(q)). Therefore Nn ∼ = ∼ = πn (T O). Moreover, N∗ and π∗ (T O) are isomorphic as Z2 -algebras. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=228" target="_blank">J.

Given a smooth closed n-manifold M , we may embed it in Rn+q for q sufficiently large, and we let ν be the normal bundle of the embedding. (By the Whitney embedding theorem, q = n suffices (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J.

Embed M as the zero section of the total space E(ν). Then a standard result in differential topology known as the tubular neighborhood theorem implies that the identity map of M extends to an embedding of E(ν) onto an open neighborhood U of M in R n+q .

The Thom space was tailor made to allow this construction (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=229" target="_blank">J. Peter May 229</a>)</p>
By an implication of Sard’s theorem known as the transversality theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=229" target="_blank">J. Peter May 229</a>)</p>
. In fact, T O is a commutative and associative ring prespectrum in the sense of the following definition. Definition. Let T be a prespectrum. Then T is a ring prespectrum if there are maps η : S 0 −→ T0 and φm,n : Tm ∧ Tn −→ Tm+n such that the following diagrams are homotopy commutative (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=230" target="_blank">J. Peter May 230</a>)</p>
For example, the Eilenberg-Mac Lane Ω-prespectrum of a commutative ring R is an associative and commutative ring prespectrum (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

3. It is denoted HR or sometimes, by abuse, K(R, 0). Similarly, the K-theory Ω-prespectrum is an associative and commutative ring prespectrum. The sphere prespectrum, whose nth space is S n , is another example (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma. If T is an associative ring prespectrum, then π∗ (T ) is a graded ring. If T is commutative, then π∗ (T ) is commutative in the graded sense. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Calculation of the homotopy groups π∗ (T O) proceeds by first computing the homology groups H∗ (T O; Z2 ) and then showing that the stable Hurewicz homomorphism maps π∗ (T O) monomorphically onto an identifiable part of H∗ (T O; Z2 ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=231" target="_blank">J.

Just as we defined the homotopy groups of a prespectrum T by the formula πn (T ) = colim πn+q (Tq ), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=231" target="_blank">J. Peter May 231</a>)</p>
we define the homology and cohomology groups of T with respect to a homology theory k∗ and cohomology theory k ∗ on spaces by the formulas kn (T ) = colim k̃ k̃n+q (Tq ), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=231" target="_blank">J. Peter May 231</a>)</p>
In fact, this definition of cohomology is inappropriate in general, differing from the appropriate definition by a lim 1 error term. However, the definition is correct when k ∗ is ordinary cohomology with coefficients in a field R and each H̃ n+q (Tq ; R) is a finite dimensional vector space over R.

Observe that there is no cup product in H ∗ (T ; R): the maps in the limit system factor through the reduced cohomologies of suspensions, in which cup products are identically zero (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The Hurewicz homomorphisms πn+q (Tq ) −→ ̃ H̃n+q (Tq ; Z) pass to colimits to give the stable Hurewicz homomorphism h : πn (T ) −→ Hn (T ; Z). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If T is an associative and commutative ring prespectrum, then h : π∗ (T ) −→ H∗ (T ; R) is a map of graded commutative rings. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Recall that we have Thom isomorphisms Φq : H n (BO(q)) −→ H ̃ H̃ n+q (T O(q)) obtained by cupping with the Thom class µq ∈ H ̃ H̃ q (T O(q)). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We therefore obtain a “stable Thom isomorphism” Φ : H n (BO) −→ H n (T O) on passage to limits. We have dual homology Thom isomorphisms Φn : H ̃ H̃n+q (T O(q)) −→ Hn (BO(q)) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Since the Steenrod operations are stable and natural, they pass to limits to define natural operations Sq i : H n (T ) −→ H n+i (T ) for i ≥ 0 and prespectra T .

The elements of A are stable mod 2 cohomology operations, and our description of the cohomology of K(Z2 , q)s in Chapter 22 §5 implies that A is in fact the algebra of all stable mod 2 cohomology operations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We think of prespectra as “stable objects” that have associated homotopy, homology, and cohomology groups. Imagine that we have a good category of stable objects, analogous to the category of based spaces, that is equipped with all of the constructions that we have on based spaces: wedges (= coproducts), colimits, products, limits, suspensions, loops, homotopies, cofiber sequences, fiber sequences, smash products, function objects, and so forth. Let us call the stable objects in our imagined category “spectra” and call the category of such objects S . We have in mind an analogy with the notions of presheaf and sheaf.

The homology and cohomology groups of Σ∞ X are the (reduced) homology and cohomology groups of X; the homotopy groups of Σ ∞ X are the stable homotopy groups of X.

The Whitehead and cellular approximation theorems hold, and every spectrum X admits a CW approximation ΓX −→ X. We define the set [X, Y ] of morphisms X −→ Y in h̄ h̄S to be the set of homotopy classes of maps ΓX −→ ΓY . This is a stable category in the sense that the functor Σ : h̄ h̄S −→ h h̄ h̄S is an equivalence of categories. More explicitly, the natural maps X −→ ΩΣX and ΣΩX −→ X are isomorphisms in h h̄ h̄S .

In particular, up to isomorphism, every object in the category h̄ h̄S is a suspension, hence a double suspension (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This implies that each [X, Y ] is an Abelian group and composition is bilinear. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=239" target="_blank">J. Peter May 239</a>)</p>
so that cofiber sequences and fiber sequences are equivalent. Therefore cofiber sequences give rise to long exact sequences of homotopy groups. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The homotopy groups of wedges and products of spectra are given by topy π∗ ( i roups of Xi ) = i edges and product π∗ (Xi ) and π∗ ( i of spectr Xi ) = i π∗ (Xi ).

Therefore, if only Theref map i e, if only Q Xi −→ fi i nitely many πq (Xi ) a Xi is an isomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A spectrum E represents a homology theory E∗ and a cohomology theory E ∗ specified in terms of smash products and function spectra by Eq (X) = πq (X ∧ E) and E q (X) = π−q F (X, E) ∼ = ∼ = [X, Σ q E].

Moreover, every homology or cohomology theory on h h̄ h̄S is so represented by some spectrum E. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Its only non-zero homotopy group is π0 (Hπ) = π, and the Hurewicz homomorphism maps this group isomorphically onto H0 (Hπ; Z). When π = Z2 , the natural map H0 (HZ2 ; Z) −→ H0 (HZ2 ; Z2 ) is also an isomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Returning to our motivating example, we write M O for the “Thom spectrum” that arises from the Thom prespectrum T O. The reader may sympathize with a student who claimed that M O stands for “Mythical Object.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=239" target="_blank">J. Peter May 239</a>)</p>
However, these early constructions were far more primitive than our outline suggests. While they gave a satisfactory stable category, the underlying category of spectra did not have products, limits, and function objects, and its smash product was not associative, commutative, or unital. In fact, a fully satisfactory category of spectra was not constructed until 1995. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=240" target="_blank">J. Peter May 240</a>)</p>
Definition. A spectrum E is a prespectrum such that the adjoints σ̃ : En −→ ΩEn+1 of the structure maps σ : ΣEn −→ En+1 are homeomorphisms. A map f : T −→ T ′ of prespectra is a sequence of maps fn : Tn −→ Tn′ such that σ ′ n′ ◦ Σfn = fn+1 ◦ σn for all n. A map f : E −→ E ′ of spectra is a map between E and E ′ regarded as prespectra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=240" target="_blank">J. Peter May 240</a>)</p>
We define wedges and colimits of spectra by first performing the construction on the prespectrum level and then applying the functor L. If we start with spectra and construct products or limits spacewise, then the result is again a spectrum; that is, limits of spectra are the limits of their underlying prespectra. Thus the category S is complete and cocomplete. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=240" target="_blank">J. Peter May 240</a>)</p>
We now have cylinders E ∧ I+ and thus can define homotopies between maps of spectra. Similarly we have cones CE = E ∧ I (where I has basepoint 1), suspensions ΣE = E ∧ S 1 , path spectra F (I, E) (where I has (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=240" target="_blank">J. Peter May 240</a>)</p>
Similarly, we define the smash product T ∧X and function prespectrum F (X, T ) of a based space X and a prespectrum T spacewise. For a spectrum E, we define E ∧ X by applying L to the prespectrum level construction; the prespectrum F (X, E) is already a spectrum. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=240" target="_blank">J. Peter May 240</a>)</p>
basepoint 0), and loop spectra ΩE = F (S 1 , E). The development of cofiber and fiber sequences proceeds exactly as for based spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=241" target="_blank">J. Peter May 241</a>)</p>
The essential point is that homotopy and homology commute with colimits. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=241" target="_blank">J. Peter May 241</a>)</p>
It is not true that cohomology converts colimits to limits in general, because of lim 1 error terms, and this is one reason that our definition of the cohomology of prespectra via limits is inappropriate except under restrictions that guarantee the vanishing of lim 1 terms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=241" target="_blank">J. Peter May 241</a>)</p>
We define QX = ∪Ωq Σq X, and we find that the nth space of Σ∞ X is QΣn X. It should be apparent that the homotopy groups of the space QX are the stable homotopy groups of X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=241" target="_blank">J. Peter May 241</a>)</p>
For example, the homotopy groups of the K-theory spectrum are Z for every even integer and zero for every odd integer (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. Peter May/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology (628)/A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology - J. Peter May.pdf#page=241" target="_blank">J. Peter May 241</a>)</p>
Thus, if we have a prespectrum T whose invariants we are interested in, such as an Eilenberg-Mac Lane Ω-prespectrum or the K-theory Ω-prespectrum, then we can construct a spectrum LKT that has the same invariants (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

there is also considerable payoff in explicit concrete calculations, as the computation of π∗ (M O) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

. Localization and completion; rational homotopy theory Since the early 1970s, it has been standard practice in algebraic topology to localize and complete topological spaces, and not just their algebraic invariants, at sets of primes and then to study the subject one prime at a time, or rationally. Two of the basic original references are: D. Sullivan. The genetics of homotopy theory and the Adams conjecture. Annals of Math. 100(1974), 1–79. A.K. Bousfield and D.M. Kan. Homotopy limits, completions, and localizations. Lecture Notes in Mathematics Vol. 304. Springer-Verlag. 1972.

Adams’ book cited in §16 gives a spectral sequence for the computation of stable homotopy groups in terms of generalized cohomology theories.

A real vector bundle £ over B consists of the following: 1) a topological space E = E(£) called the total space, 2) a (continuous) map 7: E » B called the projection map, and 3) for each b ¢ B the structure of a vector space” over the real numbers in the set 7~1(b).

These must satisfy the following restriction: Condition of local triviality. For each point b of B there should exist a neighborhood U C B, an integer n> 0, and a homeomorphism h:Ux RP > 71) so that, for each b ¢ U, the correspondence x + h(b, x) defines an isomorphism between the vector space R™ and the vector space 7 1(b).

DEFINITION. A Euclidean vector bundle is a real vector bundle ¢& together with a continuous function §: E() > R such that the restriction of pu to each fiber of ¢ is positive definite and quadratic.

ote. In Steenrod’s terminology a Euclidean metric on & gives-rise to a reduction of the structural group of £ from the full linear group to the orthogonal group.

More generally a smooth map f:M -» N between smooth manifolds is called an immersion if the Jacobian Df, : DM, -> DN¢(x) maps the tangent space DM, injectively (i.e., with kernel zero) for each x ¢ M.

the simplicial classifying construction and simplicial loop construction, is omitted and readers who intend to make large use of simplicial sets will need to consult a book devoted explicitly to that subject (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Paul Selick/Introduction to Homotopy Theory (663)/Introduction to Homotopy Theory - Paul Selick.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Paul Selick 14</a>)</p>
simplicial sets are used primarily in discussing localization (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Paul Selick/Introduction to Homotopy Theory (663)/Introduction to Homotopy Theory - Paul Selick.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Paul Selick 14</a>)</p>

Basic definitions, classification theorems, and Milnor’s construction are given. A student of algebraic topology would be well advised to read more on this subject, for example in Milnor’s “Characteristic Classes” [MS].

For the first Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence we take a very algebraic approach closely related to Eilenberg and Moore’s original proof. This allows the demonstration of homological techniques useful in other contexts and also demonstrates clearly how much information is lost when one passes from the singular chain complex on a space to its homology.

In contrast the local structure of a symplectic manifold is, by Darboux’s theorem, always equivalent to the standard structure on Euclidean space. Hence there cannot be any local invariants in symplectic geometry. This should be contrasted with Riemannian geometry where the curvature provides such local invariants. These local invariants severely restrict the group of isometries and give rise to an infinite dimensional variety of nonequivalent Riemannian metrics.

Here are some vaguely worded but typical questions: (1) Which manifolds support a symplectic structure? What symplectic invariants are there to distinguish one from another? (ii) Are there any special distinguishing features of Hamiltonian flows on arbitrary compact energy surfaces in Euclidean space? For example, must they always have a periodic orbit? (iii) Must a symplectomorphism always have ‘a lot’ of fixed points? (iv) What can be said about the shape of a symplectic image of a ball? Can it be long and thin, or must it always be in some sense round? (v) Is there a geometric way to understand the fact that a symplectic structure makes 2-dimensional measurements?

Consider a system whose configurations are described by points x in Fuclidean space R® which move along trajectories z(t). As we shall see in Lemma 1.1 below, the assumption that these paths minimize some action functional gives rise to a system of n second-order differential equations called the Euler-Lagrange equations of the variational problem.

We will then show how these equations can be transformed into a Hamiltonian system of 2n first-order equations.

As alwaysin a variational problem, the Euler-Lagrange equations correspond to critical points of the functional under consideration rather than to actual minima or maxima.

It has long been suspected that the group of symplectomorphisms is significantly smaller than that of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=39" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 39</a>)</p>
However, there was po result which pinpointed a difference until Gromov proved his celebrated nonsqueezing theorem in 1985. This says that a standard symplectic ball cannot be symplectically embedded into a thin cylinder. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=39" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 39</a>)</p>
The minimum number of critical points of a function on a compact manifold M is a topological invariant of that manifold. The minimum is taken over all smooth functions f : M — R and we denote it by Crit(M). It is obvious that Crit(M) > 2 since every nonconstant function must have a distinct maximum and minimum.

The latter implies that the number of fixed (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dusa McDuff/Introduction to Symplectic Topology (672)/Introduction to Symplectic Topology - Dusa McDuff.pdf#page=43" target="_blank">Dusa McDuff 43</a>)</p>
points of a map ¢ : M — M which is homotopic to the identity is greater than or equal to the number of zeros of a vector field on M (when these are counted with appropriate multiplicities) which is the alternating sum of the Betti numbers.

The fact that the Arnold conjecture gives sharper estimates for the number of fixed points than the Lefschetz fixed point theorem is a global version of the observation that a function on a manifold must have more critical points than a vector field (or 1-form) must have zeros.

The latter statement has a direct interpretation in symplectic geometry since the differential of a function is an exact Lagrangian submanifold of the cotangent bundle and the critical points are the intersections with the zero section.

What if the columns of A are not orthonormal? In the next section we will learn a method for finding an orthonormal basis for R(A). From this method we will obtain a factorization of A into a product QR, where Q has an orthonormal set of column vectors and R is upper triangular.

The pioneering work of Pontryagin and Thom forged a deep connection between certain geometric problems (such as the classiﬁcation of manifolds) and homotopy theory, through the medium of the Thom space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Budyak 6</a>)</p>
Computations become possible upon stabilization, and this provided some of the ﬁrst and most compelling examples of “spectra.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Budyak 6</a>)</p>
This international tradition was continued with the more or less simultaneous work by Novikov and Milnor on complex cobordism, and later by Quillen. More recently Dennis Sullivan opened the way to the study of “manifolds with singularities,” a study taken up most forcefully by the Russian school, notably by Vershinin, Botvinnik, and Rudyak. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Budyak 6</a>)</p>
There is a ﬁne introduction to the stable homotopy category. The subtle and increasingly important issue of phantom maps is addressed here with care. Equally careful is the treatment of orientability (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Budyak 6</a>)</p>
The contents of this book are concentrated around Thom spaces (spectra), orientability theory and (co)bordism theory (including (co)bordism with singularities), framed by (co)homology theories and spectra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">Budyak 10</a>)</p>
we consider the (inter)connections between geometry and homotopy theory, since Thom spectra and related matters are now the main tools for this interplay (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Budyak 11</a>)</p>
of the ﬁrst results in this area was the Gauss–Bonnet formula, relating a geometrical invariant (the curvature) to a homotopical one (the Euler characteristic). Proceeding, we can recall the Riemann–Roch Theorem, the Poincaré integrality theory, relationships between critical points of a smooth function on a smooth manifold and its homotopy type (Lusternik– Schnirelmann, Morse), the de Rham Theorem, etc. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Budyak 11</a>)</p>
The term “cohomology theory” is used for what was previously called “generalized” or “extraordinary” cohomology theory, i.e., for functors which satisfy all the Eilenberg– Steenrod axioms except the dimension axioms. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Budyak 11</a>)</p>
Every homology theory h∗ (−) yields a so-called dual cohomology theory h ∗ (−), and vice versa. They are connected via the equality  h  h i (X) =  h  hn−i (Y ) where Y is n-dual to X (and tilde denotes the reduced (co)homology). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Budyak 11</a>)</p>
Thom spaces. The Thom space T ξ of a locally trivial Rn -bundle ξ = {p : E → B} is deﬁned as follows. Let ξ • be the S n -bundle obtained from ξ by the ﬁberwise one-point compactiﬁcation, and let E • be the total space of ξ . Then the “inﬁnities” of the ﬁbers form a section s : B → E • , and we deﬁne T ξ := E • /s(B). Furthermore, the Thom space of a spherical ﬁbration {p : E → B} is the cone C(p) of the projection (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)</p>
p. For example, the Thom space of the Rn -bundle over a point is S n , the Thom space of the open Möbius band (considered as the R1 -bundle over S 1 ) is the real projective plane RP 2 , the Thom space of the Hopf bundle S 3 → S 2 (with ﬁber S 1 ) is the complex projective plane CP 2 . We use Thom’s notation M On for the Thom space T γ n of the universal n-dimensional vector bundle γ n over the classifying space BOn , i.e., M On := T γ n ; e.g., M O1 = RP ∞ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)</p>
.C. Whitehead observed the importance of the structure on the normal bundle in classifying structures on manifolds. It turns out that Thom spaces establish an adequate context for this. Namely, for every closed smooth manifold M n , the set of (diﬀeomorphism classes of) smooth manifolds homotopy equivalent to M is controlled by the group πn+N (T ν), where ν is the normal bundle of an embedding of M in Rn+N with N large enough (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)</p>
This is closely related to the Milnor–Spanier–Atiyah Duality Theorem, which asserts that T ν and M/∂M are stable N -dual for every compact manifold M . This theorem clariﬁes connections between manifolds and their normal bundles and enables us to transmit properties of bundles to properties of manifolds. For example, we have the Thom isomorphism ϕ : H i (X; Z/2) →  H  H i+n (T ξ; Z/2) for every locally trivial Rn -bundle ξ over a space X, and the above theorem transforms it to the Poincaré duality H i (M ; Z/2) ∼ = ∼ = Hn−i (M, ∂M ; Z/2) for every compact n-dimensional manifold M . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)</p>
Turning to another example, I recall the Thom formula wi (ξ) = ϕ −1 Sq i uξ where ξ is an n-dimensional vector bundle over a space X, wi (ξ) is its i-th Stiefel–Whitney class, ϕ : H i (X; Z/2) →  H  H i+n (T ξ; Z/2) is the Thom isomorphism and uξ ∈ H (T ξ; Z/2) is the Thom class of ξ. This formula expands n a geometric invariant (the Stiefel–Whitney class) via the Steenrod operation which is a purely homotopic thing. Moreover, we can use the formula in order to deﬁne the Stiefel–Whitney classes of spherical ﬁbrations. In particular, it becomes clear that the Stiefel–Whitney classes are invariants of the ﬁber homotopy type of a vector bundle (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Budyak 12</a>)</p>
Generalizing, we can consider an arbitrary natural transformation τ : h ∗ → k ∗ of cohomology theories instead of Sq i . Then, under suitable conditions on ξ, there is a generalized Thom class u hξ ∈  h  h n (T ξ) and a generalized Thom isomorphism ϕk : k i (X) →  k  k i+n (T ξ), and so we can form the class K(ξ) = ϕ −1 k τ u h ξ which is an analogue and generalization of the Stiefel–Whitney class (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)</p>
So, we have a large source of invariants of Rn -bundles. For example, the Todd genus and the  A  genus are particular cases of this construction. Moreover, the wellA known integrality theorems which are related to Todd and  A  genera can be A generalized for the class K (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)</p>
Pontrjagin [1] proved that if a manifold bounds then all its characteristic numbers are trivial. In particular, RP 2 does not bound because w2 (RP 2 ) = 0. So, N2 = 0, i.e., some groups Nk are non-trivial (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)</p>
Well, but how to compute Nk ? Clearly, N0 = Z/2, N1 = 0. Using the classiﬁcation of closed surfaces, one can prove that N2 = Z/2: every orientable surface bounds, and every non-orientable surface either bounds or is bordant to RP 2 ; and RP 2 does not bound (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)</p>
Rokhlin [1] proved that N3 = 0, using complicated and tricky geometry. The further computation of Nk looked absolutely hopeless; however this was done by Thom [2] via an exciting and successful application of homotopy theory. Namely, Thom proved that N k = πk+N (M ON ) for N large enough (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)</p>

where N∗ = ⊕Nk is the graded ring with the multiplication induced by the direct product of manifolds (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Budyak 13</a>)</p>
The above constructions can be generalized: we can consider oriented manifolds or, more generally, manifolds equipped with some extra structures. As above, there arise certain bordism groups, and they can be interpreted as homotopy groups of certain Thom spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Budyak 14</a>)</p>
We use a category of spectra proposed by Adams [5]. So, a spectrum E is a sequence {En , sn }∞ n=−∞ of pointed CW -spaces En and pointed CW embeddings sn : SEn → En+1 where S denotes the pointed suspension. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Budyak 14</a>)</p>
(1) For every pointed space X we have the spectrum Σ ∞ X = {S n X, sn } where sn : SS n X → S n+1 X is the identity map. (2) For every pointed space X and every spectrum E = {En , sn } we have the spectrum X ∧ E = {X ∧ En , 1 ∧ sn }.

(3) Let θ 1 be the trivial 1-dimensional vector bundle over BOn , and let the map BOn → BOn+1 (assuming it to be an embedding) classify the vector bundle γ n ⊕ θ1 . Then we have a map sn : T (γ n ⊕ θ1 ) → T γ n+1 . Moreover, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Budyak 14</a>)</p>
Clearly, Nk = Nk (pt). Moreover, N k (X) = πk+N (X + ∧ M ON ) for N large enough, where X + is the disjoint union of the space X and a point. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Budyak 14</a>)</p>
one can prove that T (γ n ⊕ θ1 ) = ST γ n = SM On , and so we have the Thom spectrum M O = {M On , sn (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Budyak 15</a>)</p>
Given a spectrum E, we have the homomorphisms hk,n : πk (En ) → πk+1 (SEn ) (sn )∗ (sn )∗ −−−→ πk+1 (En+1 ). We deﬁne the homotopy group πk (E) to be the direct limit of the sequence ··· − → πk+n (En ) hk+n,n hk+n,n −−−−→ πk+n+1 (En+1 ) − → ··· , i.e., πk (E) = lim n→∞ πi+n (En ).

N k = πk (M O), Nk (X) = πk (X + ∧ M O) and so get rid of “N large enough” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Budyak 15</a>)</p>
Every spectrum E yields a homology theory E∗ (−) and a cohomology theory E ∗ (−) by the formulae Ei (X) := lim n→∞ πi+n (X + ∧ En ), E i (X) := lim n→∞ [S n X + , Ei+n ]. Moreover, E∗ (−) and E ∗ (−) are dual to each other. Conversely, every (co)homology theory can be represented by a spectrum via the above formulae.

Note that, in particular, the spectrum M O yields the bordism (resp. cobordism) theory N∗ (−) (resp. N∗ (−)).

Orientability.

Similarly, we deﬁne a locally trivial Rn -bundle ξ over a connected base to be orientable if H n (T ξ) = Z, and an orientation of ξ is a generator of the group H n (T ξ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Budyak 16</a>)</p>
For example, an h-orientation of an Rn -bundle ξ is a suitable element uξ ∈  h  h n (T ξ), an horientation of a closed manifold M n is an element [M ] ∈ hn (M n ).

Furthermore, one can develop an elegant theory of characteristic classes taking values in h∗ (−) provided that all complex vector bundles are horientable; these classes generalize the classical Chern classes.

As the last example, we mention that general orientabilty theory provides a formal group input to algebraic topology; this matter is completely degenerate for classical cohomology, and so this remarkable theory was able to appear only under the general approac (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Budyak 16</a>)</p>

(Co)bordism with singularities. (Co)bordism with singularities is now a common and convenient notion, being a favorite tool as well as subject of research in algebraic topology. Roughly speaking, we take a class of manifolds and extend it to a class of suitable polyhedra (manifolds with singularities) where a notion of a boundary is reasonably deﬁned (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Budyak 16</a>)</p>
Moreover, the famous Morava k-theories are also constructed as certain cobordism with singularities (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Budyak 17</a>)</p>
ories are also constructed as certain cobordism with singularities. I also want to mention an application of (co)bordism with singularities to the topological quantum ﬁeld theory: for example, the elliptic (co)homology can be constructed as (co)bordism with singularities (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Budyak 17</a>)</p>
Finally, (co)bordism with singularities gives a natural geometric ﬂavor to algebraic or homotopical matters. For example, the Adams resolution of certain spectra can be interpreted in terms of (co)bordism with singularities, and this enables us to get useful information about some classical (co)bordism theories, like M SU and M Sp (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Budyak 17</a>)</p>

The paper Thom [2] made a revolution and formed the contemporary paradigm of algebraic topology, and it freshly demonstrated the power and usefulness of the relations between homotopy theory and geometry. In order to exhibit relatively recent advantages of this matter, I just write down a list (unavoidably incomplete) of certain geometric problems which were (partially or completely) solved via an application of homotopy theory. 1 (1) When can a manifold M be immersed in a manifold N , and how can one classify these immersions? (Smale [1], Hirsch [1].) (2) When can a homology class in a space be realized by a map of a closed manifold? (Thom [2].) (3) When is a closed manifold a boundary of a compact manifold with boundary? (Thom [2].) (4) Which spaces are homotopy equivalent to closed smooth manifolds? (Browder [1,2], Novikov [2,3].) (5) How can one classify manifolds up to diﬀeomorphism (PL isomorphism, homeomorphism)? (Smale [1], Kervaire–Milnor [1], Browder [1,2], Novikov [2,3], Hirsch–Mazur [1], Sullivan [1], Kirby–Siebenmann [1], Freedman [1], Donaldson [1].) (6) How many pointwise linearly independent tangent vector ﬁelds exist on the n-dimensional sphere? (Adams [3].) (7) Which smooth manifolds admit a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature?

The category consisting of sets (as objects) and functions (as morphisms) is denoted by E ns. The category of pointed sets and pointed functions is denoted by E ns• .

partially ordered set, or a poset, is a quasi-ordered set with the following condition: if λ ≤ μ ≤ λ then λ = μ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Budyak 20</a>)</p>
A chain in a poset is a family {ai } such that, for every pair i, j of indices, either ai ≤ aj or aj ≤ ai . An upper bound of the chain is any a such that a i ≤ a for every i. A poset is called inductive if every chain in it has an upper bound.

K → E ns is represented by a certain object B of K if there exists a natural equivalence F ∼ = TB . In this case B is called a classifying or representing object for F . Furthermore, F is called representable if it can be represented by some B.

1.4. Deﬁnition. We say that a contravariant functor F : K → E ns is represented by a certain object B of K if there exists a natu (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Budyak 20</a>)</p>
Let F, G : K → E ns be represented by B, C respectively. It is obvious that every morphism f : B → C yields a natural transformation Tf : TB → TC and hence F → G. The converse is also true. ∼ = ∼ = ∼ = ∼ = 1.5. Lemma (Yoneda). Fix natural equivalences b : F −→ TB , c : G −→ TC . For every natural transformation ϕ : F → G there exists a morphism f : B → C such that for every object X of K the diagram ϕ F (X) −−−−→ G(X) ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ b T f T Tf B (X) −−−−→ TC (X) commutes, and such a morphism f is unique. In particular, the representing object B for F is determined by F uniquely up to isomorphism.

The category of abelian groups and homomorphisms is denoted by A G . Note that the usual direct product of abelian groups is the categorical product in A G , while the usual direct sum is the categorical coproduct in A G .

In algebraic context, we reserve the word “unit” for the neutral element of a monoid (group). In particular, the multiplicative identity element of a ring is also called the unit.

Given a commutative ring R, we denote by R[x, y, . . . , z] the polynomial ring of indeterminates x, y, . . . , z. The corresponding power series ring is denoted by R[[x, y, . . . , z]]. If R is a graded ring, we assume that x, y, . . . , z are homogeneous indeterminates. Furthermore, ΛR (x, y, . . . , z) denotes the free exterior algebra (with a unit) over R of indeterminates x, y, . . . , z, and for a graded R we assume that x, y, . . . , z have odd degrees. We use the notation Λ(x, y, . . . , z) for the ring ΛZ (x, y, . . . , z).

Let ρ : A → B be a ring homomorphism, and let M be a right Amodule. The homomorphism ρ turns B into a left A-module ρ B, where a·b = ρ(a)b for a ∈ A, b ∈ B, cf. Cartan–Eilenberg [1]. We can therefore form the tensor product over A of A-modules M, B. This tensor product is denoted by M ⊗ρ B (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=21" target="_blank">Budyak 21</a>)</p>
(a) Let K be a category. A direct system over Λ, or brieﬂy, a direct Λsystem, in K is a covariant functor M : Λ → K . In other words, M is a family M = {Mλ , j λμ }λ , μ ∈ Λ, where Mλ ∈ K and where jλμ : Mμ → Mλ for μ ≤ λ are morphisms such that jλμ jμν = jλν for ν ≤ μ ≤ λ and jλλ = 1Mλ . (b) A morphism f : {Mλ , jλμ } → {Nλ , hμλ } of direct Λ-systems is a natural transformation of functors, i.e., a family {fλ : Mλ → Nλ } with hμλ fμ = fλ jλμ .

2.4. Deﬁnition. Let Λ be a quasi-ordered set, and let {Aλ }λ∈Λ be a direct Λsystem of abelian groups. Let iλ : Aλ → ⊕λ Aλ be the inclusion, and let B ⊂ ⊕λ Aλ be the subgroup generated by all elements of the form (iμ aμ − iλ jλμ aμ ). The quotient group (⊕λ Aλ )/B is called the direct limit of the direct system {Aλ } and is denoted by −→{Aλ }. lim (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">Budyak 22</a>)</p>
2.5. Theorem. Let G be an abelian group, and let ϕλ : Aλ → G be a family of homomorphisms such that ϕμ = ϕλ jλμ for every μ ≤ λ. Then there exists a homomorphism ϕ : −→{Aλ } → G such that ϕkλ = ϕλ for every λ. lim (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">Budyak 22</a>)</p>
Given two pairs (X, A), (Y, B) of spaces and a map f : A → B, the space X ∪f Y is deﬁned to be the quotient space (X Y )/ ∼, where ∼ is the smallest equivalence relation generated by the following relation: a ∼ b if f (a) = b for a ∈ A, b ∈ B. We say that the space X ∪f Y is obtained from X by adjoining, or gluing, Y via f . For instance, if Y = pt = B then X ∪f Y ∼ = X/A.

A triad (X; A, B) is a topological space and two of its closed subspaces A, B such that X = A ∪ B. A ﬁltration of a topological space X is a sequence {· · · ⊂ X0 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Xn ⊂ · · · ⊂ X} such that: (1) X = ∪n Xn . (2) Every Xn is closed in X. (3) X inherits the direct limit topology, i.e., U is open in X iﬀ U ∩ Xn is open in Xn for every n.

Given a space X, we denote by X + the disjoint union of X and a point, and the added point is assumed to be the base point.

Algebraic topologists prefer to deal with “nice” spaces, such as CW spaces. However, a class of spaces in which algebraic topologists work should be closed under standard operations which topologists use. In other words, the suitable category of spaces should be large enough to accommodate operations and small enough to rule out pathologies at the same time. One such category was suggested by Steenrod [2] and improved by McCord [1]3 , and is known as the category of weak Hausdorﬀ compactly generated spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Budyak 24</a>)</p>
3.2. Deﬁnition. (a) A topological space X is called weak Hausdorﬀ if, for every map ϕ : C → X of a compact space C, the set ϕ(C) is closed in X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Budyak 24</a>)</p>
(b) A subset U of a topological space X is called compactly open if ϕ−1 (U ) is open for every map ϕ : C → X of a compact space C. A topological space X is called compactly generated if each of its compactly open sets is open.

Note that every point of a weak Hausdorﬀ space is closed, and that every Hausdorﬀ space is weak Hausdorﬀ. Thus, the weak Hausdorﬀ property lies between T1 and T2 .

Generally speaking, the usual Cartesian product of two spaces from W is not in W . See Dowker [1], §5. Nevertheless, the category W admits products (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">Budyak 26</a>)</p>
3.6. Deﬁnition. Given a family {Xi } of topological spaces, we deﬁne their compactly generated direct product  c Xi := k Xi i i  where is the usual Cartesian product of topological spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">Budyak 26</a>)</p>
Deﬁne the compact-open topology as follows: let ϕ : C → X be a map of a compact space C, and let U be an open set in Y . We denote by W (ϕ, U ) the set of all maps f : X → Y such that f ϕ(C) ⊂ U . Then the family {W (ϕ, U )} for all such pairs (ϕ, U ) forms a subbasis of the compact-open topology on the set of maps from X to Y .

(c) The loop space Ω(X, ∗) of a pointed space (X, ∗) is just the pointed space (X, ∗)(S 1 ,∗) where S 1 is the circle.

3.11. Convention. Throughout the book we will assume that all spaces belong to W unless somthing else is said explicitly, i.e., the word “space” means “weak Hausdorﬀ compactly generated space”.

3.12. Basic homotopy theory. (a) Two maps f, g : X → Y are called homotopic if there is a map (homotopy, or deformation) H : X × I → Y such that H|X × {0} = f and H|X × {1} = (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Budyak 28</a>)</p>
(b) A map f : X → Y is called a homotopy equivalence if there is a map g : Y → X such that gf  1X and f g  1Y . In this case we say that f and g are homotopy inverse to each other. Two spaces X, Y are called homotopy equivalent if there is a homotopy equivalence X → Y , and we write X  Y . The homotopy type of a space X is the class of all spaces homotopy equivalent to X.

(c) By saying that two maps f, g : (X, A) → (Y, B) are homotopic we mean that there exists a homotopy (X × I, A × I) → (Y, B). Furthermore, we say that two maps f, g : (X, A) → (Y, B) are homotopic relative to A, and write f  g rel A, if there is a homotopy H : f  g such that H(a, t) = f (a) for every a ∈ A, t ∈ I (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Budyak 28</a>)</p>

3.14. Deﬁnition. Let H W denote the category whose objects are the same as those of W but whose morphisms are the homotopy classes of maps. Clearly, every diagram in W yields a diagram in H W . We say that a diagram in W is homotopy commutative if the corresponding diagram in H W is commutative (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Budyak 28</a>)</p>
(a) The mapping cylinder, or just the cylinder, of f is the space M f := X × [0, 1] ∪f Y, f where f is considered as the map X × {0} = X − → Y . Recall that there is a standard deformation F : M f × I → Y where F ((x, t), s) = (x, st) if (x, t) ∈ X × (0, 1] and s > 0 F ((x, t), 0) = f (x) if (x, t) ∈ X × (0, 1] F (y, s) = y if y ∈ Y.    Note that F  M f × {0} : M f → Y is a retraction and F   M f × {1} = 1Mf , i.e., Y is a deformation retract of M f .

(b) The mapping cone, or the coﬁber, or just the cone, of f is the space Cf := M f /(X × {1}). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">Budyak 29</a>)</p>
3.18. Deﬁnition.

For instance, Cf is (homeomorphic to) the double mapping cylinder of f the diagram Y ← −X − → pt.

(b) The mapping cone of the constant map X → pt is called the suspension over a space X and denoted by SX (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Budyak 30</a>)</p>

(c) The obvious injective maps (Xi , xi ) → Xi , ∗ yield an injective map   (∨i Xi , ∗) → Xi , ∗ . Generally speaking, this map is not closed, but it is closed for a ﬁnite set of spaces.

3.23. Deﬁnition. (a) The reduced mapping cylinder of a pointed map f : (X, ∗) → (Y, ∗) is the space M f = (X × [0, 1] ∪f Y )/(∗ × [0, 1]). Note that the base points of X and Y yield the same point ∗ ∈ M f ; we agree that ∗ is the base point of M f .

(b) The reduced mapping cone of f is deﬁned to be Cf = M f /(X × {1}). It is a pointed space in the obvious way: its base point is the image of the base point of M f .

(c) The reduced mapping cone of the constant map (X, ∗) → (pt, ∗) is called the reduced suspension over a space X and denoted by SX.

3.24. Deﬁnition. Given a pair (X, A), the inclusion i : A → X is called a coﬁbration if it satisﬁes the homotopy extension property, i.e., given maps g : X → Y and F : A × I → Y such that F |A × {0} = g|A, there is a map G : X × I → Y such that G|X × {0} = g and G|A × I = F . In this case we also say that (X, A) is a coﬁbered pair.

3.25. Proposition. (i) (X, A) is a coﬁbered pair iﬀ every map h : X × {0} ∪ A × I → Y can be extended to a map X × I → Y . (ii) (X, A) is a coﬁbered pair iﬀ X × {0} ∪ A × I is a retract of X × I (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=33" target="_blank">Budyak 33</a>)</p>
3.26. Proposition. (i) For every map f : X → Y , the inclusion i : X = X × {1} → M f is a coﬁbration. In particular, every map is homotopy equivalent to a coﬁbration. (ii) Let (X, A) be a coﬁbered pair. Then Ci  X/A. (iii) Let (X, A) be a coﬁbered pair. If A is contractible then the collapsing map c : X → X/A is a homotopy equivalence.

3.28. Deﬁnition. A pointed space (X, x0 ) is called well-pointed if (X, {x0 }) is a coﬁbered pair.

3.29. Lemma (Puppe [1]). Let f : (X, x0 ) → (Y, y0 ) be a pointed map of well-pointed spaces. If f : X → Y is a homotopy equivalence then f : (X, x0 ) → (Y, y0 ) is a pointed homotopy equivalence.

(c) A long coﬁber sequence is a sequence (ﬁnite or not) ··· − → Xi − → Xi+1 − → Xi+2 − → ··· where every pair of adjacent morphisms forms a coﬁber sequence.

(a) A strict coﬁber sequence is a diagram A − →B − →C where u : A → B is a map and v is the canonical inclusion as in (3.17). f g (b) A sequence X − →Y − → Z is called a coﬁber sequence if there exists a homotopy commutative diagram f g X −−−−→ Y −−−−→ Z ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ c ⏐ a b c u v A −−−−→ B −−−−→ C such that all the vertical arrows are homotopy equivalences and the bottom row is a strict coﬁber sequenc (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=36" target="_blank">Budyak 36</a>)</p>
3.39. Proposition. Let f : X → Y be an arbitrary map of pointed spaces, and let g : Y → Cf = Z be the canonical inclusion. Then C(g)  SX = S 1 ∧ X. Moreover, there is a long coﬁber sequence n f Sn f g Sf Sg Sn f Sn g X− →Y − →Z− → SX −−→ SY −→ · · · − → S n X −−→ S n Y −−→ · · · .

Proposition 3.39 was originally proved by Puppe [1]. Because of this, the long coﬁber sequence is often refered to as the Puppe sequence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Budyak 37</a>)</p>
Recall that a map f : X → Y of CW -complexes is called cellular if f (X (n) ) ⊂ Y (n) for every n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Budyak 37</a>)</p>
3.41. Theorem. (i) Let i : X (n) → X be the inclusion. Then i∗ : π i (X (n) , ∗) → πi (X, ∗) is an isomorphism for i < n and an epimorphism for i = n. (ii) Every map f : X → Y of CW -complexes is homotopic to a cellular map. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Budyak 37</a>)</p>
We recall that i : A → X is a coﬁbration for every CW -pair (X, A). In particular, every pointed CW -space is well-pointed, and so we can safely omit base points from notation. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Budyak 37</a>)</p>
Every CW -space is Hausdorﬀ (and so weak Hausdorﬀ) and compactly generated. Thus, when we talk about products (or smash products) of CW complexes we follow 3.6. Then the direct product X × Y and the smash product X ∧ Y of two CW -spaces X, Y are also CW -spaces. Note that, for every cellular map f : X → Y , the spaces M f and Cf are CW -complexes in an obvious canonical way, see e.g. Fritsch–Piccinini [1]. In particular, the suspension SX of a CW -complex X is a CW -complex.

(b) A map f : X → Y is called a Whitehead equivalence if f∗ : π n (X, x0 ) → πn (Y, f (x0 )) is a bijection for every n ≥ 0 and every x0 ∈ X.

We say that two spaces X, Y are CW -equivalent if there is a sequence a 0 a1 ai−1 ai an−1 a0 a1 ai X = X0 −−−− X1 −−−− · · · −−−−− − Xi −−−− · · · −−−−− − Xn = Y where every ai is a Whitehead equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">Budyak 38</a>)</p>
3.43. Remark. Traditionally, CW -equivalences, as well as Whitehead equivalences, are called weak equivalences. We refrain from using this terminology in this book because these names are not quite compatible with the concept of weak homotopy (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">Budyak 38</a>)</p>
3.44. Proposition–Deﬁnition. For every topological space X, there is a Whitehead equivalence f : Y → X where Y is a CW -space. Every such CW space Y is called a CW -substitute for X.

3.45. Lemma. Let h : Y → Z be a Whitehead equivalence. (i) Let (X, A) be a CW -pair, and let f : A → Y, u : X → Z be two maps such that hf = u|A. Then there is a map g : X → Y such that g|A = f and hg  u.

Proof. (i) This is an exercise in elementary obstruction theory, see e.g. Switzer [1], 6.30. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=39" target="_blank">Budyak 39</a>)</p>
3.47. Corollary (the Whitehead Theorem). If h : Y → Z is a Whitehead equivalence of CW -spaces then h is a homotopy equivalence.

1.1. Deﬁnition. (a) A spectrum E is a sequence {En , sn }, n ∈ Z, of CW complexes En and CW -embeddings sn : SEn → En+1 (i.e., sn (SEn ) is a subcomplex of En+1 ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=42" target="_blank">Budyak 42</a>)</p>
(e) For every CW -complex X the spectrum Σ∞ X is deﬁned as follows:  pt, if n < 0, ∞ (Σ∞ X)n = S n X, if n ≥ 0, and sn : S(S n X) → S n+1 X, for n ≥ 0, are the identity maps. For example, the spectrum Σ∞ S 0 is the sphere spectrum {S n , in }, where i n : SS = n −→ S n+1 .

1.2. Deﬁnition. (a) A cell of a spectrum E is a sequence {e, Se, . . . , S k e, . . . } where e is a cell of any En such that e is not the suspension of any cell of E n−1 . If e is a cell of En of dimension d then the dimension of the cell {e, Se, . . . , S k e, . . . } of E is d − n. Furthermore, the base points of En ’s yield the cell of dimension −∞.

(b) A subspectrum F of a spectrum E is coﬁnal (in E) if every cell of E is eventually in F , i.e., for every cell e of En there exists m such that S m e belongs to Fn+m .

(g) A suspension spectrum is a spectrum of the form Σk Σ∞ X where X is a pointed space and k ∈ Z.

1.3. Deﬁnition. (a) Let E = {En , sn } and F = {Fn , tn } be two spectra. A map f from E to F (i.e., a map f : E → F ) is a family of pointed cellular maps fn : En → Fn such that fn+1 sn = tn ◦Sfn for all n.

Let S = Σ∞ S 0 be the spectrum of spheres. The group [Σk S, E] is called the k-th homotopy group of E and denoted by πk (E). It is easy to see that π k (E) = lim πk+N (EN ) where the direct limit is that of the direct system N →∞ (sN )∗ · · · → πk+N (EN ) → πk+N +1 (SEN ) −−−→ πk+N +1 (EN +1 ) → · · · , (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">Budyak 45</a>)</p>
1.9. Deﬁnition. (a) Two maps g0 , g1 : E → F of spectra are called homotopic if there exists a map G : E ∧ I + → F (called a homotopy) such that G coincides with gi on the subspectrum E ∧ {i, ∗}, i = 0, 1, of E. In this case we write g0  g1 or G : g0  g1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">Budyak 45</a>)</p>
(b) Two morphisms ϕ0 , ϕ1 : E → F of spectra are called homotopic, if there exists a coﬁnal subspectrum E  of E and two maps gi : E  → F, gi ∈ ϕ i , i = 0, 1, such that g0 |E   g1 |E  . It is straightforward to show that homotopic morphisms form equivalence classes, and in particular we can deﬁne the homotopy class [ϕ] of a morphism ϕ to be the set of all morphisms homotopic to ϕ. The set of all homotopy classes of morphisms E → F is denoted by [E, F ]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">Budyak 45</a>)</p>
Thus, we can deﬁne a category H S with spectra as objects and sets [E, F ] as sets of morphisms. Isomorphisms of H S are called equivalences (of spectra), and we use the notation E  F when E is equivalent to (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">Budyak 45</a>)</p>

In particular, if E = Σ∞ X then π k (E) is just the stable homotopy group Πk (X) (denoted also by πkst (X)) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">Budyak 46</a>)</p>
An analog of the Whitehead Theorem is valid for spectra. 1.10. Theorem. A morphism ϕ : E → F is an equivalence iﬀ the induced homomorphism ϕ∗ : πk (E) → πk (F ) is an isomorphism for every integer k. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">Budyak 46</a>)</p>
One of the important advantages of the category H S is that the suspension operator is invertible there. 1.11. Proposition. The spectra S 1 ∧ E and ΣE are equivalent. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">Budyak 46</a>)</p>
1.12. Deﬁnition. (a) A strict coﬁber sequence of spectra is a diagram ϕ ψ E− →F − → Cϕ where ϕ : E → F is a morphism of spectra (resp. map of spaces) and ψ is a canonical inclusion as in 1.7(b). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">Budyak 46</a>)</p>
1.14. Proposition. For every spectrum F the function  {i∗ λ } : [∨λ E(λ), F ] → [E(λ), F ], where {i∗λ }(f ) = {f iλ }, λ is a bijection.

f g 1.13. Lemma. (i) If X − → Y − → Z is a coﬁber sequence of spectra, then f g h there exists a map h : Z → ΣX such that X − →Y − →Z − → ΣX is a long coﬁber sequence.

Since [E, F ] = [Σ2 E, Σ2 F ] = [S 2 ∧ E, Σ2 F ] (the last equality follows from 1.11), [E, F ] admits a natural structure of an abelian group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">Budyak 48</a>)</p>
Thus, H S is an additive category. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=48" target="_blank">Budyak 48</a>)</p>
f g In view of 1.11 and 1.13(i), every coﬁber sequence X − →Y − → Z yields a long coﬁber sequence −1 . . . → Σ −1 Y Σ−1 g f g Σf −−−→ Σ−1 Z − →X − →Y − → Z → ΣX −−→ ΣY − → ··· .

The ﬁrst of the above sequences is similar to a sequence which holds for a coﬁbration X → Y with coﬁber Z , while the second one is similar to a sequence which holds for a ﬁbration X → Y with ﬁber Σ−1 Z . Thus, the diﬀerence between ﬁbrations and coﬁbrations disappears in the category H S . For this reason we call Σ −1 Cϕ the fiber of a morphism ϕ.

Hence, the element 1X ⊕ 1X of the right hand side yields a (unique up to homotopy) morphism ∇ : X → X ∨ X. We leave it to the reader to show that addition in [X, E] is given by the composition ∼ = ∇∗ ∼ = ∇∗ [X, E] ⊕ [X, E] −→ [X ∨ X, E] −−→ [X, E]. Because of this, we call ∇ coaddition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=49" target="_blank">Budyak 49</a>)</p>

1.18. Deﬁnition. A prespectrum is a family {Xn , tn }, n ∈ Z, of pointed spaces Xn and pointed maps tn : SXn → Xn+1 .

A spectrum is called an Ω-spectrum if it is an Ω-prespectrum. 1.21. Proposition (cf. Adams [5]). Every spectrum E = {En , sn } is equivalent to some Ω-spectrum.

Some authors have developed a ﬁner theory by indexing terms of a spectrum not by integers but by ﬁnite dimensional subspaces of R∞ . This approach was suggested by Puppe [2] and May [3]. Such spectra are very useful for working with some ﬁne geometry. However, the foundations of this theory are quite complicated. For our purposes, the mass of preliminaries outweighs the gain; thus we do not use these spectra here and so do not dwell on them. However, they seem to be very useful for advanced homotopy theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">Budyak 54</a>)</p>
One can introduce a smash product E ∧ F of spectra E, F as a generalization of the smash product E ∧ X of a spectrum and a space.

2.3. Deﬁnition. (a) A morphism u : S → A ∧ A⊥ is called a duality morphism, or simply a duality, between spectra A and A⊥ if for every spectrum E the homomorphisms u E : [A, E] → [S, E ∧ A ⊥ ], uE (ϕ) = (ϕ ∧ 1A⊥ )u and u E : [A⊥ , E] → [S, A ∧ E], uE (ϕ) = (1A ∧ ϕ)u are isomorphisms. (b) A spectrum A⊥ is called dual to a spectrum A if there exists a duality S → A ∧ A⊥ . By 2.1(ii), in this case A is dual to A⊥ . So, “to be dual” is a symmetric relation.

2.6. Remarks. (a) Some authors deﬁne duality to be a morphism v : A ∧ A ⊥ → S such that F vE : [E, A⊥ ∧ F ] → [A ∧ E, F ] and F v E : [E, F ∧ A] → [E ∧ A⊥ , F ] are isomorphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=58" target="_blank">Budyak 58</a>)</p>

2.12. Deﬁnition. (a) A ring spectrum is a triple (E, μ, ι) where E is a spectrum and μ : E ∧ E → E (the multiplication) and ι : S → E (the unit morphism, or the unit) are certain morphisms with the following properties: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=60" target="_blank">Budyak 60</a>)</p>
2.13. Deﬁnition. (a) A module spectrum over a ring spectrum (E, μ, ι), or an E-module spectrum, is a pair (F, m) where F is a spectrum and m : E ∧ F → F is a morphism such that the following diagrams commute up to homotopy: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=61" target="_blank">Budyak 61</a>)</p>
it was noticed that many useful constructions of algebraic topology (K-functor, (co)bordism, etc.) are formally similar to (co)homology theories. Afterwards the reason for this phenomenon was clariﬁed: namely, most of these constructions satisfy all the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms except the so-called dimension axiom. So, it seemed reasonable to consider the objects satisfying these axioms. These objects were called extraordinary (co)homology theories. However, later mathematicians came to call these objects just (co)homology theories, while H(−; G) got the name ordinary (co)homology theory. 5 Now this terminology is commonly accepted, and we use it in this book. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=62" target="_blank">Budyak 62</a>)</p>
It is easy to see that we have a category of homology theories and their morphisms. In particular, the equivalence (isomorphism) of homology theories is deﬁned in the usual way: it is a morphism of homology theories which is also a natural equivalence of functors.

The exact sequences as in 3.1(2), 3.2(iv), and 3.2(v) are known as the exact sequence of a pair, the exact sequence of a triple, and the Mayer– Vietoris exact sequence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">Budyak 65</a>)</p>
The  family {hn , sn } is called a reduced homology theory (on K ) corresponding • to {hn , ∂n }.

This proposition shows that there is a bijective correspondence between unreduced and reduced homology theories. In other words, every unreduced homology theory is completely determined by its reduced form (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=68" target="_blank">Budyak 68</a>)</p>
The groups hi (pt, ∅) =  hi (S  hi (S 0 , ∗) are called the coeﬃcient groups of the homology theory {hn , ∂n }. To justify this term, note that H∗ (pt, ∅; A) = A for every abelian group A.

It is possible and useful to introduce (co)homology theories on spectra. Consider the following full subcategories of S : Sfd : its objects are all ﬁnite dimensional spectra; Ss : its objects are all suspension spectra; Ssfd : its objects are all spectra of the form Σn Σ∞ X, n ∈ Z, X ∈ Cfd • ; Sf : its objects are all ﬁnite spectra. 3.10. Deﬁnition. Let L be one of the categories S , Sfd , Ss , Ssfd , Sf , and let Σ : L → L be the functor deﬁned in 1.1(d). (a) A homology theory on L is a family {hn , sn }, n ∈ Z of covariant functors hn : L → A G and natural transformations  sn : hn → hn+1 Σ satisfying the following axioms: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">Budyak 70</a>)</p>
3.12. Proposition. Let L be as in 3.10, and let {hn , ŝn } be a cohomology theory on L . Then: (i) hn (X ∨ Y ) ∼ = ∼ = hn (X) ⊕ hn (Y ). f g (ii) For every coﬁber sequence X − →Y − → Z of spectra there is a natural exact sequence ∗ f∗ g∗ f∗ → hn−1 (X) − ··· − → hn (Z) −→ hn (Y ) −→ hn (X) − → hn+1 (Z) − → ··· . (iii) Let A, B be two subspectra of a spectrum X. Set C = A ∩ B. Then there is a natural (Mayer-Vietoris) exact sequence ··· − → hn (X) − → hn (A) ⊕ hn (B) − → hn (C) − → hn−1 (X) − → ··· .  (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=72" target="_blank">Budyak 72</a>)</p>
3.22. Construction. Let E be an arbitrary spectrum. (a) Deﬁne covariant functors En : S → A G where En (X) := πn (E ∧ X) for every X ∈ S and En (f ) := πn (1E ∧ f ) for every morphism f : X → Y of spectra. Furthermore, deﬁne sn : En → En+1 Σ to be the composition En (X) = πn (E ∧ X) = πn+1 (Σ(E ∧ X))  πn+1 (E ∧ ΣX) = En+1 (ΣX) for every X ∈ S . By 1.15 and 2.1(vi), (En , sn ) is a homology theory on S , and, by 1.16(iii) and 2.1(v), it is additive. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Budyak 78</a>)</p>
hus, every spectrum yields a (co)homology theory on S (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Budyak 78</a>)</p>
. So, we have a functor from spectra to (co)homology theories. In particular, equivalent spectra yield isomorphic (co)homology theories. According to 3.22, one can assign a (co)homology theory to a spectrum. This situation turns out to be invertible, see Ch. III, §3 below. ∗ 3.23. Proposition. For every spectrum E, the cohomology theory E ∗ is dual to the homology theory E∗ .

.27. Proposition-Deﬁnition. Given a spectrum E, let Ω∞ E denote a  0 : representing space for E H C • → A G (i.e., Ω∞ E = F0 for some Ωspectrum F equivalent to E). This space Ω∞ E is called the inﬁnite delooping of E and has the following properties: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=80" target="_blank">Budyak 80</a>)</p>
this section we develop the homotopy theory of spectra. Namely, we discuss Postnikov towers, Cartan killing constructions, Serre theory of classes of abelian group, etc., for spectra. (We assume that the reader knows these notions in the case of spaces; otherwise he can ﬁnd them e.g. in Mosher– Tangora [1].) Closely related material is exposed in Dold [3] and Margolis [1].

4.9. Theorem (the Universal Coeﬃcient Theorem). For every spectrum E and every abelian group G, there are exact sequences 0 → Ext(Hn−1 (E), G) → H n (E; G) → Hom(Hn (E), G) → 0 and 0 → Hn (E) ⊗ G → Hn (E; G) → Tor(Hn−1 (E), G) → 0. In particular, H0 (H(A); B) ∼ = A ⊗ B, H 0 (H(A); B) ∼ = ∼ = Hom(A, B).

4.11. Theorem (the Künneth Theorem). Let k be a ﬁeld, and let E, F be a pair of spectra. (i) The homomorphism μ E,F : H∗ (E; k) ⊗ H∗ (F ; k) → H∗ (E ∧ F ; k) is an isomorphism. In particular,  H n (E ∧ F ; k) ∼ = ∼ = Hi (E; k) ⊗k Hj (F ; k). i+j=n (ii) Assume that E is bounded below and F has ﬁnite type. Then the homomorphism μ E,F : H ∗ (E; k) ⊗ H ∗ (F ; k) → H ∗ (E ∧ F ; k) is an isomorphism. In particular,  H n (E ∧ F ; k) ∼ = ∼ = H i (E; k) ⊗k H j (F ; k). i+j=n (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">Budyak 93</a>)</p>
4.12. Deﬁnition. A Postnikov tower of a spectrum E is a homotopy commutative diagram of spectra (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Budyak 94</a>)</p>

4.19. Deﬁnition. The element κn ∈ H n+1 (E(n−1) ; πn (E)) is called the n-th Postnikov invariant of E.

Now we apply the Serre class theory (see Serre [1], Mosher–Tangora [1]) to spectra. C (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">Budyak 98</a>)</p>
4.21. Deﬁnition. (a) A Serre class is a family of abelian groups C satisfying the following axiom: If 0 → A  → A → A → 0 is a short exact sequence, then A is in C iﬀ both A and A are in C. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">Budyak 98</a>)</p>
C iﬀ both A and A are in C. (b) Let H(A) denote the Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum of an abelian group A. A Serre class is called stable if it satisﬁes the following axiom: If A ∈ C, then Hi (H(A)) ∈ C for every i. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">Budyak 98</a>)</p>
4.23. Proposition. (i) The class of all ﬁnite abelian groups is a stable Serre class. (ii) The class of all ﬁnitely generated abelian groups is a stable Serre class.

(iii) Given a prime p, let C be the class of all abelian groups having pprimary exponents (i.e., for every A ∈ C there exists k such that pk A = 0). Then C is a stable Serre class. (iv) Given a prime p, the class of all ﬁnite p-primary abelian groups is a stable Serre class. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">Budyak 99</a>)</p>
4.32. Theorem-Deﬁnition. For every abelian group A, there exists a spectrum M (A) with the following properties: (i) πi (M (A)) = 0 for i < 0; (ii) π0 (M (A)) = A = H0 (M (A)); (iii) Hi (M (A)) = 0 for i = 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=104" target="_blank">Budyak 104</a>)</p>
Moreover, these properties determine M (A) uniquely up to equivalence. This spectrum M (A) is called the Moore spectrum of the abelian grou (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=104" target="_blank">Budyak 104</a>)</p>
Let Q be the ﬁeld of rational numbers. Let p be a prime, and let Z[p] be the subring of Q consisting of all irreducible fractions with denominators relatively prime to p. The Z[p]-localization of an abelian group A is the homomorphism A → A ⊗ Z[p], a → a ⊗ 1. The group A ⊗ Z[p] is simpler than A in a certain sense: for example, it has no q-torsion if (p, q) = 1. On the other hand, if we know the groups A ⊗ Z[p] for all p then we can obtain a lot of information about A; for example, if A is ﬁnitely generated then it is completely determined by the groups A ⊗ Z[p], where p runs through all primes. So, we can describe an abelian group A via descriptions of the simpler groups A ⊗ Z[p], and this trick is very eﬀective. For example, it is ∗ very convenient to describe the ring H ∗ (HZ) of cohomology operations via the rings H ∗ (HZ[p]; Z[p]). Also, localization enables us to ignore the torsions which are irrelevant to a particular problem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=106" target="_blank">Budyak 106</a>)</p>
More generally, it makes sense to consider subrings Λ of Q. In this case the localization A → A ⊗ Λ deletes the q-torsion with q ∈ S, where S is the set of denominators of all irreducible fractions of Λ. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=106" target="_blank">Budyak 106</a>)</p>
It is remarkable that the localization can be transferred from algebra to topology, and, in particular, one can consider the Z[p]-homotopy type of a space and a spectrum (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=106" target="_blank">Budyak 106</a>)</p>
Let Λ be a subring of Q ; its additive group is also denoted by Λ. Let π be an abelian group. π 5.1. Deﬁnition. The homomorphism l = lΛ : π → π ⊗ Λ, a → a ⊗ 1 is called the Λ-localization of π. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=106" target="_blank">Budyak 106</a>)</p>
f g 5.3. Proposition. If E − → F − → G is a coﬁber sequence of spectra then E fΛ gΛ Λ −→ FΛ −→ GΛ is. In particular, C(fΛ ) = (Cf )Λ for every morphism f : E → F of spectra.

5.5. Corollary. There are natural isomorphisms π i (EΛ ) ∼ = πi (E) ⊗ Λ, Hi (EΛ ) ∼ = Hi (E) ⊗ Λ j∗ such that the homomorphisms πi (E) −→ πi (EΛ ) ∼ πi (E) = ⊗ Λ, Hi (E) −j→ ∗ H i (EΛ ) ∼ = ∼ = Hi (E)⊗Λ have the form x → x⊗1. So, j Λ-localizes homotopy and homology groups. In particular, every Λ-local spectrum has Λ-local homotopy and homology groups.

5.7. Lemma. Let E be an arbitrary spectrum, and let Cj be the cone of the localization j : E → EΛ . Then H ∗ (Cj; π) = 0 for every Λ-local group π.

This proposition enables us to construct localizations via Postnikov towers. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=112" target="_blank">Budyak 112</a>)</p>
This approach enables us to construct the localization of spaces also. The main results of this theory are Theorems 5.12 and 5.13 below (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=112" target="_blank">Budyak 112</a>)</p>
5.12. Theorem–Deﬁnition. For every simple space X there exist a simple space XΛ and a map j = jΛX : X → XΛ such that the homomorphisms π i (X) −→ πi (XΛ ) ∼ = j∗ ∼ = π i (X) ⊗ Λ and Hi (X) −→ Hi (XΛ ) j∗ ∼ = Hi (X) ⊗ Λ have the form x → x ⊗ 1. So, j localizes homotopy and homology groups. Every such a map j is called localization of X.

As in 5.2, a simple space X is called Λ-local if j : X → XΛ is a homotopy equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=112" target="_blank">Budyak 112</a>)</p>
5.13. Theorem–Deﬁnition. For every two simple spaces X, Y the following conditions are equivalent: (i) The map f : X → Y Λ-localizes homotopy groups; (ii) The map f : X → Y Λ-localizes homology groups; (iii) For every Λ-local space Z the map f ∗ : [Y, Z] → [X, Z] is a bijection. If some (and hence all) of these conditions hold then there exists a homotopy equivalence h : XΛ → Y with f = hjΛX . Furthermore, in this case we say that f localizes X.

A homomorphism h : M → N of A-modules is an R-homomorphism such that the third diagram commutes.

6.4. Deﬁnition. An augmented R-algebra is a quadruple (A, μ, η, ε), where (A, μ, η) is an R-algebra and ε : A → R is a homomorphism of R-algebras (called the augmentation). An augmented algebra (A, μ, η, ε) is called connected if Ai = 0 for i < 0 and ε|A0 : A0 → R is an isomorphism.

6.5. Deﬁnition. Let A be a connected R-algebra, and let Ā be the Rsubmodule consisting of all elements of positive degrees. The ideal ĀĀ is denoted by Dec A, and its elements are called decomposable elements of A. Given an A-module M , let GM denote the factor module M/ĀM . Furthermore, GĀ := Ā/ Dec A usually is denoted by QA and is called (not very aptly) the set of indecomposable elements of A.

6.7. Deﬁnition. (a) A coalgebra over R is a triple (C, Δ, ε), where C is an R-module and Δ : C → C ⊗ C, ε : C → R are R-homomorphisms such that the diagrams Δ C −−−−→ C ⊗C C C C ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ Δ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ Δ⊗1 ∼ = ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐∼ Δ = 1⊗Δ ε⊗1 1⊗ε C ⊗ C −−−−→ C ⊗ C ⊗ C R ⊗ C ←−−−− C ⊗ C −−−−→ C ⊗ R commute.

The duality between algebras and coalgebras is exhibited not only in the deﬁning diagrams. For instance, let R be a ﬁeld k. Given a k-vector space C, ∗ consider the dual vector space C ∗ = Homk (C, k). If C is a k-algebra (C, μ, η) ∗ obtains a natural k-coalgebra structure (C ∗ then C ∗ obtains a natural k-coalgebra structure (C ∗ , Δ, ε) provided that every component Cn of C is a ﬁnite dimensional k-vector space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=118" target="_blank">Budyak 118</a>)</p>
Namely, Δ(f )(a ⊗ b) = f (ab), ε = η ∗ : C ∗ → k ∗ = k. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=118" target="_blank">Budyak 118</a>)</p>
6.8. Lemma. For every C-comodule (V, ψ), the function t : HomC (V, C ⊗ M ) → HomR (V, M ), t(f ) = (ε ⊗ 1)f, is bijective. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=118" target="_blank">Budyak 118</a>)</p>
6.9. Deﬁnition. A coalgebra (C, Δ, ε) is called connected if Ci = 0 for i < 0 and ε|C0 : C0 → R is an isomorphism. In this case the element v = ε−1 (1) is called the counit of C. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=119" target="_blank">Budyak 119</a>)</p>
6.11. Examples. (a) Let p be a prime, and let (E, μ, ι) be a ring spectrum of ﬁnite Z[p]-type. Then H ∗ (E; Z/p) has the natural structure of a Z/pcoalgebra.

(b) If the ring spectrum (E, μ, ι) in (a) is commutative then H ∗ (E; Z/p) is a cocommutative coalgebra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=119" target="_blank">Budyak 119</a>)</p>
(c) If E is a spectrum as in (a) and F is any E-module spectrum of ﬁnite Z[p]-type, then H ∗ (F ; Z/p) admits a structure of a comodule over H ∗ (E; Z/p). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=119" target="_blank">Budyak 119</a>)</p>
(e) For every CW -space X and every ﬁeld k we have a coalgebra H∗ (X; k) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=120" target="_blank">Budyak 120</a>)</p>
∗ (f) Dually to (e), H ∗ (X; k) is a k-algebra for every ﬁeld k and CW -space X of ﬁnite type.

6.12. Deﬁnition. Let (C, Δ, ε) be a connected coalgebra with counit v. (a) An element m ∈ C is called primitive if Δ(m) = m ⊗ v + v ⊗ m. The set (in fact, R-submodule) of all primitive elements of C is denoted by Pr C. (b) Let (V, ψ) be a C-comodule. An element m ∈ V is called simple if ψ(m) = v ⊗ m. The R-submodule of simple elements of V is denoted by Si V .

6.13. Remarks. (a) Under the duality between algebras and coalgebras over a ﬁeld, Pr C is dual to QC ∗ . (b) Sometimes simple elements are also called primitive, but we do not like this because of the danger of confusion: Pr C = Si C where C is regarded as a coalgebra on the left and as comodule on the right.

6.18. Deﬁnition. Let M be a free R-module. Given a coalgebra (C, Δ, ε), deﬁne its cofree M -extension to be the C-comodule (V, ψ) where V = C ⊗ M and ψ(c ⊗ x) = Δ(c) ⊗ x, c ∈ C, x ∈ M . A C-comodule V is called cofree if there is M such that V is isomorphic to the cofree M -extension of C.

Note that if A is a Hopf algebra over a ﬁeld k and if dimk An < ∞ for every n then A∗ = Hom(A, k) is a Hopf algebra also (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=122" target="_blank">Budyak 122</a>)</p>
6.24. Deﬁnition. Let A be a Hopf algebra over R. (a) An A-module algebra is a quadruple (M, μ, η, ϕ), where (M, μ, η) is an R-algebra and (M, ϕ) is an A-module such that μ : M ⊗ M → M is a homomorphism of A-modules and ϕ : A ⊗ M → M is a homomorphism of R-algebras. A homomorphism of A-module algebras is a homomorphism of A-modules which is at the same time a homomorphism of R-algebras. (b) An A-comodule algebra is a quadruple (M, μ, η, ψ), where (M, μ, η) is an R-algebra and (M, ψ) is an A-comodule such that μ : M ⊗ M → M is a homomorphism of A-comodules and ψ : M → A ⊗ M is a homomorphism of R-algebras. (c) An A-module coalgebra is a quadruple (V, Δ, ε, ϕ), where (V, Δ, ε) is an R-coalgebra and (V, ϕ) is an A-module such that Δ : V → V ⊗ V is a homomorphism of A-modules and ϕ : A ⊗ V → V is a homomorphism of R-coalgebras.

6.25. Recollection. A very important example of a Hopf algebra over the ﬁeld Z/p, p prime, is the Steenrod algebra  Ap = H ∗ (HZ/p; Z/p) = [HZ/p, Σd HZ/p].

All that we need to know about Ap can be found in Steenrod–Epstein [1], Margolis [1]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=124" target="_blank">Budyak 124</a>)</p>

The Steenrod algebra Ap , p > 2, is generated by elements β (the Bockstein homomorphism) and P i , dim β = 1, dim P i = 2i(p − 1), i = 1, 2, . . .

Note that the Hopf algebra Ap∗ can be described as H∗ (H), where H = HZ/p. T (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=125" target="_blank">Budyak 125</a>)</p>
27. Examples. (a) For every H-space X and every ﬁeld k, we have a Hopf algebra H∗ (X; k): t (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=125" target="_blank">Budyak 125</a>)</p>
Similarly, H ∗ (X; k) is a Hopf algebra for every H-space X of ﬁnite ∗ type, and H∗ (X; k) is the Hopf algebra dual to H ∗ (X; k).

Furthermore, if E is a ring spectrum of ﬁnite Zor Z[p]-type then H ∗ (E) is a coalgebra over the Hopf algebra Ap , (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=126" target="_blank">Budyak 126</a>)</p>

6.29. Theorem. Let A be a connected Hopf algebra over a ﬁeld k, let C be a connected module coalgebra over A, and let v be the counit of C. Let p : C → GC be the canonical epimorphism (see 6.5), and let λ : GC → C be a k-homomorphism with pλ = 1GC . Let Bm be the subspace of A ⊗ GC generated by all elements a⊗x with |a| ≤ m. If the map ν : A → C, ν(a) = av, is monic for |a| ≤ m then the A-homomorphism η : A ⊗ GC → C, η(a ⊗ x) = a(λx) is monic on Bm . Furthermore, η is epic and thus is an isomorphism in dimensions ≤ m. Proof. This theorem is a version of the Milnor–Moore Theorem, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=126" target="_blank">Budyak 126</a>)</p>
6.30. Corollary (The Milnor–Moore Theorem). Let A and C be as in 6.29. If ν : A → C, ν(a) = av, is monic then there is an isomorphism of A-modules C∼ = A ⊗ GC. In particular, C is a free A-module (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">Budyak 127</a>)</p>
a canonical antiautomorphism c : A → A (called also an antipode) as follows (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">Budyak 128</a>)</p>
6.35. Deﬁnition. Given a connected Hopf algebra (A, μ, η, Δ, ε), we deﬁne a canonical antiautomorphism c : A → (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">Budyak 128</a>)</p>
Milnor–Moore [1]. The ﬁrst example of such an antiautomorphism was found by Thom [1]; this was the canonical antiautomorphism χ : Ap → Ap of the Steenrod algebra Ap .

Hopf [1] found that ordinary (co)homology rings of Lie groups (in fact, H-spaces) had certain speciﬁc algebraic properties. (For example, the rational cohomology ring of a Lie group is a free commutative algebra.) Afterwards Borel [1] clariﬁed the situation: every algebra A (over a ﬁeld) admitting a diagonal Δ : A → A ⊗ A, Δ(ab) = Δ(a)Δ(b), has such properties. Borel suggested the name “Hopf algebra” for such object; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=129" target="_blank">Budyak 129</a>)</p>
Milnor [2] discovered that the Steenrod algebra is a Hopf algebra. In this way he got a new description of Ap , and this enabled him (and some others) to compute initial terms of certain Adams spectral sequences.

Every graded abelian group G can be realized as the total homotopy group π∗ (H(G)) of the graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum H(G), but not every spectrum E is (equivalent to) the graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum H(π∗ (E)).

. (For example, the sphere spectrum S is not, because otherwise H∗ (HZ) would be a direct summand of H∗ (S).) It is clear that it is useful to know whether a spectrum is a graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum.

For example, Thom [2] proved that the spectrum M O of the non-oriented (co)bordism is a graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectrum, and this enabled him to compute the group π∗ (M O) (i.e., non-oriented cobordism group) and to prove the realizability of all Z/2-homology classes by singular manifold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">Budyak 130</a>)</p>

7.13. Theorem-Deﬁnition (cf. Dold [1]). For every ring spectrum E there exists a ring equivalence E[0] → H(π∗ (E) ⊗ Q).

7.28. Corollary. If a commutative ring spectrum E is a graded Eilenberg– Mac Lane spectrum with pπ∗ (E) = 0, then there is an isomorphism H∗ (E) ∼ = A p∗ ⊗ π∗ (E) of Ap -comodule algebras.

7.30. Theorem (Boardman [1]). Let E, F be two commutative ring spectra. Suppose that E, F are graded Eilenberg–Mac Lane spectra with pπ∗ (E) = 0 = pπ∗ (F ). Then every ring homomorphism r : π∗ (E) → π∗ (F ) is induced by a ring morphism f : E → F . So, if there exists a ring isomorphism π ∗ (E) ∼ = ∼ = π∗ (F ) then there exists a ring equivalence E  F . In particular, there is a ring equivalence E  H(π∗ (E)).

A phantom, or a phantom map, is an essential map f : X → Y of a CW complex X such that f |X (n) is inessential for every n (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=143" target="_blank">Budyak 143</a>)</p>
1.1. Deﬁnition. A map f : X → Y of spaces (or a morphism of spectra) is called an X -phantom if σ[f ] = ∗ while [f ] = ∗. Similarly, an element a ∈ E ∗ (X) is an X -phantom if σ(a) = 0 while a = 0.

1.5. Example of a weak phantom. Let X = S n [1/3] be a Z[1/3]-localized sphere S n , n > 1, i.e., the telescope of a sequence f f f f Sn − → Sn − → ··· − → Sn − → ··· , where f : S n → S n is a map of degree 3. If we regard S n as a CW -complex with two cells, we obtain a cellular decomposition of X with 0-, nand (n+1)dimensional cells. This gives us a chain complex {C∗ (X), ∂∗ }, where Cn (X) has Z-basis {a1 , . . . , ai , . . . }, and Cn+1 (X) has Z-basis {b1 , . . . , bn , . . . }, and ∂ n+1 bi = ai − 3ai+1 . Let X = {Xλ } be the family of all ﬁnite CW n+1 subcomplexes of X. It is clear that HX (X) = H n+1 (S n ) = 0. On the other hand, H n+1 (X) = 0 because the cocycle ϕ : Cn+1 (X) → Z, ϕ(bi ) = 1 for every i, is not a coboundary. Indeed, if ϕ = δψ for some ψ : Cn (X) → Z, then ψ(ai ) − 3ψ(ai+1 ) = 1. In particular, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Budyak/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobordism (694)/On Thom Spectra, Orientability, and Cobord - Budyak.pdf#page=144" target="_blank">Budyak 144</a>)</p>
ψ(a 1 ) = + 3k ψ(ak+1 ) 2 for every k. Hence, 3k divides 2ψ(a1 ) + 1 for every k, and so 2ψ(a1 ) = −1. This is a contradiction. Thus, the subgroup of weak phantoms of H n+1 (X) is nontrivial (and even uncountable, see 5.1 below).

Consider the space T = S 3 [0], the telescope of the sequence S 13 ϕ1 ϕ2 ϕn −→ S23 −→ · · · − → Sn3 −−→ Sn+1 3 − → ··· , where Sn3 is a copy of S 3 and deg ϕn = n.

Deﬁnition 1.4. A cellular map f : X → Y is a continuous function between CW-complexes so that f (Xq ) ⊂ Yq for all q. A cellular map induces a chain map f∗ : C∗ (X; R) → C∗ (Y ; R), since f restricts to a map of pairs f : (Xq , Xq−1 ) → (Yq , Yq−1 ). Thus for every q, cellular homology is a functor (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 20</a>)</p>
So for example, the circle S 1 has a cell structure with one 0-cell and one 1-cell. The boundary map is trivial, so H1 (S 1 ) ∼ = ∼ = Z. A generator [S 1 ] ∈ H1 (S ) is speciﬁed by taking the 1-cell which parameterizes the circle 1 in a counterclockwise fashion. We can use this to deﬁne the Hurewicz map ρ : π1 (X, x0 ) → H1 (X; Z) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 20</a>)</p>
Theorem 1.6. Suppose that X is path–connected. Then the Hurewicz map ρ : π1 (X, x0 ) → H1 (X; Z) is a surjection with kernel the commutator subgroup of π1 (X, x0 ). Hence H1 (X; Z) is isomorphic to the abelianization of π1 (X, x0 ).

1.1.4. Construction of the simplicial chain complex of a simplicial complex. Deﬁnition 1.7. An (abstract) simplicial complex K is a pair (V, S) where V is a set and S is a collection of non-empty ﬁnite subsets of V satisfying: 1. If v ∈ V then {v} ∈ S. 2. If τ ⊂ σ ∈ S and τ is non-empty, then τ ∈ S. Elements of V are called vertices. Elements of S are called simplices. A q-simplex is an element of S with q + 1 vertices. If σ ∈ S is a q-simplex we say dim (σ) = q.

Deﬁnition 1.8. The geometric realization of a simplicial complex K is the quotient space |K| =  σ∈S ∆ dim (σ) ∼ .

Deﬁnition 1.9. The tensor product of A and B is the R-module A ⊗R B deﬁned as the quotient F (A × B) R(A × B) where F (A × B) is the free R-module with basis A × B and R(A × B) the submodule generated by 1. (a1 + a2 , b) − (a1 , b) − (a2 , b) 2. (a, b1 + b2 ) − (a, b1 ) − (a, b1 ) 3. r(a, b) − (ra, b) 4. r(a, b) − (a, rb).

One denotes the image of a basis element (a, b) in A ⊗R B by a ⊗ b. Note that one has the relations 1. (a1 + a2 ) ⊗ b = a1 ⊗ b + a2 ⊗ b, 2. a ⊗ (b1 + b2 ) = a ⊗ b1 + a ⊗ b2 , 3. (ra ⊗ b) = r(a ⊗ b) = (a ⊗ rb).

Any element of A ⊗ B can be expressed as a ﬁnite sum uct  ai ⊗ bi , but it may not be possible to take n = 1, nor is the representation as a sum unique.

The universal property of the tensor product is that this map is initial in the category of bilinear maps with domain A × B.

Proposition 1.10. Given a R-bilinear map φ : A×B → M , there is unique R-module map φ̄ φ̄ : A ⊗R B → M so that φ̄ ◦ π = φ.

Proposition 1.10 is useful for deﬁning maps out of tensor products, and the following exercise indicates that this is the deﬁning property of tensor products. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 24</a>)</p>
. The basic properties of the tensor product are given by the next theorem. Theorem 1.11. 1. A ⊗ B ∼ = ∼ =B⊗A 2. R ⊗ B ∼ = ∼ =B 3. (A ⊗ B) ⊗ C ∼ = ∼ = A ⊗ (B ⊗ C) 4. (⊕α Aα ) ⊗ B ∼ = ∼ = ⊕ α (Aα ⊗ B) 5. Given R-module maps f : A → C and g : B → D, there is an Rmodule map f ⊗ g : A ⊗ B → C ⊗ D so that a ⊗ b → f (a) ⊗ g(b). 6. The functor − ⊗ M is right exact. That is, given an R-module M , and an exact sequence A f f − →B g g − → C → 0, the sequence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 24</a>)</p>
the sequence A ⊗ M f ⊗Id f ⊗Id −−−→ B ⊗ M g⊗Id g⊗Id −−−→ C ⊗ M → 0 is exact.

Example 1.12. Let M be an abelian group. Applying properties 5 and 2 of Theorem 1.11 we see that if we tensor the short exact sequence 0 → Z ×n ×n −−→ Z → Z/n → 0 by M we obtain the exact sequence M ×n ×n −−→ M → Z/n ⊗Z M → 0. Notice that Z/n ⊗Z M ∼ = ∼ = M/nM and that the sequence is not short exact if M has torsion whose order is not relatively prime to n. Thus − ⊗ M is not left exact.

1.2.2. Adjoint functors. Note that a R-bilinear map β : A × B → C is the same as an element of HomR (A, HomR (B, C)) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 25</a>)</p>
Proposition 1.14 (Adjoint Property of Tensor Products). There is an isomorphism of R-modules HomR (A ⊗R B, C) ∼ = ∼ = HomR (A, HomR (B, C)), natural in A, B, C given by φ ↔ (a → (b → φ(a ⊗ b))).

This is more elegant than the universal property for three reasons: It is a statement in terms of the category of R-modules, it gives a reason for the duality between tensor product and Hom, and it leads us to the notion of adjoint functor. Deﬁnition 1.15. (Covariant) functors F : C → D and G : D → C form an adjoint pair if there is a 1-1 correspondence MorD (F c, d) ←→ MorC (c, Gd), for all c ∈ Ob C and d ∈ Ob D, natural in c and d. The functor F is said to be the left adjoint of G and G is the right adjoint of F . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 26</a>)</p>
The adjoint property says that for any R-module B, the functors − ⊗ R B : R-MOD → R-MOD and HomR (B, −) : R-MOD → R-MOD form an adjoint pair. Here R-MOD is the category whose objects are Rmodules and whose morphisms are R-maps. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 26</a>)</p>
random functor may not have a left (or right) adjoint, but if it does, the adjoint is unique up to natural isomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 26</a>)</p>
Hence taking duals deﬁnes a contravariant functor from the category of R-modules to itself.

The following computational facts may help with Exercise 8. 1. HomR (R, M ) ∼ = ∼ = M. 2. HomR (⊕α Aα , M ) ∼ = ∼ = α HomR (Aα , M ). 3. HomR (A, α Mα ) ∼ = ∼ = α HomR (A, Mα ).

The starting observation is that the singular (or cellular) homology functor is a composite of two functors, the singular complex functor S∗ : { spaces, cts. maps } → { chain complexes, chain maps } and the homology functor H∗ :{chain complexes, chain maps}→{graded R-modules, homomorphisms}. The strategy is to place interesting algebraic constructions between S∗ and H∗ ; i.e. to use functors {Chain Complexes} → {Chain Complexes} to construct new homology invariants of spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=27" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 27</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 1.16. Taking the homology of C∗ ⊗ M yields the homology of C∗ with coeﬃcients in M : H∗ (C∗ ; M ) = ker ∂ : C∗ ⊗ M → C∗ ⊗ M Im ∂ : C∗ ⊗ M → C∗ ⊗ M . Applying this to the singular complex of a space leads to the following deﬁnition. Deﬁnition 1.17. The homology of S∗ (X; R) ⊗ M is called the singular homology of X with coeﬃcients in the R-module M and is denoted by H∗ (X; M ).

Recall that for a chain complex (C∗ , ∂), a cycle is an element of ker ∂ and a boundary is an element of Im ∂. The terminology for cochain complexes is obtained by using the “co” preﬁx: Deﬁnition 1.20. A cocycle is an element in the kernel of δ and a coboundary is an element in the image of δ.

The Kronecker pairing on the homology and cohomology of a space should be thought of as an analogue (in fact it is a generalization) of integrating a diﬀerential n-form along an n-dimensional submanifold.

The map H n (C∗ ; R) → HomR (Hn (C∗ ; R), R) need not be injective nor surjective.

Suppose X is a smooth manifold. Let Ω q (X) be the vector space of diﬀerential q-forms on a manifold. Let d : Ω q (X) → Ωq+1 (X) be the exterior derivative. Then (Ω ∗ (X), d) is an R-cochain complex, whose cohomology is denoted by H ∗ DR (Ω ∗ (X), d) and is called the DeRham cohomology of X. This gives geometric analogues: q-form and q-cochain, d and δ, closed form and cocycle, exact form and coboundary. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 31</a>)</p>
DeRham’s theorem states that the DeRham cohomology of a manifold X is isomorphic to the singular cohomology H ∗ (X; R). More precisely, let Sqsmooth qsm (X; R) be the free R-module generated by smooth singular simplices σ : ∆ q → X. There is the chain map S ∗smooth (X; R) → S∗ (X; R) given by inclusion and the cochain map Ω (X) → S∗smooth (X; R) given by integrating a q-form along a q-chain. DeRham’s theorem follows from the fact that both maps are chain homotopy equivalences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 31</a>)</p>
1.4.1. Relative cohomology. Recall that the relative singular chain complex of a pair (X, A) is deﬁned by taking the chain groups Sq (X, A) = Sq (X)/Sq (A).

Čech cohomology theory is another theory that satisﬁes the axioms (at least for the subcategory of pairs of compact spaces), but the Č Čech cohomology of the topologist’s sine curve is not isomorphic to the singular cohomology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=35" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 35</a>)</p>

cohomology. Thus the axioms do not determine the cohomology of space. However they do for ﬁnite CW-complexes. An informal way of saying this is that the proof that cellular cohomology equals singular cohomology uses only the axioms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=35" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 35</a>)</p>

Let H ∗ and ̂ Ĥ ∗ be contravariant functors from the category {pairs of ﬁnite CW-complexes, cellular maps} to {graded R-modules, homomorphisms} satisfying the Eilenberg-Steenrod Axioms. Let pt be a point. 1. If H 0 (pt) ∼ = ∼ = ̂ Ĥ 0 (pt), then there is a natural isomorphism of functors H ∗ → Ĥ ∗ . 2. Any natural transformation H ∗ → Ĥ ∗ inducing an isomorphism for a point, is an isomorphism for all CW-complexes.

There are also many functors from spaces to R-modules for which the dimension axiom of Eilenberg and Steenrod does not hold. These are called generalized (co)homology theories.

1.6.1. Cellular approximation theorem. Recall that a cellular map f : X → Y is a map between CW-complexes which satisﬁes f (X n ) ⊂ Y n for all n. The cellular approximation theorem says that any map between CWcomplexes is homotopic to a cellular map (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=36" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 36</a>)</p>
We have already seen that the functors − ⊗R M , HomR (M, −), and HomR (−, M ) are not exact in general. For example taking R = Z, M = Z/2, and the short exact sequence 0 → Z ×2 ×2 −→ Z → Z/2 → 0, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 38</a>)</p>
Exercise 20. If F is a free module, show that − ⊗R F and HomR (F, −) are exact functors. Show by example that HomR (−, F ) need not be exact. The idea of homological algebra is to ﬁnd natural functors which measure the failure of a functor to preserve short exact sequences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=39" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 39</a>)</p>
(A ﬁrst stab at this for − ⊗R M might be to take the kernel of A ⊗ M → B ⊗ M as the value of this functor. Unfortunately, this does not behave nicely with respect to morphisms.)

Before we embark on the proof of this theorem, we prove that these axioms characterize the functors Tor and Ext. Theorem 2.3 (Uniqueness). Any two functors satisfying T1), T2), and T3) are naturally isomorphic. Any two functors satisfying E1), E2), and E3) are naturally isomorphic.

The technique of the above proof is called dimension shifting, and it can be useful for computations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=41" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 41</a>)</p>
Proposition 2.4. Let R be a commutative ring and a ∈ R a non-zerodivisor (i.e. ab = 0 implies b = 0). Let M be an R-module. Let M/a = M/aM and a M = {m ∈ M |am = 0}. Then 1. R/a ⊗ M ∼ = ∼ M/a, = 2. Tor1 (R/a, M ) ∼ = ∼ = aM , 3. Hom(R/a, M ) ∼ = ∼ = aM , 4. Ext 1 (R/a, M ) ∼ = ∼ = M/a.

Proposition 2.5. 1. If R is a ﬁeld, then Tor n R n (−, −) and ExtR n (−, −) are zero for n > 0. 2. If R is a P.I.D., then Tor n R n (−, −) and ExtR n (−, −) are zero for n > 1. Proof.

Corollary 2.7. The functors Tor R n (A, B) and Tor R n (B, A) are naturally isomorphic.

Tor and Ext are higher derived versions of ⊗R and Hom, so they have analogous properties. For example we oﬀer without proof: 1. Tor n R n (⊕α Aα , B) ∼ = ∼ = ⊕ α Tor n R n (Aα , B), 2. Extn R (⊕α Aα , B) ∼ = ∼ = α Extn R R (Aα , B), and 3. Ext n R (A, α Bα ) ∼ = ∼ = α Ext n R (A, Bα ).

Much of what we say can be done in the more general setting of abelian categories, these are categories where the concept of exact sequence makes sense (for example the category of sheaves or the category of representations of a Lie algebra) provided there are “enough projectives” or “enough injectives” in the category. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=43" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 43</a>)</p>
Recall, if F is a free module over R, A, B are R-modules, and F A ✲ B ✲ 0 α ❄ β ✲ α ✲ is a diagram with α onto, then there exists a γ : F → A so that F A ✲ B ✲ 0 α ❄ β ✠ γ ✲ α ✲ commutes. We say “the problem F A α✲ B ✲ 0 ❄ β p p p p p p✠p γ ✲ ✲ has a solution (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 44</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 2.8. An R-module P is called projective if for any A, B, α, β with α onto, the problem P A α✲ B ✲ 0 ❄ β p p p p p ✠ p✠p γ ✲ ✲ has a solution γ. Lemma 2.9. An R-module P is projective if and only if there exists an R-module Q so that P ⊕ Q is a free R-module (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 44</a>)</p>
Thus projective modules generalize free modules by isolating one of the main properties of free modules. Furthermore the deﬁnition of a projective module is purely in terms of arrows in R-MOD, and hence is more elegant than the deﬁnition of a free module. On the other hand they are less familiar. Exercise 22. Let P be a projective module. 1. Any short exact sequence 0 → A → B → P → 0 is split. 2. If P is ﬁnitely generated there is a ﬁnitely generated Q so that P ⊕ Q is free. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 45</a>)</p>
Proposition 2.10. 1. Any module over a ﬁeld is projective. 2. Any projective module over a P.I.D. is free (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=45" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 45</a>)</p>
Proof. All modules over a ﬁeld are free, hence projective. A projective module P is a submodule of the free module P ⊕ Q, and for P.I.D.’s submodules of free modules are free. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 46</a>)</p>
Note that R must be complicated, i.e. not a ﬁeld nor a P.I.D. For example, if R = Z/6, then P = Z/2 is a projective module. (To see this, use the Chinese remainder theorem Z/6 = Z/2 × Z/3). Here is a more interesting example, related to K-theory. Let R be the ring of continuous functions on the circle, R = C 0 (S 1 , R). Let E → S 1 be the twisted real line bundle over S 1 (so E = open Möbius band) Then as vector bundles E  = ∼ = S ∼ 1 × R, but E ⊕ E ∼ = ∼ = S 1 × R2 . So, if M = C 0 (E) (continuous sections of E), M is not free (why?), but M ⊕ M ∼ = ∼ = C 0 (S 1 , R) ⊕ C 0 (S 1 , R) = R ⊕ R. Thus M is projective. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 46</a>)</p>
One of the quantities measured by the functor K0 of algebraic K-theory is the diﬀerence between projective and free modules over a ring. See Chapter 11 for another aspect of algebraic K-theory, namely the geometric meaning of the functor K1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 46</a>)</p>
Corollary 2.11. For a projective module P , for n > 0, and for any module M , both Tor R n (P, M ) and Ext n R (P, M ) vanish.

Deﬁnition 2.12. An R-module M is called injective if M A ✛β B ✛ 0 pp p pp p p p p pp ✒ p pp ✒ ✛ ✻ α ✛ has a solution for all A, B, α, β (with β injective) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=47" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 47</a>)</p>
Theorem 2.13. An abelian group A is injective if and only if is divisible, (i.e. the equation nx = a has a solution x ∈ A for each n ∈ Z, a ∈ A.)

Thus some examples of injective abelian groups are Q and Q/Z. (Note that a quotient of a divisible group is divisible, hence injective.)

Comment about Commutative Algebra. A Dedekind Domain is a commutative domain (no zero divisors) in which every module has a projective resolution of length 1. Equivalently submodules of projective modules are projective. A P.I.D. is a Dedekind domain (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=49" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 49</a>)</p>
submodules of projective modules are projective. A P.I.D. is a Dedekind domain. From the point of view of category theory, they are perhaps more natural than P.I.D.’s (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=49" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 49</a>)</p>
If ζn = e 2πi/n is a primitive n-th root of unity, then Z[ζn ] is a Dedekind domain. Projective modules (in fact ideals) which are not free ﬁrst arise at n = 23. Non-free ideals are what makes Fermat’s Last Theorem so hard to prove (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=49" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 49</a>)</p>
A commutative Noetherian ring R has height equal to n (ht(R) = n) if the longest chain of non-trivial prime ideals in R has length n: 0 ⊂ P1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Pn ⊂ R.

The homological dimension of R, hdim(R), is the least upper bound on the length of projective resolutions for all ﬁnitely generated modules over R. The homological dimension of a ﬁeld is 0 and a Dedekind domain is 1. If a ring has homological dimension n, then any module M has a projective resolution with Pk = 0 for k > n. The numbers ht(R) and hdim(R) are related. For a large class of rings (regular rings) they are equal.

free module is ﬂat and clearly a summand of a ﬂat module is ﬂat, so projectives are ﬂat. There are modules which are ﬂat, but not projective; show that Q is a ﬂat but not projective Z-module.

Deﬁnition 2.21. A projective chain complex P∗ = {· · · → P2 → P1 → P0 } is a chain complex where all the modules Pi are projective.

Theorem 2.22 (Fundamental lemma of homological algebra.). Let P∗ be a projective chain complex and C∗ be an acyclic chain complex over a ring R.

Theorem 2.29 (universal coeﬃcient theorem for cohomology). Let R be a principal ideal domain.

Applying the universal coeﬃcient theorem to the singular or cellular complexes of a space or a pair of spaces one obtains the following. Corollary 2.32. If (X, A) is a pair of spaces A ⊂ X, R a P.I.D., M a module over R, then for each q the sequence 0 → ExtR (Hq−1 (X, A; R), M ) → H q (X, A; M ) → Hom(Hq (X, A; R),M ) → 0 is short exact, natural, and splits (though the splitting is not natural).

Corollary 2.31. If R is a ﬁeld, M is a vector space over R, and C∗ is a chain complex over R, then H q (C∗ ; M ) ∼ ∼ = Hom(Hq (C∗ ), M ).

Then for space X whose homology is ﬁnitely generated in every dimension (e.g. a ﬁnite CW -complex), the universal coeﬃcient theorem shows that H q (X) ∼ = ∼ = free(Hq (X)) ⊕ torsion(Hq−1 (X)).

∗ = Hom(A, Z) and the torsion dual A  ∼ = ∼ = Hom(A, Q/Z), then the universal coeﬃcient theorem says that H q (X) ∼ = ∼ = Hq (X) ∗ ⊕ (torsion(Hq−1 (X))). The right hand side is then a contravariant functor in X but the isomorphism is still not natural.

Theorem 2.33.

(<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 70</a>)</p>
The confusing, abstract, but important point is that A and B are not canonical, but only natural. That is, they are obtained by the method of acyclic models, and so constructed step by step by making certain arbitrary choices. However, these choices are made consistently for all spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 70</a>)</p>
It is harder to imagine a candidate for the reverse map A : S∗ (X × Y ) → S∗ (X) ⊗ S∗ (Y ), but one can do this explicitly using projections to X and Y – the “Alexander-Whitney diagonal approximation”. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 70</a>)</p>
However, even if one constructs the maps A and B explicitly, they will only be chain homotopy equivalences, not isomorphisms; S∗ (X × Y ) is simply bigger than S∗ (X) ⊗ S∗ (Y ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 70</a>)</p>
3.3.1. The homology cross product and the Künneth formula. Exercise 32 implies that the natural map × alg : Hp X ⊗ Hq Y → Hp+q (S∗ X ⊗ S∗ Y ) given on the chain level by [a] ⊗ [b] → [a ⊗ b] is well-deﬁned. Denote by B∗ the isomorphism induced by the Eilenberg-Zilber map on homology, so B∗ : H∗ (S∗ (X) ⊗ S∗ (Y )) → H∗ (S∗ (X × Y )) = H∗ (X × Y ). Composing ×alg with B∗ , we obtain × : Hp X ⊗ Hq Y → Hp+q (X × Y ). Deﬁnition 3.5. If α ∈ Hp X, β ∈ Hq Y , the image of α ⊗ β under this map is called the homology cross product of α and β, and is denoted by α × β. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 71</a>)</p>
The Eilenberg-Zilber theorem has the following important consequence. Theorem 3.6 (Künneth formula). If R is a P.I.D., there exists a split exact sequence 0 → n ⊕ p=0 Hp X ⊗ Hn−p Y → Hn (X × Y ) → n−1 ⊕ p=0 Tor(Hp X, Hn−1−p Y ) → 0. The ﬁrst map is given by cross products. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 71</a>)</p>
Corollary 3.7. If R is a ﬁeld, then H∗ (X × Y ) = H∗ (X) ⊗ H∗ (Y ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 71</a>)</p>
The Künneth formula implies that if R is a P.I.D., α × β = 0 if α = 0 and β = 0. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 71</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 3.8. If a ∈ H p X, b ∈ H q Y , the image of a ⊗ b under the composite H p X ⊗ H q Y ×alg ×alg A −−−→ H p+q ((S∗ X ⊗ S∗ Y )∗ ) − ∗ A∗ −→ H ∗ (X × Y ) map is called the cohomology cross product of a and b, and is denoted by a × b. 3.3.3. The cup product. Combining the the diagonal map ∆ : X → X × X, x → (x, x) with the cross product leads to the important cup product: Deﬁnition 3.9. If If a ∈ H p X, b ∈ H q X, then the cup product of a and b is deﬁned by a ∪ b = ∆∗ (a × b) ∈ H p+q X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=72" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 72</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 3.11. A diagonal approximation τ is a chain map τ : S∗ X → S ∗ X ⊗ S ∗ X for every space X, so that 1. τ (σ) = σ ⊗ σ for every 0-simplex σ. 2. τ is natural with respect to continuous maps of a spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=74" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 74</a>)</p>
If A is an Eilenberg-Zilber map and ∆ : X → X × X is the diagonal map, then τ = A ◦ ∆∗ is a diagonal approximation. Thus we can rephrase the deﬁnition of the cup product a ∪ b = τ ∗ (a ×alg b). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=74" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 74</a>)</p>
3.3.4. The cap product. Recall that the Kronecker pairing is a natural bilinear evaluation map (sometimes called “integration” by analogy with the deRham map)  ,  : S ∗ X × S∗ X → R deﬁned for a ∈ S q X, z ∈ Sp X by a, z =  a(z) if p = q, 0 otherwise. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=77" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 77</a>)</p>
This pairing can be extended to a “partial evaluation” or “partial integration” map E : S ∗ X ⊗ S∗ X ⊗ S ∗ X → S ∗ X by “evaluating the ﬁrst factor on the last factor”, i.e. E(a ⊗ z ⊗ w) = a(w) ⊗ z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=77" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 77</a>)</p>
Exercise 37. Let a, b ∈ H ∗ X and z ∈ H∗ X. Show that 1. a, b ∩ z = a ∪ b, z. 2. a ∩ (b ∩ z) = (a ∪ b) ∩ z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 78</a>)</p>
Thus the cap product makes the homology H∗ (X) a module over the ring H ∗ (X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 78</a>)</p>
Corollary 3.16. The cap product descends to a well deﬁned product ∩ : H q X × Hp+q X → Hp X ([α], [z]) → [α ∩ z] after passing to (co)homology. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 78</a>)</p>
3.3.5. The slant product. We next introduce the slant product which bears the same relation to the cross product as the cap product does to the cup product (this could be on an SAT test). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 78</a>)</p>
Often one distinguishes between internal products which are deﬁned in terms of one space X (such as the cup and cap products) and external products which involve the product of two spaces X × Y . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=79" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 79</a>)</p>
It is nevertheless often useful to work on the chain level, since there is subtle homotopy-theoretic information contained in the singular complex which leads to extra structure such as such as Steenrod operations and Massey products. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=79" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 79</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 3.19. The Alexander-Whitney map A : S∗ (X × Y ) → S∗ (X) ⊗ S∗ (Y ) is the natural transformation given by the formula A(σ) =  p+q=n p (pX ◦ σ) ⊗ (pY ◦ σ)q . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=80" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 80</a>)</p>
Exercise 40. Using the Alexander-Whitney diagonal approximation, 1. prove that S ∗ (X; R) is an associative ring with unit 1 represented by the cochain c ∈ S 0 (X; R) = Hom(S0 (X); R) which takes the value 1 on every singular 0-simplex in X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=80" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 80</a>)</p>
We have already seen that cohomology is an associative and graded commutative ring with unit in Theorem 3.13. However, the methods used there cannot be used to show that S ∗ (X) is an associative ring; in fact it is not for a random choice of Eilenberg-Zilber map A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 81</a>)</p>
The Alexander-Whitney map is a particularly nice choice of EilenbergZilber map because it does give an associative ring structure on S ∗ (X). This ring structure, alas, is not (graded) commutative (Steenrod squares give obstructions to its being commutative) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 81</a>)</p>
Notice that the deRham cochain complex of diﬀerential forms on a smooth manifold is graded commutative, since diﬀerential forms satisfy a ∧ b = ±b ∧ a. It is possible to give a natural construction of a commutative chain complex over the rationals which gives the rational homology of a space; this was done using rational diﬀerential forms on a simplicial complex by Sullivan. This fact is exploited in the subject of rational homotopy theory [14]. On the other hand it is impossible to construct a functor from spaces to commutative, associative chain complexes over Z which gives the integral homology of a space.

See Vick’s book [41] for a nice example of computing the cohomology ring of the torus directly using the Alexander-Whitney diagonal approximation.

The cup product of an q-dimensional cocycle with a q-dimensional cocycle generalizes the Kronecker pairing in the following sense. Proposition 3.21. For α ∈ H q X and z ∈ Hq X, α, z = <∗ (α ∩ z). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 82</a>)</p>
disappears when passing to cohomology. We now give a formal argument. We begin with some algebraic observations. Suppose (X, A) and (Y, B) are two pairs of spaces. Then S∗ X S∗ A ⊗ S∗ Y S∗ B ∼ = ∼ = S∗ X ⊗ S ∗ Y S∗ X ⊗ S ∗ B + S∗ A ⊗ S∗ Y . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 83</a>)</p>
Since a chain map between free chain complexes inducing an isomorphism on homology is a chain homotopy equivalence, this is equivalent to requiring that the inclusion map induces an isomorphism on homology. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 83</a>)</p>
Let V = H k (M ,Z)/T . So (V ,· ) is an inner product space over Z. This inner product space can have two kinds of symmetry. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 87</a>)</p>
If dim M = 2k, then H k (M ;Z)/T × H k (M ;Z)/T → Z called the intersection form of M . It is well-deﬁned and unimodular over Z, i.e. has determinant equal to ±1. Let V = H k (M ,Z)/T . So (V (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 87</a>)</p>
Case 1. k is odd. Thus dim M = 4F + 2. Then v · w = −w · v for v, w ∈ V , so (V ,· ) is a skew-symmetric and unimodular inner product space over Z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 87</a>)</p>
(V, · ) has matrix         0 1 −1 0 0 1 −1 0 . . .        (all other entries zero) in this basis. Such a basis is called a “symplectic basis”. The closed surface of genus r is an example; describe a symplectic basis geometrically (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 87</a>)</p>
basis geometrically. Hence unimodular skew-symmetric pairings over Z are classiﬁed by their rank. In other words, the integer intersection form of a 4k − 2-dimensional manifold M contains no more information than the dimension of H 2k+1 (M ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 87</a>)</p>
There are 3 invariants of such unimodular symmetric forms: 1. The rank of (V, · ) is the rank of V as a free abelian group. 2. The signature of (V, · ) is the diﬀerence of the number of positive eigenvalues and the number of negative eigenvalues in any matrix (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 87</a>)</p>
representation of (V, ·). (The eigenvalues of a symmetric real matrix are all real.) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 88</a>)</p>
Exercise 50. Show that although the eigenvalues of Q are not well deﬁned, their signs are well-deﬁned, so that the signature is well-deﬁned. (This is often called Sylvester’s Theorem of Inertia) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 88</a>)</p>
The type (odd or even) of (V, ·) is deﬁned to be even if and only if v · v is even for all v ∈ V . Otherwise the type is said to be odd. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 88</a>)</p>
The form (V, · ) is called deﬁnite if the absolute value of its signature equals its rank; i.e. the eigenvalues of Q are either all positive or all negative. The main result about unimodular integral forms is the following. For a proof see e.g. [29]. Theorem 3.27. If (V, · ), (W, · ) are two unimodular, symmetric, indeﬁnite forms over Z, then V and W are isometric (i.e. there exists an isomorphism V → W preserving the inner product) if and only if they have the same rank, signature, and type.

In fact, any odd indeﬁnite form is equivalent to ⊕  (1)⊕ m (−1), and any even indeﬁnite form is equivalent to (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 88</a>)</p>

The classiﬁcation of deﬁnite forms is not known. It is known that: 1. for each rank, there are ﬁnitely many isomorphism types. 2. If (V ,· ) is deﬁnite and even, then sign(V ,· ) ≡ 0 Mod 8.

Deﬁnition 3.28. The signature, sign M , of a compact, oriented 4k-manifold without boundary M is the signature of its intersection form H 2k (M ; Z)/T × H 2k (M ; Z)/T → Z The following sequence of exercises introduce the important technique of bordism in geometric topology.

Exercise 52. 1. Let M be a closed, odd–dimensional manifold. Show that the Euler characteristic χ(M ) = 0. Prove it for non-orientable manifolds, too. 2.

We have seen that even–dimensional manifolds admit intersection forms on the free part of their middle dimensional cohomology. For odd-dimensional manifolds one can construct the linking form on the torsion part of the “middle dimensional” cohomology as well (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=89" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 89</a>)</p>

The zig-zag lemma gives a long exact sequence in cohomology δ i · · · → H q−1 (X; Q/Z) − → H q (X; Z) − → H q (X; Q) → · · · . Exercise 54.

(The map δ is a Bockstein homomorphism; see Section 10.4) The bilinear map Q/Z × Z → Q/Z, (a, b) → ab is non-degenerate, in fact induces an isomorphism Q/Z ⊗ Z → Q/Z.

Deﬁnition 4.1. A topological group G acts on a space X if there is a group homomorphism G → Homeo(X) such that the “adjoint” G×X →X (g, x) → g(x) is continuous. We will usually write g · x instead of g(x).

∈ X is the set Gx = {g · x|g ∈ G}. The orbit space or quotient space X/G is the quotient space X/ , with the equivalence relation x g · x. The ﬁxed set is X G = {x ∈ X|g · x = x for all g ∈ G}. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=92" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 92</a>)</p>
The orbit of a point x ∈ X is (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=92" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 92</a>)</p>
An action is called free if g(x) = x for all x ∈ X and for all g = e. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=92" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 92</a>)</p>
An action is called eﬀective if the homomorphism G → Homeo(X) is injective.

A variant of this deﬁnition requires the homomorphism G → Homeo(X) to be continuous with respect to the compact-open topology on Homeo(X), or some other topology, depending on what X is (for example, one could ∞ take the C ∞ topology on Diﬀ(X) if X is a smooth manifold). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 93</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 4.2. Let G be a topological group acting eﬀectively on a space F . A ﬁber bundle E over B with ﬁber F and structure group G is a map p : E → B together with a collection of homeomorphisms {ϕ : U × F → p −1 (U )} for open sets U in B (ϕ is called a chart over U ) such that (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 93</a>)</p>
In a ﬁber bundle, the map ψϕ,ϕ must have a very special form, namely 1. The homeomorphism ψϕ,ϕ (u, −) : F → F is not arbitrary, but is given by the action of an element of G, i.e. ψϕ,ϕ (u, f ) = g · f for some g ∈ G independent of f . The element g is denoted by θϕ,ϕ (u). 2. The topology of G is integrated into the structure by requiring that θ ϕ,ϕ  : U → G be continuous.

The requirement that G act eﬀectively on F implies that the functions θ ϕ,ϕ  : U → G are unique. Although we have included the requirement that G acts eﬀectively of F in the deﬁnition of a ﬁber bundle, there are certain circumstances when we will want to relax this condition, particularly when studying liftings of the structure group, for example, when studying local coeﬃcients.

It is not hard to see that a locally trivial bundle is the same thing as a ﬁber bundle with structure group Homeo(F ).

One subtlety about the topology is that the requirement that G be a topological group acting eﬀectively on F says only that the homomorphism G → Homeo(F ) is injective, but the inclusion G → Homeo(F ) need not be an embedding, nor even continuous.

This is a useful method of understanding bundles since it relates them to (Čech) cohomology. Cohomologous cochains deﬁne isomorphic bundles, and so equivalence classes of bundles over B with structure group G can be (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=95" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 95</a>)</p>

G need not be abelian (and so what does H 1 (B; G) mean? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=96" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 96</a>)</p>

4.3.2. Bundles over S 2 . For every integer n ≥ 0, we can construct an S 1 bundle over S 2 with structure group SO(2); n is called the Euler number of the bundle. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 97</a>)</p>
or n ≥ 1, deﬁne a 3-dimensional lens space L3n n = S 3 /Zn , where the action is given by letting the generator of Zn on act on S 3 ⊂ C2 by (z1 , z2 ) → (ζ n z 1 , ζn z2 ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 97</a>)</p>
Deﬁne the S 1 -bundle with Euler number n ≥ 1 by p : L3n 3n → S 2 = C ∪ ∞ by [z1 , z2 ] → z1 /z2 .

When n = 1 we obtain the famous Hopf bundle S 1 → S 3 → S 2 . For n > 1 the Hopf map S 3 → S 2 factors through the quotient map S 3 → L3n 3n , and the ﬁbers of the bundle with Euler number n are S 1 /Zn which is again homeomorphic to S 1 .

For n = 0, we have the product bundle p : S 2 × S 1 → S 2 . For n ≥ 1, deﬁne a 3-dimensional lens space L3n n = S 3 /Zn (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 97</a>)</p>
Show that the spaces S(T S 2 ), SO(3), and RP 3 are all homeomorphic (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 97</a>)</p>
4.3.3. Clutching. Suppose a topological group G acts on a space F . Let X be a space and let ΣX be the unreduced suspension of X, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 97</a>)</p>
Then given a map β : X → G, deﬁne (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 98</a>)</p>
This bundle is called the bundle over ΣX with clutching function β : X → G ⊂Aut(F ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 98</a>)</p>
Clutching provides a good way to describe ﬁber bundles over spheres. For X a CW-complex, all bundles over ΣX arise by this clutching construction. This follows from the fact that any ﬁber bundle over a contractible CW-complex is trivial (this can be proven using obstruction theory) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 98</a>)</p>
4.3.4. Local coeﬃcients and other structures. An important type of ﬁber bundle is the following. Let A be a group and G a subgroup of the automorphism group Aut(A). Then any ﬁber bundle E over B with ﬁber A and structure group G has the property that each ﬁber p−1 {b} has a group structure. This group is isomorphic to A, but the isomorphism is not canonical in general. We have already run across an important case of this, namely vector bundles, where A = Rn and G = GLn (R). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 98</a>)</p>
In particular, if A is a abelian group with the discrete topology, then p : E → B is a covering space and is called a system of local coeﬃcients on B. T (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 98</a>)</p>
The basic principle at play here is if the structure group preserves a certain structure on F , then every ﬁber p−1 {b} has this structure. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 98</a>)</p>
Principal bundles are special cases of ﬁber bundles, but nevertheless can be used to construct any ﬁber bundle. Conversely any ﬁber bundle determines a principal bundle. A principal bundle is technically simpler, since the ﬁber is just F = G with a canonical action. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 99</a>)</p>
Let G be a topological group. It acts on itself by left translation. G → Homeo(G), g → (x → gx). Deﬁnition 4.3. A principal G-bundle over B is a ﬁber bundle p : P → B with ﬁber F = G and structure group G acting by left translations. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 99</a>)</p>
Proposition 4.4. If p : P → B is a principal G-bundle, then G acts freely on P on the right with orbit space B. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 99</a>)</p>
As a familiar example, any regular covering space p : E → B is a principal G-bundle with G = π1 B/p∗ π1 E. Here G is given the discrete topology. In particular, the universal covering B̃ → B of a space is a principal π1 Bbundle. A non-regular covering space is not a principal G-bundle. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 100</a>)</p>
Exercise 63. Any free (right) action of a ﬁnite group G on a (Hausdorﬀ) space E gives a regular cover and hence a principal G-bundle E → E/G. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 100</a>)</p>
Theorem 4.5. Suppose that X is a compact Hausdorﬀ space, and G is a compact Lie group acting freely on X. Then the orbit map X → X/G is a principal G-bundle. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 100</a>)</p>
As an application note that if a topological group G acts on spaces F and F  , and if p : E → B is a ﬁber bundle with ﬁber F and structure group G, then one can use the transition functions from p to deﬁne a ﬁber bundle p  : E  → B with ﬁber F  and structure group G with exactly the same transition functions.  This is called changing the ﬁber from F to F  (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 100</a>)</p>
This can be useful because  the topology of E and E  may change (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 100</a>)</p>
With the second incarnation of the bundle the twisting becomes revealed in the homotopy type, because the total space of the ﬁrst bundle has the homotopy type of S 2 , while the total space of the second has the homotopy type of the sphere bundle S(T S 2 ) and hence of RP 3 according to Exercise 59. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=101" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 101</a>)</p>
We call this principal G-bundle the principal G-bundle underlying the ﬁber bundle p : E → B with structure group G. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=101" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 101</a>)</p>
 A fundamental case of changing ﬁbers occurs when one lets the ﬁber F be the group G itself, with the left translation action. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=101" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 101</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 4.6. Let p : P → B be a principal G-bundle. Suppose G acts on the left on a space F , i.e. an action G × F → F is given. Deﬁne the Borel construction P ×G F to be the quotient space P × F/ ∼ where (x, f ) ∼ (xg, g −1 f ).

Thus principal bundles are more basic that ﬁber bundles, in the sense that the ﬁber and its G-action are explicit, namely G acting on itself by left translation. Moreover, any ﬁber bundle with structure group G is associated to a principal G-bundle by specifying an action of G on a space F . Many properties of bundles become more visible when stated in the context of principal bundles.

An important set of examples comes from this construction by starting with the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold M .

Deﬁne a space F (E) to be the space of frames in E, so that a point in F (E) is a pair (b, f ) where b ∈ B and f = (f1 , · · · , fn ) is a basis for the vector space p−1 (b) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=102" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 102</a>)</p>
Prove that q : F (E) → B is a principal GL(n, R)-bundle, and that E = F (E) ×GL(n,R) Rn (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=102" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 102</a>)</p>
We say q : E ×G F → B is the ﬁber bundle associated to the principal bundle p : E → B via the action of G on F .

Recall that a local coeﬃcient system is a ﬁber bundle over B with ﬁber A and structure group G where A is a (discrete) abelian group and G acts via a homomorphism G → Aut(A) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=103" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 103</a>)</p>
Lemma 4.7.

In other words the group G ⊂ Aut(A) can be replaced by the discrete group π1 B.

In some circumstances, given a subgroup H of G and a ﬁber bundle p : E → B with structure group G, one can view the bundle as a ﬁber bundle with structure group H. When this is possible, we say the structure group can be reduced to H.

Proposition 4.8. Let H be a topological subgroup of the topological group G. Let H act on G by left translation. Let q : Q → B be a principal H-bundle.

Deﬁnition 4.9.

For a ﬁber bundle, we say the structure group reduces if the structure group of the underlying principal bundle reduces.

In this more general context, for example, Lemma 4.7 states that any ﬁber bundle over B with discrete ﬁber can have its structure group reduced to π1 B.

One important type of ﬁber bundle map is a gauge transformation. This is a bundle map from a bundle to itself which covers the identity map of the base, i.e. the following diagram commutes.

Deﬁnition 4.12. Suppose that a ﬁber bundle p : E → B with ﬁber F and structure group G is given, and that f : B  → B is some continuous function.

The following exercise shows that any map of ﬁber bundles is given by a pullback.

4.7.1. Fiber bundles over paracompact bases are ﬁbrations. State and prove the theorem of Hurewicz (Theorem 6.8) which says that a map f : E → B with B paracompact is a ﬁbration (see Deﬁnition 6.7) provided that B has an open cover {Ui } so that f : f −1 (Ui ) → Ui is a ﬁbration for each i. In particular, any locally trivial bundle over a paracompact space is a ﬁbration.

4.7.2. Classifying spaces. For any topological group G there is a space BG and a principal G-bundle EG → BG so that given any paracompact space B, the pullback construction induces a bijection between the set [B, BG] of homotopy classes of maps from B to BG and isomorphism classes of principal G-bundles over B (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=107" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 107</a>)</p>
Show that given any action of G on F , any ﬁber bundle E → B with structure group G and ﬁber F is isomorphic to the pullback f ∗ (EG ×G F ) where f : B → BG classiﬁes the principal G-bundle underlying E → B.

When studying the homotopy theory of non-simply connected spaces, one is often led to consider an action of the fundamental group on some abelian group. Local coeﬃcient systems are a tool to organize this information. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=110" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 110</a>)</p>
There are two approaches to constructing the complexes giving the homology and cohomology of a space with local coeﬃcients. The ﬁrst is more algebraic, and takes the point of view that the fundamental chain complex associated to a space X is the singular (or cellular) complex of the universal cover X̃, viewed as a chain complex over the group ring Z[π1 X]. From this point of view local coeﬃcients are nothing more than modules over the group ring Z[π1 X].

The second approach is more topological; one takes a local coeﬃcient system over X (i.e. a ﬁber bundle over X whose ﬁbers are abelian groups and whose transition functions take values in the automorphisms of the group) and deﬁne a chain complex by taking the chains to be formal sums of singular simplices (or cells) such that the coeﬃcient of a simplex is an element in the ﬁber over that simplex (hence the terminology local coeﬃcients).

Let A be an abelian group and ρ : π → AutZ (A) be a homomorphism. (The standard terminology is to call either ρ or A a representation of π.) The representation ρ endows A with the structure of a left Zπ-module by taking the action   (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=111" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 111</a>)</p>

sentation of a group π on an abelian group is the same thing as a Zπ-module.

Deﬁnition 5.2. If R is a ring (possibly non-commutative), M is a right R-module, and N is a left R-module (sometimes one writes MR and R N ), then the tensor product M ⊗R N is an abelian group satisfying the adjoint property Hom Z (M ⊗R N, A) ∼ = ∼ = HomR (M, HomZ (N, A)) for any abelian group A. The corresponding universal property is that there is a Z-bilinear map φ : (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=112" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 112</a>)</p>
The tensor product is constructed by taking the free abelian group on M × N and modding out by the expected relations. Elements of M ⊗R N are denoted by  m i ⊗ n i . The relation mr ⊗ n = m ⊗ rn holds.

The starting point in the algebraic construction of homology with local coeﬃcients is the observation that the singular chain complex of the universal cover of a space is a right Zπ-module.

Deﬁnition 5.3. Given a Zπ-module A, form the tensor product S ∗ (X; A) = S∗ (X)⊗ Zπ A. X)⊗ This is a chain complex whose homology is called the homology of X with local coeﬃcients in A and is denoted by H∗ (X; A).

t since the ring Zπ is non-commutative (except if π is abelian), the tensored chain complex only has the structure of a chain complex over Z, not Zπ. Thus the homology group H∗ (X; A) is only a Z-module.

If the Zπ-module is speciﬁed by a representation ρ : π1 X →Aut(A) for some abelian group A, and we wish to emphasize the representation, we will sometimes embellish A with the subscript ρ and write H∗ (X; Aρ ) for the homology with coeﬃcients in A. It is also common to call H∗ (X; Aρ ) the homology of X twisted by ρ : π1 X →Aut(A).

5.2. Examples and basic properties The (ordinary) homology and cohomology groups are just special cases of the homology and cohomology with local coeﬃcients corresponding to twisting by the trivial representations ρ as we now show. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=113" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 113</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 5.4. Given a left Zπ-module A form the cochain complex S ∗ (X; A) = HomZπ (S∗ ( X A). X), (This means the set of group homomorphisms f : S∗ ( X → A which satisfy X) f (rz) = rf (z) for all r ∈ Zπ and z ∈ S∗ ( X X).) The cohomology of this complex is called the cohomology of X with local coeﬃcients in A, and is denoted by H ∗ (X; A).

If the module A is deﬁned by a representation ρ : π1 X →Aut(A) for an abelian group A, the cohomology with local coeﬃcients may be denoted by H ∗ (X; Aρ ) and is often called the cohomology of X twisted by ρ.

In other words, the homology with local coeﬃcients given by the tautological representation ρ : π → Aut(Zπ)   ρ(g) = ( mh h → mh gh) with (untwisted) Z coeﬃcients. equals the homology of X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=114" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 114</a>)</p>
These examples and the two exercises show that the (untwisted) homology of any cover of X with any coeﬃcients can be obtained as a special case of the homology of X with appropriate local coeﬃcients.

One might ask whether the same facts hold for cohomology. They do not without some modiﬁcation. If A = Zπ, then the cochain complex HomZπ (S∗ X, A) is not in general isomorphic to X, HomZ (S∗ X, Z) and Z). It turns out that if X is compact so H (X; Zπ) is not equal to H k (X; k H k (X; Zπ) ∼ Z), the compactly supported cohomology of X. = Hck (X; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=115" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 115</a>)</p>
→ X is the If p : X universal cover, then X inherits a CW-structure from X – the cells of X are the path components of the inverse images of cells of X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=115" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 115</a>)</p>
The following exercises are important in gaining insight into what information homology with local coeﬃcients captures. Exercise 76. Compute the cellular chain complex C∗ (S 1 ) as a Z[t, t−1 ]S module. Compute Hk (S 1 ; Aρ ) and H k 1 (S ; Aρ ) for any abelian group A and any homomorphism ρ : π1 S 1 = Z → Aut(A).

= Exercise 77. Let ρ : π1 (RP n ) − → Z/2 = Aut(Z). Compute Hk (RP n ; Zρ ) k n and H (RP ; Zρ ) and compare to the untwisted homology and cohomology. Exercise 78. Let p and q be a relatively prime pair of integers and denote by L(p,q) the 3-dimensional Lens space L(p,q) = S 3 /(Z/p), where Z/p = t acts on S 3 ⊂ C2 via q t(Z,W ) = (ζZ,ζ q W ) (ζ = e2πi/p ). Let ρ : Z/p → Aut(Z/n) = Z/(n − 1) for n prime. Compute H k (L(p,q); (Z/n)ρ ) and H k (L(p,q); (Z/n)ρ ).

Exercise 79. Let K be the Klein bottle. Compute Hn (K; Zρ ) for all twistings ρ of Z (i.e. all ρ : π1 K → Z/2 = Aut(Z)).

An important application of local coeﬃcients is its use in studying the algebraic topology of non-orientable manifolds. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=116" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 116</a>)</p>
For example, consider RP n for n even. The orientation double cover is S n ; the deck transformation reverses orientation. For RP n for n odd, the orientation double cover is a disjoint union of two copies of RP n , oriented with the opposite orientations. If M is a connected manifold, deﬁne the orientation character or the ﬁrst Stiefel–Whitney class w : π1 M → {±1} (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=116" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 116</a>)</p>
by w[γ] = 1 if γ lifts to a loop in the orientation double cover and w[γ] = −1 if γ lifts to a path which is not a loop. Intuitively, w[γ] = −1 if going around the loop γ reverses the orientation. M is orientable if and only if w is trivial.

Corollary 5.6. Any manifold with H 1 (M ; Z/2) = 0 is orientable.

Notice that Aut(Z) = {±1} and so the orientation character deﬁnes a representation w : π1 X → Aut(Z). The corresponding homology and cohomology Hk (X; Zw ), H k (X; Zw ) is called the homology and cohomology of X twisted by the orientation character w, or with local coeﬃcients in the orientation sheaf.

The homology of the chain complex (Sk (X; E), ∂) is called the homology with local coeﬃcients in E.

Here is the example involving orientability of manifolds, presented in terms of local coeﬃcients instead of the orientation representation. Let M be an n-dimensional manifold.

Then E → X is a local coeﬃcient system with ﬁbers Hn (M, M − {x}) ∼ = ∼ = Z, called the orientation sheaf of M .

In particular, there is a Mayer-Vietoris sequence for homology with local coeﬃcients which gives a method for computing. Some care must be taken in using this theorem because local coeﬃcients do not always extend (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=122" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 122</a>)</p>
Given a homomorphism ρ : π1 (X − U ) → Aut(A) and an inclusion of pairs (X − U, B − U ) → (X, B) excision holds (i.e. the inclusion of pairs induces isomorphisms in homology with local coeﬃcients) only if ρ extends over π1 (X). In particular the morphism of local coeﬃcients must (exist and) be isomorphisms on ﬁbers.

Proposition 5.14. Let B be a path connected CW-complex, π = π1 (B) and V a Zπ-module. then 1.

5.5.1. The Hopf degree theorem. This theorem states that the degree of a map f : S n → S n determines its homotopy class. See Theorems 6.67 and 8.5.

Colimits and limits are important categorical constructions in algebra and topology. Special cases include the notions of a cartesian product, a disjoint union, a pullback, a pushout, a quotient space X/A, and the topology of a CW-complex (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=124" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 124</a>)</p>
If all the Xi are subsets of a set A and if all the fi ’s are inclusions of subspaces show that the colimit can be taken to X = ∪Xi . The topology is given by saying U ⊂ X is open if and only if U ∩ Xi is open for all i. Thus such a colimit can be thought of as some sort of generalization of a union (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=124" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 124</a>)</p>
Consider the categories {· → · → · → · → · · · }, {· · · ← · ← · ← · ←}, {· → · ← ·}, {· ← · → ·}, {· ·}, and discuss how colimits and limits over these categories give the above colimit, the above limit, the pullback, the pushout, the cartesian product and the disjoint union.

Now let I be a category and let T be the category of topological spaces. Let X : I → T , i → Xi be a functor, so you are given a topological space for every object i, and the morphisms of I give oodles of maps between the Xi satisfying the same composition laws as the morphisms in I do.

Finally suppose that Y is a CW-complex and Y0 ⊂ Y1 ⊂ Y2 ⊂ Y3 ⊂ · · · is an increasing union of subcomplexes whose union is Y . Show that Hn Y = colim i→∞ Hn (Y i i ).

6.1. Compactly generated spaces Given a map f : X×Y → Z, we would like to topologize the set of continuous functions C(Y, Z) in such way that f is continuous if and only if the adjoint ˜ f˜ : X → C(Y, Z), f˜(x)(y) = f (x, y) is continuous (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=126" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 126</a>)</p>
continuous. Here are three examples: 1. We would like an action of a topological group G × Z → Z to correspond to a continuous function G → Homeo(Z), where Homeo(Z) is given the subspace topology inherited from C(Z, Z). 2. We would like a homotopy f : I × Y → Z to correspond to a path ˜ f˜ : I → C(Y, Z) of functions. 3. The evaluation map C(Y, Z) × Y → Z, (f, y) → f (y) should be continuous. (Is the evaluation map an adjoint?)

Unfortunately, such a topology on C(Y, Z) is not possible, even for Hausdorﬀ topological spaces, unless you bend your point of view (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=126" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 126</a>)</p>
The category of compactly generated spaces is a framework which permits one to make such constructions without worrying about these technical issues (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 127</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.1. A topological space X is said to be compactly generated if X is Hausdorﬀ and if a subset A ⊂ X is closed if and only if A ∩ C is closed for every compact C ⊂ X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 127</a>)</p>

Examples of compactly generated spaces include: 1. locally compact Hausdorﬀ spaces (e.g. manifolds), 2. metric spaces, and (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 127</a>)</p>
We will use the notation K for the category of compactly generated spaces. (This is taken as a full subcategory of the category of all topological spaces, i.e. every continuous function between compactly generated spaces is a morphism in K.) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 127</a>)</p>
Hausdorﬀ space can be turned into a compactly generated space by the following trick. Deﬁnition 6.2. If X is Hausdorﬀ, let k(X) be the set X with the new topology deﬁned by declaring a subset A ⊂ X to be closed in k(X) if and only if A ∩ C is closed in X for all C ⊂ X compact. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 127</a>)</p>
6.1.1. Basic facts about compactly generated spaces. 1. If X ∈ K, then k(X) = X. 2. If f : X → Y is a function, then k(f ) : k(X) → k(Y ) is continuous if and only if f |C : C → Y is continuous for each compact C ⊂ X. 3. Let C(X, Y ) denote the set of continuous functions from X to Y . Then k∗ : C(X, k(Y )) → C(X, Y ) is a bijection if X is in K. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 127</a>)</p>
4. The singular chain complexes of a Hausdorﬀ space Y and the space k(Y ) are the same. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 128</a>)</p>
6.1.2. Products in K. Unfortunately, the product of compactly generated spaces need not be compactly generated. However, this causes little concern, as we now see. Deﬁnition 6.3. Let X, Y be compactly generated spaces. The categorical product of X and Y is the space k(X × Y ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 128</a>)</p>
The following useful facts hold about the categorical product. 1. k(X × Y ) is in fact a product in the category K. 2. If X is locally compact and Y is compactly generated, then X × Y = k(X × Y ). In particular, I × Y = k(I × Y ). Thus the notion of homotopy is unchanged.

6.1.3. Function spaces. The standard way to topologize the set of functions C(X, Y ) is to use the compact-open topology. Deﬁnition 6.4. If X and Y are compactly generated spaces, let C(X, Y ) denote the set of continuous functions from X to Y , topologized with the compact-open topology. This topology has as a subbasis sets of the form U (K, W ) = {f ∈ C(X, Y )|f (K) ⊂ W } where K is a compact set in X and W an open set in Y . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 128</a>)</p>
If Y is a metric space, this is the notion, familiar from complex analysis, of uniform convergence on compact sets (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 128</a>)</p>
Unfortunately, even for compactly generated spaces X and Y , C(X, Y ) need not be compactly generated. We know how to handle this problem: deﬁne Map(X, Y ) = k(C(X, Y )). As a set, Map(X, Y ) is the set of continuous maps from X to Y , but its topology is slightly diﬀerent from the compact open topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=128" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 128</a>)</p>
Theorem 6.5 (adjoint theorem). For X, Y , and Z compactly generated, f (x, y) → f˜(x)(y) gives a homeomorphism Map((X × Y ), Z) → Map(X, Map(Y, Z)) Thus − × Y and Map(Y, −) are adjoint functors from K to K. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=129" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 129</a>)</p>
6.1.4. Quotient maps. We discuss yet another convenient property of compactly generated spaces. For topological spaces, one can give an example of quotient maps p : W → Y and q : X → Z so that p × q : W × X → Y × Z is not a quotient map. However, one can show the following. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=129" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 129</a>)</p>
The following useful properties of Map(X, Y ) hold. 1. Let e : Map(X, Y ) × X → Y be the evaluation e(f, x) = f (x). Then if X, Y ∈ K, e is continuous. 2. If X, Y, Z ∈ K, then: (a) Map(X, Y × Z) is homeomorphic to Map(X, Y ) × Map(X, Z), (b) Composition deﬁnes a continuous map Map(X, Y ) × Map(Y, Z) → Map(X, Z). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=129" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 129</a>)</p>
Theorem 6.6. 1. If p : W → Y and q : X → Z are quotient maps, and X and Z are locally compact Hausdorﬀ, then p × q is a quotient map. 2. If p : W → Y and q : X → Z are quotient maps and all space are compactly generated, then p × q is a quotient map, provided we use the categorical product.

By this convention, we lose no information concerning homology and homotopy, but we gain the adjoint theorem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=129" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 129</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.7. A continuous map p : E → B is a ﬁbration if it has the homotopy lifting property (HLP); i.e. the problem g̃ Y × {0} ✲ E Y ×I ✲ B G g̃ ✲ ❄p p ❄ p ✲ G p p p p pp p p p p pp p p p p p p p p✒ pp p pp ✒ ̃ G̃ has a solution for every space Y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 130</a>)</p>
In other words, given the continuous maps p, G, g̃, and the inclusion Y × {0} → Y × I, the problem is to ﬁnd a continuous map G̃ making the diagram commute. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 130</a>)</p>
A covering map is a ﬁbration. In studying covering space theory this fact is called the covering homotopy theorem. For covering maps the lifting is unique, but this is not true for an arbitrary ﬁbration. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 130</a>)</p>
The following theorem of Hurewicz says that if a map is locally a ﬁbration, then it is so globally. Theorem 6.8. Let p : E → B be a continuous map. Suppose that B is paracompact and suppose that there exists an open cover {Uα } of B so that p : p −1 (Uα ) → Uα is a ﬁbration for each Uα . Then p : E → B is a ﬁbration. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 130</a>)</p>
Corollary 6.9. If p : E → B is a ﬁber bundle over a paracompact space B, then p is a ﬁbration. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 130</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.11. If p : E → B is a ﬁbration, and f : X → B a continuous map, deﬁne the pullback of p : E → B by f to be the map f ∗ (E) → X where f ∗ (E) = {(x,e) ∈ X × E|f (x) = p(e)} ⊂ X × E and the map f ∗ (E) → B is the restriction of the projection X × E → X.

A ﬁbration need not be a ﬁber bundle. Indeed, the deﬁnition of a ﬁbration is less rigid than that of a ﬁber bundle and it is not hard to alter a ﬁber bundle slightly to get a ﬁbration which is not locally trivial. Nevertheless, a ﬁbration has a well deﬁned ﬁber up to homotopy. The following theorem asserts this, and also states that a ﬁbration has a substitute for the structure group of a ﬁber bundle, namely the group of homotopy classes of self-homotopy equivalences of the ﬁber (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=131" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 131</a>)</p>
Theorem 6.12. Let p : E → B be a ﬁbration. Assume B is path connected. Then all ﬁbers Eb = p −1 (b) are homotopy equivalent. Moreover every path α : I → B deﬁnes a homotopy class α∗ of homotopy equivalences Eα(0) → Eα(1) which depends only on the homotopy class of α rel endpoints, in such a way that multiplication of paths corresponds to composition of homotopy equivalences. In particular, there exists a well-deﬁned group homomorphism [α] → (α −1 )∗ π1 (B, b0 ) → Homotopy classes of self-homotopy equivalences of Eb0 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=132" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 132</a>)</p>
Since homotopy equivalences induce isomorphisms in homology or cohomology, a ﬁbration with ﬁber F gives rise to local coeﬃcients systems whose ﬁber is the homology or cohomology of F , as the next corollary asserts. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 135</a>)</p>
Corollary 6.13. Let p : E → B be a ﬁbration and let F = p−1 (b0 ). Then p gives rise to local coeﬃcient systems over B with ﬁber Hn (F ; M ) or H n (F ; M ) for any n and any coeﬃcient group M . These local coeﬃcients are obtained from the representations via the composite homomorphism π1 (B,b0 ) →  Homotopy classes of self-homotopy equivalences F → F → Aut(A) where A = Hn (F ; M ) or A = H n (F ; M ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 135</a>)</p>
We see that a ﬁbration gives rise to many local coeﬃcient systems, by taking homology or cohomology of the ﬁber. More generally one obtains a local coeﬃcient system given any homotopy functor from spaces to abelian groups (or R-modules), such as the generalized homology theories which we introduce in Chapter 8. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 135</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.14. Let (Y, y0 ) be a based space. The path space Py0 Y is the space of paths in Y starting at y0 , i.e. Py0 Y = Map(I,0; Y ,y0 ) ⊂ Map(I,Y ), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=135" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 135</a>)</p>
The loop space Ωy0 Y is the space of all loops in Y based at y0 , i.e. Ωy0 Y = Map(I,{0,1}; Y ,{y0 }). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=136" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 136</a>)</p>
Often the subscript y0 is omitted in the above notation. Let Y I I = Map(I, Y ). This is called the free path space. Let p : Y I I → Y be the evaluation at the end point of a path: p(α) = α(1). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=136" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 136</a>)</p>
1. The map p : Y I I → Y , where p(α) = α(1), is a ﬁbration. Its ﬁber over y0 is the space of paths which end at y0 , a space homeomorphic to Py0 Y . 2. The map p : Py0 Y → Y is a ﬁbration. Its ﬁber over y0 is the loop space Ωy0 Y . 3. The free path space Y I I is homotopy equivalent to Y . The projection p : Y I I → Y is a homotopy equivalence. 4. The space of paths in Y starting at y0 , Py0 Y , is contractible.

Deﬁnition 6.16. A ﬁber homotopy between two morphisms ( ˜i f˜i , fi ) i = 0, 1 of ﬁbrations is a commutative diagram E×I H✲ E B×I ✲ B H ✲ H H ❄ p×Id ❄ p  ✲ H with H0 = f0 , H1 = f1 , H 0 = f H ˜0 f˜0 , and H H 1 = f ˜1 f˜1 .

Given two ﬁbrations over B, p : E → B and p : E  → B, we say they have the same ﬁber homotopy type if there exists a map ˜ f˜ from E to E  covering the identity map of B, and a map g̃ from E  to E covering the identity map of B, such that the composites E ✲ E E  E  B B ❅ ❘ ❅ g̃◦f˜ ✲ ✠ ❅ ❘ ❅ ✲ ˜ f˜◦g̃ ✠ are each ﬁber homotopic to the identity via a homotopy which is the identity on (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=138" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 138</a>)</p>
Notice that a ﬁber homotopy equivalence f ˜ f˜ : E → E  induces a homotopy equivalence Eb0 → Eb 0 on ﬁbers.

Let f : X → Y be a continuous map. We will replace X by a homotopy equivalent space Pf and obtain a map Pf → Y which is a ﬁbration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=138" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 138</a>)</p>
Let q : Y I I → Y be the path space ﬁbration, with q(α) = α(0); evaluation at the starting point (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=138" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 138</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.17. The pullback Pf = f ∗ (Y I I ) of the path space ﬁbration along f is called the mapping path space. Pf = f ∗ (Y I I ) ✲ YI X ✲ Y f ✲ ❄ ❄ q ✲ f (6.1) An element of Pf is a pair (x, α) where α is a path in Y and x is a point in X which maps via f to the starting point of α. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=139" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 139</a>)</p>
The mapping path ﬁbration p : Pf → Y is obtaining by evaluating at the end point p(x, α) = α(1) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=139" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 139</a>)</p>
Given a map f : X → Y , it is common to be sloppy and say “F is the ﬁber of f ”, or “F → X → Y is a ﬁbration” to mean that after replacing X by the homotopy equivalent space Pf and the map f by the ﬁbration Pf → Y , the ﬁber is a space of the homotopy type of F . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=142" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 142</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.19. A map i : A → X is called a coﬁbration, or satisﬁes the homotopy extension property (HEP), if the following diagram has a solution (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=142" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 142</a>)</p>
Coﬁbration is a “dual” notion to ﬁbration, using the adjointness of the functors − × I and −I , and reversing the arrows. To see this, note that since a map A × I → B is the same as a map A → B I , the diagram deﬁning a ﬁbration f : X → Y can be written X ✛ eval. at 0 XI Z ✲ Y I. ❄ f ✛ eval. at 0 ✻ ✲ p p pp p p p p p pp p p p pp p pp The diagram deﬁning a coﬁbration f : Y → X can be written as (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=143" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 143</a>)</p>
For “reasonable” spaces, any coﬁbration i : A → X can be shown to be an embedding whose image is closed in X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=143" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 143</a>)</p>
Deﬁnition 6.20. Let X be compactly generated, A ⊂ X a subspace. Then (X,A) is called an NDR–pair (NDR stands for “neighborhood deformation retract”) if there exist (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=143" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 143</a>)</p>
In particular the neighborhood U = {x ∈ X|u(x) < 1} of A deformation retracts to A.

Theorem 6.22 (Steenrod). Equivalent are: 1. (X,A) is an NDR pair. 2. (X × I, X × 0 ∪ A × I) is a DR pair. 3. X × 0 ∪ A × I is a retract of X × I. 4. i : A → X is a coﬁbration.

paracompact spaces are ﬁbrations. Theorem 6.23. If X is a CW-complex, and A ⊂ X a subcomplex, then (X,A) is a NDR pair (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=145" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 145</a>)</p>

Exercise 91. If (X, A) and (Y, B) are coﬁbrations, so is their product (X, A) × (Y, B) = (X × Y, X × B ∪ A × Y ). We next establish that a pushout of a coﬁbration is a coﬁbration; this is dual to the fact that pullback of a ﬁbration is a ﬁbration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=145" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 145</a>)</p>

Pushouts always exist. They are constructed as follows. When A is empty the pushout is the disjoint union B  C. A concrete realization is given by choosing base points b0 ∈ B and c0 ∈ C and setting BC = {(b, c0 , 0) ∈ B × C × I | b ∈ B} ∪ {(b0 , c, 1) ∈ B × C × I | c ∈ C}. In general, a concrete realization for the pushout of f : A → B and g : A → C is BC f (a) ∼ g(a) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=146" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 146</a>)</p>
Let f : A → X be a continuous map. We will replace X by a homotopy equivalent space Mf and obtain a map A → Mf which is a coﬁbration.

The mapping cylinder of a map f : A → X is the space Mf = (A × I)  X (a, 1) ∼ f (a) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=146" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 146</a>)</p>
If f : A → X is a coﬁbration, then h is a homotopy equivalence rel A, in particular h induces a homotopy equivalence of the coﬁbers Cf → X/f (A).

Deﬁnition 6.28. A sequence of functions A f f − →B g g − →C of sets (not spaces or groups) with base points is called exact at B if f (A) = g −1 (c0 ) where c0 is the base point of C.

The following two theorems form the cornerstone of constructions of exact sequences in algebraic topology. Theorem 6.29 (basic property of ﬁbrations). Let p : E → B be a ﬁbration, with ﬁber F = p −1 (b0 ) and B path-connected. Let Y be any space. Then the sequence of sets [Y ,F ] i∗ i∗ −→ [Y ,E] p∗ p∗ −→ [Y ,B] is exact.

Theorem 6.30 (basic property of coﬁbrations). Let i : A → X be a coﬁbration, with coﬁber X/A. Let q : X → X/A denote the quotient map. Let Y be any path-connected space. Then the sequence of sets [X/A,Y ] q ∗ −→ [X,Y ] i ∗ i∗ −→ [A,Y ] is exact.

ﬁnition 6.31. Deﬁne K∗ to be the category of compactly generated spaces with a non-degenerate base point, i.e. (X,x0 ) is an object of K∗ if the inclusion {x0 } ⊂ X is a coﬁbration. The morphisms in K∗ are the base point preserving continuous maps.

Deﬁnition 6.32. The smash product of based spaces is X ∧Y = X ×Y X ∨Y = X ×Y X × {y0 } ∪ {x0 } ∪ Y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=152" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 152</a>)</p>
Note that the smash product X∧Y is a based space. Contrary to popular belief, the smash product is not the product in the category K∗ , although the wedge product X ∨ Y = (X × {y0 }) ∪ ({x0 } × Y ) ⊂ X × Y is the sum in K∗ . The smash product is the adjoint of the based mapping space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=152" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 152</a>)</p>

Deﬁnition 6.34. The (reduced) suspension of a based space (X, x0 ) is SX = S 1 ∧ X. The (reduced) cone is CX = I ∧ X.

In other words, if ΣX is the unreduced suspension and cone(X) is the unreduced cone (= ΣX/X × {0}), then there are quotient maps ΣX → SX cone(X) → CX given by identifying {x0 } × I shaded in the following ﬁgure.

Proposition 6.35. The reduced suspension SS n is homeomorphic to S n+1 and the reduced cone CS n is homeomorphic to D n+1 .

Theorem 6.37 (loops and suspension are adjoints).

We will see eventually that the homotopy type of a ﬁber of a ﬁbration measures how far the ﬁbration is from being a homotopy equivalence. (For example, if the ﬁber is contractible then the ﬁbration is a homotopy equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=154" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 154</a>)</p>
) More generally given a map f : X → Y , one can turn it into a ﬁbration Pf → Y as above; the ﬁber of this ﬁbration measures how far f is from a homotopy equivalence.

After turning f : X → Y into a ﬁbration Pf → Y one then has an inclusion of the ﬁber F ⊂ Pf . Why not turn this into a ﬁbration and see what happens? Now take the ﬁber of the resulting ﬁbration and continue the process . . .

A loop space is a example of an H-group and a suspension is an example of a co-H-group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=158" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 158</a>)</p>
, but here is the basic idea. An H-group Z is a based space with a “multiplication” map µ : Z × Z → Z and an “inversion” map ϕ : X → X which satisfy the axioms of a group up to homotopy (e.g. is associative up to homotopy). For a topological group G and any space X, Map(X, G) is a group, similarly for an H-group Z, [X, Z]0 is a group. To deﬁne a co-H-group, one reverses all the arrows in the deﬁnition of H- (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=158" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 158</a>)</p>
group, so there is a co-multiplication ν : W → W ∨ W and a co-inversion (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=158" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 158</a>)</p>
ψ : W → W . Then [W, X]0 is a group. Finally, there is a formal, but occasionally very useful result. If W is a co-H-group and Z is an H-group, then the two multiplications on [W, Z]0 agree and are abelian. Nifty, huh? One consequence of this is that π1 (X, x0 ) of an H-group (e.g. a topological group) is abelian (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=159" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 159</a>)</p>
Theorem 6.42 (Puppe sequences). Let Y ∈ K∗ . 1.

In particular, πn X = π1 (Ω n−1 X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=159" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 159</a>)</p>
For example, to get a hold of the group structure for writing down a proof, use πn (X, x0 ) = [(I n , ∂I n ), (X, x0 )]. For the proof of the exact sequence of a pair (coming later) use πn (X, x0 ) = [(D n , S n−1 ), (X, x0 )]. For ﬁnding a geometric interpretation of the boundary map in the homotopy long exact sequence of a ﬁbration given below, use πn (X, x0 ) = [(S n−1 × I, (S n−1 × ∂I) ∪ (∗ × I)), (X, x0 )].

Finally, the homotopy type of a CWcomplex X is determined by the homotopy groups of X together with a cohomological recipe (the k-invariants) for assembling these groups.

Exercise 100. GK is a compact Lie group homeomorphic to S r for r = 0, 1, 3.

Returning to the other exact sequences, it follows from the cellular approximation theorem that πn S 4 = πn−1 S 3 for n ≤ 6 (since πn (S 7 ) = 0 for n ≤ 6), and that πn S 8 = πn−1 S 7 for n ≤ 14.

The Grassmann manifold or grassmannian Gk (R n ) is the space of kdimensional subspaces (a.k.a. k-planes) in R n .

Let G be a compact Lie group. Let H ⊂ G be a closed subgroup (and hence a Lie group itself). The quotient G/H is called a homogeneous space. The (group) quotient map G → G/H is a principal H-bundle since H acts freely on G by right translation. If H has a closed subgroup K, then H acts on the homogeneous space H/K. Changing the ﬁber of the above bundle results in a ﬁber bundle G/K → G/H with ﬁber H/K.

clutching (see Section 4.3.3) corresponds to a bundle over S k+1 with structure group O(n).

is a principal G-bundle EG → BG where EG is contractible.

Corollary 6.50. The inﬁnite grassmannian Gk (R ∞ ) is a model for BO(k). The principal O(k) bundle O(k) → Vk (R ∞ ) → Gk (R ∞ ) is universal and classiﬁes principal O(k)-bundles. The canonical bundle R k → γk (R ∞ ) → Gk (R ∞ ) classiﬁes R k -vector bundles with structure group O(k) (i.e. R k -vector bundles equipped with metric on each ﬁber which varies continuously from ﬁber to ﬁber). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=166" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 166</a>)</p>
The fact that the grassmannian classiﬁes orthogonal vector bundles makes sense from a geometric point of view.

Moreover, Gk (R ∞ ) is also a model for BGLk (R) and hence is a classifying space for k-plane bundles over CW-complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=167" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 167</a>)</p>
This follows either by redoing the above discussion, replacing k-frames by sets of k-linearly independent vectors, or by using the fact that O(k) → GLk (R) is a homotopy equivalence, with the homotopy inverse map being given by the Gram-Schmidt process.

Similar statements apply in the complex setting to unitary groups U (n). Let Gk (C n ) = complex k-planes in C n Gk (C n ) = U (n)/(U (k) × U (n − k)), the complex grassmanian Vk (C n ) = U (n)/U (n − k), the unitary Stiefel manifold.

Moreover, V1 (C n ) ∼ = ∼ = S 2n−1 , therefore πk (U (n)) ∼ = ∼ = πk (U (n − 1)) if k < 2n − 2 and so letting U = lim n→∞ U (n), we conclude that πk U = πk (U (n)) for n > 1 + k 2 .

Taking determinants give ﬁbrations SO(n) → O(n) det det −−→ {±1} and SU (n) → U (n) det det −−→ S 1 . In particular, SO(n) is the identity path–component of O(n), so πk (SO(n)) = πk (O(n)) for k ≥ 1.

Exercise 110. Using Exercise 109 and the facts: 1. πn S n = Z (Hopf degree Theorem). 2. πk S n = 0 for k < n (Hurewicz theorem). 3. πk S ∼ n = ∼ πk+1 S = n+1 for k < 2n − 1 (Freudenthal suspension theorem). 4. There is a covering Z → R → S 1 . 5. πn S n−1 = Z/2 for n > 3 (this theorem is due to V. Rohlin and G. Whitehead; see Corollary 9.27).

Deﬁnition 6.52. The relative homotopy group (set if n = 1) of the pair (X, A) is πn (X, A, x0 ) = [D n , S n−1 , p; X, A, x0 ], the set of based homotopy classes of base point preserving maps from the pair (D n , S n−1 ) to (X, A). This is a functor from pairs of spaces to sets (n = 1), groups (n = 2), and abelian groups (n > 2).

Theorem 6.53 (long exact sequence in homotopy of a pair). The homotopy set πn (X, A) is a group for n ≥ 2, and is abelian for n ≥ 3. Moreover, there is a long exact sequence · · · → πn A → πn X → πn (X, A) → πn−1 A → · · · → π1 (X, A) → π0 A → π0 X.

Exercise 111. Concoct an argument from this picture and use it to ﬁgure out why π1 (X, A) is not a group. Also use it to prove that the long exact sequence is exact.

Lemma 6.54. Let f : E → B be a ﬁbration with ﬁber F . Let A ⊂ B be a subspace, and let G = f −1 (A), so that F → G f f − → A is a ﬁbration. Then f induces isomorphims f∗ : πk (E, G) → πk (B, A) for all k. In particular, taking A = {b0 } one obtains the commuting ladder (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=169" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 169</a>)</p>

Notice that the commutativity of this diagram and the fact that f∗ is an isomorphism gives an alternative deﬁnition of the connecting homomorphism πk (B) → πk−1 (F ) in the long exact sequence of the ﬁbration F → E → B.

An alternative and useful perspective on Theorem 6.53 is obtained by replacing a pair by a ﬁbration as follows. Turn A → X into a ﬁbration, with A replacing A and L(X, A) the ﬁber.

Homotopy groups are harder to compute and deal with than homology groups, essentially because excision fails for relative homotopy groups. In Chapter 8 we will discuss stable homotopy and generalized homology theories, in which (properly interpreted) excision does hold. Stabilization is a procedure which looks at a space X only in terms of what homotopy information remains in S n X as n gets large. The ﬁber L(X, A) and coﬁber X/A are stably homotopy equivalent.

Theorem 6.57. This deﬁnes an action of π1 (Y, y0 ) on the based set [X, Y ]0 , and [X, Y ] is the quotient set of [X, Y ]0 by this action if Y is path connected.

Now π1 (Y, y0 ) can be identiﬁed with group of covering transformations of ̃ Ỹ . Thus, π1 (Y, y0 ) acts on [X, Y ̃ Ỹ ] by post composition i.e. α : ̃ Ỹ → Ỹ acts on f : X → Ỹ by α ◦ f .

Corollary 6.60. For any space Y , π1 (Y, y0 ) acts on πn (Y, y0 ) for all n with quotient [S n , Y ], the set of free homotopy classes.

One could restrict to simply connected spaces Y and never worry about the distinction between based and unbased homotopy classes of maps into Y . This is not practical in general, and so instead one can make a dimensionby-dimension deﬁnition. Deﬁnition 6.61. We say Y is n-simple if π1 Y acts trivially on πn Y . We say Y is simple if Y is n-simple for all n.

Proposition 6.62. If F is n-simple, then the ﬁbration F → E → B deﬁnes a local coeﬃcient system over B with ﬁber πn F .

(A good example to think about is the Klein bottle mapping onto the circle.)

Thus, we obtain a homomorphism ρ : π1 B → Aut(πn (F )), i.e. a local coeﬃcient system over B.

Theorem 6.63. The group π1 A acts on πn (X, A), πn X, and πn A for all n. Moreover, the long exact sequence of the pair · · · → πn A → πn X → πn (X, A) → πn−1 A → · · · is π1 A-equivariant.

Deﬁnition 6.65. The Hurewicz map ρ : πn X → Hn X is deﬁned by ρ([f ]) = f∗ ([S n ]), where f : S n → X represents an element of πn X, [S n ] ∈ Hn S n ∼ = ∼ = Z is the generator (given by the natural orientation of S n ) and f∗ : Hn S n → Hn X the induced map.

The following theorem is the subject of one of the projects for this chapter. It says that for simply connected spaces, the ﬁrst non-vanishing homotopy and homology groups coincide. The Hurewicz theorem is the most important result in algebraic topology. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=177" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 177</a>)</p>
Theorem 6.66 (Hurewicz theorem). 1. Let n > 0. Suppose that X is path-connected. If πk (X, x0 ) = 0 for all k < n, then Hk (X) = 0 for all 0 < k < n, and the Hurewicz map ρ : πn X → H n X is an isomorphism if n > 1, and a surjection with kernel the commutator subgroup of π1 X if n = 1. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=177" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 177</a>)</p>
2. Let n > 1. Suppose X and A are path-connected. If πk (X, A) = 0 for all k < n then Hk (X, A) = 0 for all k < n, and ρ : π + n+ (X, A) → Hn (X, A) is an isomorphism. In particular ρ : πn (X, A) → Hn (X, A) is an epimorphism.

Corollary 6.67 (Hopf degree theorem). The Hurewicz map ρ : πn S n → Hn S n is an isomorphism. Hence a degree zero map f : S n → S n is nullhomotopic. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=177" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 177</a>)</p>
Although we have stated this as a corollary of the Hurewicz theorem, it can be proven directly using only the (easy) simplicial approximation theorem.

Deﬁnition 6.68. 1. A space X is called n-connected if πk X = 0 for k ≤ n. (Thus “simply connected” is synonymous with 1-connected). 2. A pair (X, A) is called n-connected if πk (X, A) = 0 for k ≤ n. 3. A map f : X → Y is called n-connected if the pair (Mf , X) is nconnected, where Mf = mapping cylinder of f .

Using the long exact sequence for (Mf , X) and the homotopy equivalence Mf ∼ Y we see that f is n-connected if and only if f∗ : πk X → πk Y is an isomorphism for k < n and an epimorphism for k = n. Replacing the map f : X → Y by a ﬁbration and using the long exact sequence for the (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=177" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 177</a>)</p>
homotopy groups of a ﬁbration shows that f is n-connected if and only if the homotopy ﬁber of f is (n − 1)-connected. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
Corollary 6.69 (Whitehead theorem). 1. If f : X → Y is n-connected, then f∗ : Hq X → Hq Y is an isomorphism for all q < n and an epimorphism for q = n. 2. If X, Y are 1-connected, and f : X → Y is a map such that f∗ : Hq X → Hq Y is an isomorphism for all q < n and an epimorphism for q = n. Then f is n-connected. 3. If X, Y are 1-connected spaces, f : X → Y a map inducing an isomorphism on Z-homology, then f induces isomorphisms f∗ : πk X ∼ = ∼ = = − → πk Y for all k. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
A map f : X → Y inducing an isomorphism of πk X → πk Y for all k is called a weak homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
Thus a map inducing a homology isomorphism between simply connected spaces is a weak homotopy equivalence. Conversely a weak homotopy equivalence between two spaces gives a homology isomorphism.

We will see later (Theorem 7.34) that if X, Y are CW-complexes, then f : X → Y is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if f is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
Corollary 6.70. A continuous map f : X → Y between simply connected CW-complexes inducing an isomorphism on all Z-homology groups is a homotopy equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
This corollary does not imply that if X, Y are two simply connected spaces with the same homology, then they are homotopy equivalent; one needs a map inducing the homology equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
For example, X = S 4 ∨ (S 2 × S 2 ) and Y = CP 2 ∨ CP 2 are simply connected spaces with the same homology. They are not homotopy equivalent because their cohomology rings are diﬀerent.

Recall from Shapiro’s lemma (Exercise 75) that Hk (X ̃ X̃; Z) ∼ = ∼ = Hk (X, Z[π1 X]) for all k (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 178</a>)</p>
The Whitehead theorem for non-simply connected spaces involves homology with local coeﬃcients: If f : X → Y is a map, let f˜ : X̃ → Ỹ be the corresponding lift to universal covers.

and πk ̃ X̃ ∼ = ∼ = πk X for k > 1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=179" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 179</a>)</p>
Theorem 6.71. If f : X → Y induces an isomorphism f∗ : π1 X → π1 Y , then f is n-connected if and only if it induces isomorphisms Hk (X; Z[π]) → Hk (Y ; Z[π]) for k < n and an epimorphism Hn (X; Z[π]) → Hn (Y ; Z[π]) In particular, f is a weak homotopy equivalence (homotopy equivalence if X, Y are CW-complexes) if only if f∗ : Hk (X; Aρ ) → Hk (Y ; Aρ ) is an isomorphism for all local coeﬃcient systems ρ : π → Aut(A). Thus, in the presence of a map f : X → Y , homotopy equivalences can be detected by homology.

6.18.1. The Hurewicz theorem. The statement is given in Theorem 6.66. A reference is §IV.4-IV.7 in [43]. Another possibility is to give a spectral sequence proof.

Obstruction theory addresses the following types of problems (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=180" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 180</a>)</p>
Fibrations and coﬁbrations are easier to work with than arbitrary maps since they have ﬁbers and coﬁbers (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=181" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 181</a>)</p>
Then the following exercise is an easy consequence of the homotopy lifting property, the homotopy extension property, and the method of turning maps into ﬁbrations or coﬁbrations. Exercise 116. Each of the four problems stated above is solvable for arbitrary continuous maps g : A → X and p : E → B between CW-complexes if and only if it is solvable for the CW-pair (Mh , A) and the ﬁbration Pp → E.

Exercise 117. (Motivating exercise of obstruction theory) Any map f : X → Y from an n-dimensional CW-complex to an n-connected space is null-homotopic.

It turns out that if Y is only assumed to be (n − 1)-connected there is a single obstruction θ(f ) ∈ H n (X; πn Y ) which vanishes if and only if the map f is null-homotopic. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/James Davis, Paul Kirk/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology (696)/Lecture Notes in Algebraic Topology - James Davis, Paul Kirk.pdf#page=182" target="_blank">James Davis, Paul Kirk 182</a>)</p>
In this way we obtain a cellular cochain which assigns to e n+1 ∈ X the element in πn Y . If this cochain is the zero cochain, then the map can be extended over the (n + 1)-skeleton of X. It turns out this cochain is in fact a cocycle and so represents a cohomology class in H n+1 (X; πn Y ). The remarkable result is that if this cocycle represents the zero cohomology class, then by redeﬁning the map on the n-skeleton one can then extend it over the (n + 1)-skeleton of X (if you take one step backwards, then you will be able to take two steps forward).

This suggests one could deﬁne H n (X; A) to be [X, K(A, n)].

I was immediately intrigued by this surprising connection between homological algebra and geometry (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=3" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 3</a>)</p>
If you play around with some simple examples, an idea for defining intersection multiplicities comes up naturally. It is i(Z, W ; P ) = dim C h C [x1 , . . . , xn ]/(f1 , . . . , fk , g1 , . . . , gl ) i P (1.1) i(Z, W ; P ) = dimC C[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(f1 , . . . , fk , g1 , . . . , gl ) . Here the subscript P indicates localization of the given ring at the maximal ideal (x1 − p1 , . . . , xn − pn ) where P = (p1 , . . . , pn ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=5" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 5</a>)</p>
Example 1.2. Let f = y − x2 and g = y. This is our example of the parabola and the tangent line at its vertex. The point P = (0, 0) is the only intersection point, and our definition tells us to look at the ring C [x, y]/(y − x 2 , y) ∼ = ∼ = C[x]/(x 2 ). As a vector space over C this is two-dimensional, with basis 1 and x. So our definition gives i(Z, W ; P ) = 2 as desired. [Note that technically we should localize at the ideal (x, y), which corresponds to localization at (x) in C [x]/(x 2 ); however, this ring is already local and so the localization has no effect] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=5" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 5</a>)</p>
Note the appearance of (x − 1) with multiplicity two in the above factorization. The fact that we had a tangent line at x = 1 guaranteed that the multiplicity would be strictly larger than one (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 6</a>)</p>
Serre discovered the correct formula for the interesection multiplicity [S]. His formula is as follows. If we set R = C [x1 , . . . , xn ] then i(Z, W ; P ) = ∞ X j=0 (−1) j dim h Tor R j  R/(f1 , . . . , fk ), R/(g1 , . . . , g l ) i P .

An algebraist who looks at (1.5) will immediately notice some possible generalizations. The R/(f ) and R/(g) terms can be replaced by any finitely-generated module M and N , as long as the Torj (M, N ) modules are finite-dimensional over C . For this it turns out to be enough that M ⊗R N be finite-dimensional over C . Also, we can replace C [x1 , . . . , xn ] with any ring having the property that all finitely-generated modules have finite projective dimension—necessary so that the alternating sum of (1.5) is finite. Such rings are called regular. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=7" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 7</a>)</p>
Let R be a regular, local ring (all rings are assumed to be commutative and Noetherian unless otherwise noted). Let M and N be finitely-generated modules over R such that M ⊗R N has finite length. This implies that all the Torj (M, N ) modules also have finite length. Define e(M, N ) = ∞ X j=0 (−1) j X (−1)j ` Torj (M, N )  (1.6) e(M, N ) = and call this the intersection multiplicty of the modules M and N . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 8</a>)</p>
Based on geometric intuition, Serre made the following conjectures about the above situation: (1) dim M + dim N ≤ dim R always (2) e(M, N ) ≥ 0 always (3) If dim M + dim N < dim R then e(M, N ) = 0. (4) If dim M + dim N = dim R then e(M, N ) > 0. Serre proved all of these in the case that R contains a field, the so-called “geometric case” (some non-geometric examples for R include power series rings over the padic integers Zp ). Serre also proved (1) in general. Conjecture (3) was proven in the mid 80s by Roberts and Gillet-Soule (independently), using some sophisticated topological ideas that were imported into algebra. Conjecture (2) was proven by Gabber in the mid 90s, using some high-tech algebraic geometry. Conjecture (4) is still open.

There are certain generalized cohomology theories—called complex-oriented — which have a close connection to geometry and intersection theory. Any such cohomology can be used to detect intersection multiplicities.

Topological K-theory is a complex-oriented cohomology theory. Elements of the groups K ∗ (X) are specified by vector bundles on X, or more generally by bounded chain complexes of vector bundles on X. Fundamental classes for complex submanifolds of X are given by resolutions. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 8</a>)</p>
When X is an algebraic variety there is another version of K-theory called algebraic K-theory, which we might denote K ∗ alg (X). The analogs of vector bundles are locally free coherent sheaves, or just finitely-generated projective modules when X is affine. Thus, in the affine case elements of K ∗ alg (X) can be specified by bounded chain complexes of finitely-generated projective modules. This is the main connection between homological algebra and K-theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 8</a>)</p>

(4) Serre’s definition of intersection multiplicities essentially comes from the intersection product in K-homology, which is the cup product in K-cohomology translated to homology via Poincaré Duality.

Theorem 2.1 (Hilbert Syzygy Theorem). Let k be a field and let R be k[x1 , . . . , xn ] (or any localization of this ring). Then every finitely-generated R-module has a free resolution of length at most n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 10</a>)</p>
We mention it here because it implies that Torj (M, N ) = 0 for j > n. Therefore the sum in Serre’s formula is actually finite. More generally, a ring is called regular if every finitely-generated module has a finite, projective resolution. It is a theorem that localizations of regular rings are again regular. Hilbert’s Syzygy Theorem simply says that polynomial rings over a field are regular.

The importance of this observation is that it tells us that the Tor’s in Serre’s formula may all be taken over the ring RP . So we might as well work over this ring from beginning to end (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 10</a>)</p>
Lemma 2.2. Suppose that 0 → M 0 → M → M 00 → 0 is a short exact sequence of R-modules. Then e(M, N ) = e(M 0 , N )+e(M 00 , N ), assuming all three multiplicities are defined (that is, under the assumption that dim C (M ⊗ N ) < ∞ and similarly with M replaced by M 0 and M 00 ).

Lemma 2.2 is referred to as the additivity of intersection multiplicities. Of course the additivity holds equally well in the second variable, by the same argument. While exploring ideas in this general area, Grothendieck hit upon the idea of inventing a group that captures all the additive invariants of modules. Any invariant such as e(−, N ) would then factor through this group. Here is the definition: Definition 2.3. Let R be any ring. Let F(R) be the free abelian group with one generator [M ] for every isomorphism class of finitely-generated R-module M . Let G(R) be the quotient of F(R) by the subgroup generated by all elements [M ] − [M 0 ] − [M 00 ] for every short exact sequence 0 → M 0 → M → M 00 → 0 of finitely-generated Rmodules. The group G(R) is called the Grothendieck group of finitely-generated R-modules. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=11" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 11</a>)</p>
1) Suppose R = F , a field. Clearly G(F ) is generated by [F ], since every finitelygenerated F -module has the form F n (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 12</a>)</p>
More generally, suppose that R is a domain. The rank of an R-module M is defined to be the dimension of M ⊗R QF (R) over QF (R), where QF (R) is the quotient field. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 12</a>)</p>
Let G be a finite group, and let R = C [G] be the group algebra. So R-modules are just representations of G on complex vector spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 12</a>)</p>
For a not-so-simple example, let R be the ring of integers in a number field. It turns out that G(R) ∼ = ∼ = Z ⊕ Cl(R), where Cl(R) is the ideal class group of R. This class group contains some sophisticated number-theoretic information about R. It is known to always be torsion, and it is usually nontrivial.

All finitely-generated R-modules have a finite composition series, and so we can take the Jordan-Hölder length; this is the same as `(A) = dim Z/p A/pA + dim Z/p pA. With some trouble one can check that this is indeed an additive invariant (or refer to the Jordan-Hölder theorem), and of course `( Z /p) = 1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 13</a>)</p>
Definition 2.7. Let R be any ring. Let FK (R) be the free abelian group with one generator [P ] for every isomorphism class of finitely-generated, projective Rmodule M . Let K(R) be the quotient of FK (R) by the subgroup generated by all elements [P ] − [P 0 ] − [P 00 ] for every short exact sequence 0 → P 0 → P → P 00 → 0 of finitely-generated projectives. The group K(R) is called the Grothendieck group of finitely-generated projective modules. Every short exact sequence of projectives is actually split, so we could also have defined K(R) by imposing the relations [P ⊕ Q] = [P ] + [Q] for every two finitelygenerated projectives P and Q. This makes it a little easier to understand when two modules represent the same class in K(R (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 13</a>)</p>
Proposition 2.8. Let P and Q be finitely-generated projective R-modules. Then [P ] = [Q] in K(R) if and only if there exists a finitely-generated projective module W such that P ⊕ W ∼ = ∼ = Q ⊕ W . In fact, the same remains true if we require W to be free instead of projective. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 14</a>)</p>
For the last statement in the proposition, just observe that since W is projective it is a direct summand of a free module. That is, there exists a module W 0 such that W ⊕W 0 is finitely-genereated and free (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 14</a>)</p>
Since projective modules are flat, the product [P ]·[Q] = [P ⊗R Q] is additive and so extends to a product K(R)⊗K(R) → K(R).

Remark 2.9. Given the motivation of having the tensor product give a ring structure, one might wonder why we used projective modules to define K(R) rather than flat modules. We could have done so, but for finitely-generated modules over commutative, Noetherian rings, being flat and projective are equivalent notions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 14</a>)</p>

For any ring R, we have the group K(R) which also comes to us with an easily-defined ring structure ⊗. We also have the group G(R)—but this does not have any evident ring structure. When R is regular, there is an isomorphism K(R) → G(R) which allows one to transplant the ring structure from K(R) onto G(R): and this leads us directly to our alternating-sum-of-Tors (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 16</a>)</p>
from K(R) onto G(R): and this leads us directly to our alternating-sum-of-Tors. This situation is very reminiscent of something you have seen in a basic algebraic topology course. When X is a (compact, oriented) manifold, there were early attempts to put a ring structure on H∗ (X) coming from the intersection product. This is technically very difficult. In modern times one avoids these technicalities by instead introducing the cohomology groups H ∗ (X), and here it is easy to define a ring structure: the cup product. When X is a compact, oriented manifold one has the Poincaré Duality isomorphism H ∗ (X) → H∗ (X) given by capping with the fundamental class, and this lets one transplant the cup product onto H∗ (X). This is the modern approach to intersection theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 16</a>)</p>
The parallels here are intriguing: K(R) is somehow like H ∗ (X), and G(R) is somehow like H∗ (X). The regularity condition is like being a manifold.

[The reader might wonder what happened to the assumptions of compactness and orientability. Neither of these is really needed for Poincaré Duality, as long as one does things correctly. For the version of Poincaré Duality for noncompact manifolds one needs to replace ordinary homology with Borel-Moore homology—this is similar to singular homology, but chains are permitted to have infinitely many terms if they stretch out to infinity. For non-orientable manifolds one needs to use twisted coefficients (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 16</a>)</p>

Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz says that points of C n are in bijective correspondence with maximal ideals in R: the bijection sends q = (q1 , . . . , qn ) to mq = (x1 −q1 , . . . , xn −qn ). With a little work one can generalize this bijection. If S ⊆ C n is any subset, define I(S) = {f ∈ R | f (x) = 0 for all x ∈ S}. This is an ideal in R, in fact a radical ideal (meaning that if f n ∈ I(S) then f ∈ I(S)). In the other direction, if I ⊆ R is any ideal then define V (I) = {x ∈ C n | f (x) = 0 for all f ∈ I}. Notice that V (mq ) = {q} and I({q}) = mq . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 17</a>)</p>
An algebraic set in C n is any subset of the form V (I) for some ideal I ⊆ R. The algebraic sets form the closed sets for a topology on C n , called the Zariski topology. One form of the Nullstellensatz says that V and I give a bijection between algebraic sets and radical ideals in R. Under this bijection the prime ideals correspond to irreducible algebraic sets—ones that cannot be written as X ∪ Y where both X and Y are proper closed subsets. Algebraic sets are also called algebraic subvarieties. The above discussion is summarized in the following table: Geometry Algebra C n or An nC nC C [x1 , . . . , xn ] = R Points (q1 , . . . , qn ) Maximal ideals (x1 − q1 , . . . , xn − qn ) Algebraic sets Radical ideals Irreducible algebraic sets Prime ideals (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 17</a>)</p>
The ring R is best thought of as the set of maps of varieties A n → A 1 , with pointwise addition and multiplication. If we restrict to some irreducible subvariety X = V (P ) ⊆ A n instead, then the ring of functions X → A 1 is R/P . This ring of functions is commonly called the coordinate ring of X. Much of the dictionary between A n and R discussed above adapts verbatim to give a dictionary between X and its coordinate ring: Geometry Algebra X = V (P ) C [x1 , . . . , xn ]/P = R/P Points in X Maximal ideals in R/P Algebraic subsets V (I) ⊆ X Radical ideals in R/P Irreducible algebraic sets V (Q) ⊆ X Prime ideals in R/P . Note that ideals in R/P correspond bijectively to ideals in R containing P , and likewise for prime (respectively, radical) ideals.

We need one last observation. Passing from A n to A n+1 corresponds algebraically to passing from R to R[t]. If X = V (P ) ⊆ A n is an irreducible algebraic set, then X × A 1 ⊆ A n+1 is V (P [t]) where P [t] ⊆ R[t]. That is, the coordinate ring of X is R/P and the coordinate ring of X × A 1 is R[t]/P [t] = (R/P )[t]. We supplement our earlier tables with the following line: Geometry Algebra X X × A 1 S S[t] We have defined G(−) and K(−) as functors taking rings as their inputs, but we could also think of them as taking varieties (or schemes) as their inputs (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 17</a>)</p>
Theorem 2.15. If R is Noetherian, the Grothendieck group G(R) is generated by the set of elements [R/P ] where P ⊆R is prime. Before proving this result let us comment on the significance. When X is a topological space, the groups H∗ (X) have a geometric presentation in terms of “cycles” and “homologies”. The cycles are, of course, generators for the group. The definition of G(R) doesn’t look anything like this, but Theorem 2.15 says that the group is indeed generated by classes that have the feeling of “algebraic cycles” on the variety Spec R (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 18</a>)</p>
It is worth pointing out that in H∗ (X) the cycles are strictly separated by dimension—the dimensions i cycles are confined to the single group Hi (X)—whereas in G(R) the cycles of different dimensions are all inhabiting the same group. This is one of the main differences between K-theory and singular homology/cohomology.

Lemma 2.16. Let R be a Noetherian ring. For any finitely-generated R-module M , there exists a prime ideal P ⊆R and an embedding R/P ,→ M . Equivalently, there is some z∈M whose annihilator is prime.

If M is an R-module, write M [t] for the R[t]-module M ⊗R R[t]. The functor M→ 7 M [t] is exact, because R[t] is flat over R (in fact, it is even free). So we have an induced map α : G(R) → G(R[t]) given by [M ] 7→ [M [t]]. Theorem 2.18 (Homotopy invariance). If R is Noetherian, α : G(R) → G(R[t]) is an isomorphism. We comment on the name “homotopy invariance” for the above result. If X = Spec R then Spec R[t] = X × A 1 , so the result says that G(−) gives the same values on X and X × A 1 . This is reminiscent of a functor on topological spaces giving the same values on X and X × I.

Recall that a module is projective if and only if it is a direct summand of a free module. So free modules are projective, and for almost all applications in homological algebra one can get by with using only free modules. Consequently, it is common not to know many examples of non-free projectives. We begin this section by remedying this.

This example generalizes: if D is a Dedekind domain (such as the ring of integers in an algebraic number field) then every ideal I ⊆ D is projective. Non-principal ideals are never free.

Let R = R [x, y, z]/(x 2 + y 2 + z 2 − 1). If C(S 2 ) denotes the ring of continuous functions S 2 → R , note that we may regard R as sitting inside of C(S 2 ): it is the subring of polynomial functions on the 2-sphere. The connections with the topology of the 2-sphere will be important below. Let π : R 3 → R be the map  π(f, g,h) = xf + yg + zh. That is, π is leftmultiplication by the matrix x y z .

The map π is split via χ : R → R3 sending 1 7→ (x, y, z). We conclude that T ⊕R ∼ = ∼ = R 3 , so T is projective.

Note that T is, in some sense, an algebraic analog of the tangent bundle of S 2 .

This example is based on the Möbius bundle over S 1 . Let S = R [x, y]/(x 2 + y 2 − 1) and let R ⊆ S be the span of the even degree monomials. One should regard S as the ring of polynomial functions on the circle, and R is the ring of polynomial functions f (x, y) satisfying f (x, y) = f (−x, −y). So R is trying to be the ring of polynomial functions on R P 1 (which happens to be homeomorphic to S 1 ).

Define the reduced Grothendieck group of R to be K e K(R) e = K(R)/h[R]i. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 22</a>)</p>
In the 1950s, Serre conjectured that every finitely-generated projective over F [x1 , . . . , xn ] is actually free. As we will see later (Remark 11.5 below), the motivation for this conjecture is inspired by topology and the connection between vector bundles and projective modules. Quillen and Suslin independently proved Serre’s conjecture in the 1970s.

Proposition 3.1. Let R be a commutative ring. The following are equivalent: (1) K(R) ∼ = ∼ =Z (2) K e K(R) = 0 e (3) Every finitely-generated, projective R-module is stably-free.

Remark 4.3. Theorem 4.1 gives another parallel between G(−) and singular homology. If X = Spec R then A = Spec R/f is a closed subscheme, and Spec f −1 R = X − A is the open complement (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 24</a>)</p>
So the sequence in Theorem 4.1 can be written as G(A) → G(X) → G(X − A) → 0. This is somewhat reminiscent of the long exact sequence in singular homology · · · → H∗ (A) → H∗ (X) → H∗ (X, A) → · · · (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 24</a>)</p>
The second thing is to recall something you probably learned in a basic algebra class, namely the Jordan-Hölder Theorem. This says that given any two filtrations of M we can refine each one so that the two refinements have the same quotients up to reindexing.

Definition 5.2. A map of chain complexes C• → D• is a quasi-isomorphism if the induced maps Hi (C• ) → Hi (D• ) are isomorphisms for all i ∈ Z.

Lemma 5.3. If P and Q are bounded below complexes of projectives, then every quasi-isomorphism is a chain homotopy equivalence.

This lemma lets us replace the words “chain homotopy equivalence” with “quasiisomorphism” in any statement about bounded, projective complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 30</a>)</p>
). The advantage of doing this is simply that quasi-isomorphisms are somewhat easier to identify than chain homotopy equivalences.

why complicate things by making the defintion using complexes of arbitrary length? The answer comes from algebraic geometry. Let X be a scheme and let U be an open subset of X. Then the ‘correct’ way to define a relative K-theory group K(X, U ) is to use bounded chain complexes of locally free sheaves on X that are exact on U . When X = Spec R and U = Spec S −1 R then it happens that one can get the same groups using only complexes of length one—as we saw above. But even for X = Spec R not every open subset is of this form. A general subset will have the form U = (Spec S −1 R) ∪ (Spec S −1 R) ∪ · · · ∪ (Spec S −1 R), but to get the same relative K-group here one must use complexes of length at most d (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=34" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 34</a>)</p>

Let R be a Noetherian ring, and let Z ⊆ Spec R be a Zariski closed set. Recall that an R-module M is said to be supported on Z if MP = 0 for all primes P ∈ / Z.

The quotient of P 6=0 Z by the classes div(x) is called the divisor class group of D; it is isomorphic to the ideal class group from algebraic number theory.

Our next goal in these notes is to explore the idea of doing linear algebra locally over a fixed base space X. To be slightly more precise, our objects of interest will be maps of spaces E → X where the fibers carry the structure of vector spaces; a map from E → X to E 0 → X is a continuous map F : E → E 0 , commuting with the maps down to X, such that F is a linear transformation on each fiber. It turns out that much of linear algebra carries over easily to this enhanced setting. But there are more isomorphism types of objects here, because the topology of X allows for some twisting in the vector space structure of the fibers. The surprise is that studying these ‘twisted vector spaces’ over a base space X quickly leads to interesting homotopy invariants of X! Topological K-theory is a cohomology theory for topological spaces that arises out of this study of fibrewise linear algebra (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=50" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 50</a>)</p>
Definition 8.1. A family of (real) vector spaces is a map p : E → X together with operations + : E ×X E → E and · : R × E → E making the two diagrams E ×X E HH H$ H H H H H H H E H + E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ R × EF · F# F F F F F F F /E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ X X commute, and such that the operations make each fiber p −1 (x) into a real vector space over X. One could write down the above definition completely category-theoretically, in terms of maps and commutative diagrams. Essentially one is defining a “vector space object” in the category of spaces over X.

notion is too wild to be of much use: there are too many ‘crazy’ families of vector spaces like this one. One fixes this by adding a condition that forces the fibers to vary continuously, in a certain sense. This is done as follows: Definition 8.3. A vector bundle is a family of vector spaces p : E → X such that for each x ∈ X there is a neighborhood x ∈ U ⊆ X, an n ∈ Z≥0 , and an isomorphism of families of vector spaces p −1 (U ) F # F F F F F F F ∼ = ∼ = / U × R n w{ w w w w w w w w U Usually one simply says that a vector bundle is a family of vector spaces that is locally trivial. The isomorphism in the above diagram is called a “local trivialization”.

The family of vector spaces from Example 8.2(c) perhaps makes it clear that this notion is too wild to be of much use: there are too many ‘crazy’ families of vector (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 51</a>)</p>
Let X = R . Let e1 , e2 be the standard basis for R 2 . Let E ⊆ X × R 2 be the union of {(x, re1 ) | x ∈ Q, r ∈ R} and {(x, re2 ) | x ∈ X\Q, r ∈ R}. Recall from (a) that X × R 2 → X is a family of vector spaces, and note that E becomes a sub-family of vector spaces under the same operations.

Remark 8.4. Note that the n appearing in Definition 8.3 depends on the point x. It is called the rank of the vector bundle at x, and denoted rankx (E). It is easy to prove that the rank is constant on the connected components of X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 51</a>)</p>
Notation 8.5. If p : E → X is a family of vector spaces and A ,→ X is a subspace, then p −1 (A) → A is also a family of vector spaces. We will usually write this restriction as E|A . Note that if E is a vector bundle then so is E|A , by a simple argument. The construction E|A is a special case of a pullback bundle, which we will discuss in Section 8.9. Of the families of vector spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=51" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 51</a>)</p>
we considered in Example 8.2, only the trivial family from (a) is a vector bundle. Before discussing more interesting examples, it will be useful to have a mechanism for deciding when a family of vector spaces is trivial. If p : E → X is a family of vector spaces, a section of p is a map s : X → E such that ps = id. The set of sections is denoted Γ(E), and this becomes a vector space using pointwise addition and multiplication in the fibers of E. A collection of sections s1 , . . . , sr is linearly independent if the vectors s1 (x), s2 (x), . . . , sr (x) are linearly independent in Ex for every x ∈ X.

Proposition 8.6. Let E → X be a family of vector spaces of constant rank n. Then the family is trivial if and only if there is a linearly independent collection of sections s1 , s2 , . . . , sn .

(a) Let φ : R n → R n be a vector space isomorphism. Let E 0 = [0, 1] × R n and let E be the quotient of E 0 by the relation (0, v) ∼ (1, φ(v)). Identifying S 1 with the quotient of [0, 1] by 0 ∼ 1, we obtain a map E → S 1 that is clearly a family of vector spaces. We claim this is a vector bundle. If x ∈ (0, 1) then it is evident that E is locally trivial at x, so the only point of concern is x = 0 = 1 ∈ S 1 . Let e1 , . . . , en be the standard basis for R n , and let si : [0, 41 41 ] → E 0 be the constant section whose value is ei . Likewise, let s0 i i : ( 4 , 1] → E 0 be the constant section whose value is φ(ei ). Projecting into E we obtain si (0) = s 0i (1), and so the sections si and s0 i patch together to give a section Si : U → E, where U = [0, 41 1 ) ∪ ( 34 , 1]. The sections S1 , . . . , Sn are independent and therefore give a local trivialization of E over U . When n = 1 and φ(x) = −x the resulting bundle is the Möbius bundle M , depicted below: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=52" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 52</a>)</p>
Let X = R P n , and let L ⊆ X × R n+1 be the set L = {(l, v) | l ∈ R P n , x ∈ l}. Then L is a subfamily of the trivial family, and we claim that it is a line bundle over X. To see this, for any l ∈ X we must produce a local trivialization. By symmetry it suffices to do this when l = he1 i. Let U ⊆ RP n be the set of lines whose orthogonal projection to he1 i is nonzero. Such a line contains a unique vector of the form e1 + u where e1 · u = 0. Define s : U → L by sending l to (l, e1 + u) where e1 + u is the unique point on l described above. This section is clearly nonzero everywhere, so it gives a trivialization of L|U . Thus, we have proven that L is locally trivial and hence a vector bundle. The bundle L is called the tautological line bundle over R P n . Do not confuse this with the canonical line bundle over R P n that we will define shortly (they are duals of each other). Note that when n = 1 the bundle L is isomorphic to the Möbius bundle on S 1 .

Projection to the first coordinate π : η → Grk (V ) makes η into a rank k vector bundle, called the tautological bundle over Grk (V ).

Pullback bundles can be slightly non-intuitive. Let M → S 1 be the Möbius bundle, and let f : S 1 → S 1 be the map z 7→ z 2 . We claim that f ∗ M ∼ = 1. This is easiest to see if one uses the following model for M : M = n e iθ , re i θ θ 2 θ ∈ [0, 2π], r ∈ R o (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=53" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 53</a>)</p>
We may form a new bundle E ⊕ E 0 , whose underlying topological space is just the pullback E ×X E 0 . So a point in E ⊕ F is a pair (e, e0 ) where p(e) = p0 (e0 ). The rules for vector addition and scalar multiplication are the evident ones. Note that the fiber of E ⊕ E 0 over a point x is simply Ex ⊕ Ex0 .

More generally, any canonical construction one can apply to vector spaces may be extended to apply to vector bundles. So one can talk about the bundles E ⊗ E 0 , the dual bundle E ∗ , the hom-bundle Hom(E, E 0 ), the exterior product bundle /\ i E, and so on (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 54</a>)</p>
Recall that if fA : A → Y and fB : B → Y are continuous maps that agree on A ∩ B then we may patch these together to get a continuous map f : X → Y provided that either (i) A and B are both closed, or (ii) A and B are both open. This is a basic fact about topological spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=55" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 55</a>)</p>
closed, or (ii) A and B are both open. This is a basic fact about topological spaces. The analogous facts for vector bundles are very similar in the case of an open cover, but more subtle for closed covers. Proposition 8.15. Let E → X be a family of vector spaces. (a) If {Uα } is an open cover of X and each E|Uα is a vector bundle, then E is a vector bundle. (b) Suppose {A, B} is a cover of X by closed subspaces, and that for every x ∈ A∩B and every open neighborhood x ∈ U ⊆ X there exists a neighborhood x ∈ V ⊆ U such that V ∩ A ∩ B ,→ V ∩ B has a retraction. Then if E|A and E|B are both vector bundles, so is E.

(ii) The two isomorphisms φγ,α and φγ,β ◦ φβ,α agree on their common domain of definition, which is Eα |Uα ∩Uβ ∩Uγ .

Condition (ii) above is usually called the cocycle condition. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=56" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 56</a>)</p>
To see why, consider the case where all of the Eα ’s are trivial bundles of rank n. Then the data in the φα,β maps is really just the data of a map gα,β : Uα ∩ Uβ → GLn (R). These (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=56" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 56</a>)</p>

Condition (ii) is the requirement that the transition functions assemble to give a C Č Čech 1-cocycle with values in the group GLn (R) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 57</a>)</p>
We will see in a moment (Corollary 8.23) that for real vector bundles over paracompact Hausdorff spaces one always has E ∼ = ∼ = E ∗ , although the isomorphism is not canonical. This is not true for complex or quaternionic bundles, however (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 57</a>)</p>
Let L → C P n be the tautological complex line bundle over C P n . Its (complex) dual L ∗ is called the canonical line bundle over C P n .

Whereas from a topological standpoint neither L nor L ∗ holds a preferential position over the other, in algebraic geometry there is an important difference between the two. The difference comes from the fact that L ∗ has certain “naturally defined” sections, whereas L does not (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 57</a>)</p>
For a point z = [z0 : · · · : zn ] ∈ CP n , Lz is the complex line in C n+1 spanned by (z0 , . . . , zn ). Given only z ∈ CP n there is no evident way of writing down a point on Lz , without making some kind of arbitrary choice; said differently, the bundle L does not have any easily-described sections. In contrast, it is much easier to write down a functional on Lz . For example, let φi be the unique functional on Lz that sends the point (z0 , . . . , zn ) to zi . Notice that this description depends only on z ∈ C P n , not the point (z0 , . . . , zn ) ∈ Cn+1 that represents it; that is, the functional sending (λz0 , . . . , λzn ) to λzi is the same as φi . In this way we obtain an entire C n+1 ’s worth of sections for L ∗ , by taking linear combinations of the φi ’s.

To be clear, it is important to realize that L has plenty of sections—it is just that one cannot describe them by simple formulas. The slogan to remember is that the bundle L ∗ has algebraic sections, whereas L does not. In algebraic geometry the bundle L ∗ is usually denoted O(1), whereas L is denoted O(−1). More generally, O(n) denotes (L∗ )⊗n when n ≥ 0 (so that O(0) is the trivial line bundle), and denotes L ⊗(−n) when n < 0 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=57" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 57</a>)</p>
Definition 8.21. Let E → X be a real vector bundle. An inner product on E is a map of vector bundles E ⊗ E → 1 that induces a positive-definite, symmetric, bilinear form on each fiber Ex . A vector bundle with an inner product is usually called an orthogonal vector bundle.

Now consider the fibration sequence On ,→ GLn (R) → GLn (R)/On . The projection map sends a matrix P to P In P T = P P T . The inclusion On ,→ GLn (R) is a homotopy equivalence by Gram-Schmidt, and so GLn (R)/On is weakly contractible. Standard techniques show that this homogeneous space may be given the structure of a CW-complex (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 59</a>)</p>
Suppose that E → X is a rank n real vector bundle with an inner product. Choose a trivializing open cover {Uα }, and for each α fix an inner-productpreserving trivialization fα : E|Uα → Uα × Rn where the codomain has the standard inner product (this is possible by Proposition 8.25). The transition functions gα,β : Uα ∩ Uβ → GLn (R) therefore factor through On , as they must preserve the inner product. This process is usually referred to as reduction of the structure group.

We claim that the projection map p1 : Z → W is a fiber bundle with fiber Rk(n−k) , but defer the proof for just a moment.

Proposition 9.5. Suppose that X is compact and Hausdorff. Then every bundle is a subbundle of some trivial bundle.

Lemma 9.7. Let E α α −→ F β −→ G be an exact sequence of vector bundles. Then im α (which equals ker β) is a vector bundle.

In this section we explore our first connection between topology and algebra. We will see that vector bundles are closely related to projective modules.

The assignment E 7→ Γ(E) gives a functor from vector bundles to C(X)-modules. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=64" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 64</a>)</p>
When X is a space let C(X) denote the ring of continuous functions from X to R , where the addition and multiplication are pointwise (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=64" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 64</a>)</p>
It is easy to check that Γ is a left-exact functor (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=64" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 64</a>)</p>
If E → X is a vector bundle then of course the modules of the form Γ(E) are not just arbitrary C(X)-modules; there is something special about them. It is easiest to say what this is under some assumptions on X: Proposition 10.1. If X is compact and Hausdorff, and E is a vector bundle over X, then Γ(E) if a finitely-generated, projective module over C(X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=64" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 64</a>)</p>
That is, Γ(E) is a direct summand of a free module; hence it is projective. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=64" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 64</a>)</p>
For the rest of this section we will assume that our base spaces are compact and Hausdorff. Let hhVect(X)ii denote the category of vector bundles over X, and let hhMod −C(X)ii denote the category of modules over the ring C(X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=64" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 64</a>)</p>
hhProj −C(X)ii denote the full subcategory of finitely-generated, projective modules. Then Γ is a functor hhVect(X)ii → hhProj −C(X)ii. It is proven in [Sw] that this is actually an equivalence: Theorem 10.2 (Swan’s Theorem). Let X be a compact, Hausdorff space. Then Γ : hhVect(X)ii → hhProj −C(X)ii is an equivalence of categories. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 65</a>)</p>
To prove this result we need to verify two things: • Every finitely-generated projective over C(X) is isomorphic to Γ(E) for some vector bundle E. • For every two vector bundles E and F , the induced map Γ : HomVect(X) (E, F ) → HomC(X) (ΓE, ΓF ) is a bijection. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 65</a>)</p>
That is to say, we need to prove that Γ is surjective on isomorphism classes, and is fully faithful (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=65" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 65</a>)</p>
Note that we have the evaluation map evx : Γ(E) → Ex . This map clearly sends the submodule mx Γ(E) to zero. Lemma 10.4. Assume that X is paracompact Hausdorff. Then for any vector bundle E → X and any x ∈ X, the map evx : Γ(E)/mx Γ(E) ∼ = ∼ = = −→ Ex is an isomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=66" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 66</a>)</p>
Our final goal is to prove that Γ is fully faithful. To do this, it is useful to relate the fibers Ex of our bundle to an algebraic construction based on the module Γ(E). For each x ∈ X consider the evaluation map evx : C(X) → R, and let mx be the kernel. The ideal mx ⊆ C(X) is maximal, since the quotient is a field. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=66" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 66</a>)</p>
Proposition 10.5. Assume that X is paracompact Hausdorff. Then for any vector bundles E and F over X, the map Γ : HomVect(X) (E, F ) → HomC(X) (ΓE, ΓF ) is a bijection. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=66" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 66</a>)</p>
For a fixed n, let Vectn (X) denote the set of isomorphism classes of vector bundles on X. It turns out that when X is a finite complex this set is always countable, and often finite. It actually gives a homotopy invariant of the space X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=67" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 67</a>)</p>
Example 11.3. To give an idea how we will apply these results, let us think about vector bundles on S 1 . Divide S 1 into an upper hemisphere D+ and a lower hemisphere D− , intersecting in two points. Each of D+ and D− are contractible, so any vector bundle will be trivializable when restricted to these subspaces. Given two elements α, β ∈ GLn (R), let En (α, β) be the vector bundle on S 1 obtained by taking n D+ and n D− and gluing them together via α and β at the two points on the equator. The considerations of the previous paragraph tell us that every vector bundle on S 1 is of this form (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=68" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 68</a>)</p>
In (2) we have used the fact that π0 (GLn (R)) = Z/2, with the isomorphism being given by the sign of the determinant. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=68" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 68</a>)</p>
To summarize, from (1) and (2) it follows that isomorphism types for rank n bundles over S 1 are in bijective correspondence with the path components of GLn (R). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=69" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 69</a>)</p>
The methods of the above example apply in much greater generality, and with little change allow one to get control over vector bundles on any suspension. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=69" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 69</a>)</p>
Remark 11.5. We have seen that all bundles on contractible spaces are trivial, and that there is a close connection between vector bundles and projective modules. Recall that when k is a field then k[x1 , . . . , xn ] is the algebraic analog of affine space A n , and that projectives over this ring correspond to algebraic vector bundles. The analogy with topology is what led Serre to conjecture that all finitely-generated projectives over k[x1 , . . . , xn ] are free (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 70</a>)</p>
We have proven that if E is a vector bundle on X × I then i∗0 (E) ∼ = ∼ i = ∗ 1 (E). It is natural to wonder if this result has a converse, but stating such a thing is somewhat tricky (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 70</a>)</p>
So we find ourselves in somewhat of a muddle. Perhaps there is an interesting question here, but we don’t quite know how to ask it. One approach is to restrict to a class of bundles where “equality” is something we can better control (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=70" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 70</a>)</p>
We may view a vector bundle as a family of vector spaces indexed by the base space. In general, we may view a map X → Y as a family of blah if each fiber is a blah. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 71</a>)</p>
We naively hope that families of some mathematical object over X are in bijection with maps from X to some space, called the moduli space corresponding to that mathematical object. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 71</a>)</p>
some space, called the moduli space corresponding to that mathematical object. With this naive idea, we would hope that families over ∗ are in bijective correspondence with points of our moduli space. However, this does not work since the moduli space of R n ’s is ∗. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 71</a>)</p>
V ⊆ W then we get an induced inclusion of Grassmannians Grk (V ) ,→ Grk (W ). Consider the standard chain of inclusions of Euclidean spaces R k , and define the infinite Grassmannian Grn (R ∞ ) to be the colimit of the induced sequence of finite Grassmannians: Grn (R ∞ ) = colim k→∞ [Grn (R k )]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 71</a>)</p>
Define γn → Grn (R∞ ) by γn = {(V, x) | V ⊂ R∞ , dim(V ) = n, x ∈ V }. This is the tautological vector bundle on the infinite grassmanian. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 71</a>)</p>
To any map f : X → Grn (R∞ ) we associate the pullback bundle f ∗ γn / γn  X f / Grn (R ∞ ). The assignment f 7→ f ∗ γn gives a map Hom(X, Grn (R∞ )) → Vectn (X). Observe that if f, g : X → Grn (R∞ ) are homotopic maps, then f ∗ γn ∼ = g ∗ γn by Corollary 11.2(a). In this way we have constructed a map φ : [X, Grn (R ∞ )] → Vectn (X). We will show that this is an isomorphism when X is compact and Hausdorff (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=71" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 71</a>)</p>
Theorem 11.8. The map φ : [X, Grn (R ∞ )] → Vectn (X) is always injective, and is bijective when X is compact and Hausdorff.

Proposition 11.10. Let X be a finite-dimensional CW-complex. For real vector bundles, Vectn (X) → Vectn+1 (X) is a bijection for n ≥ dim X + 1 and a surjection for n = dim X. For complex bundles, VectC n n C (X) → Vectn n+1 (X) is a bijection for n ≥ 21 dim X and a surjection for n ≥ 12 (dim X − 1).

Fix a space X. If E → X is a vector bundle of rank n, then of course E ⊕ 1 is a vector bundle of rank n + 1. We get a sequence of maps Vect0 (X) ⊕1 −→ Vect1 (X) ⊕1 −→ Vect2 (X) ⊕1 −→ · · · Are these maps injective? Surjective? Are there more and more isomorphism classes of vector bundles as one goes up in rank, or is it the case that all “large” rank vector bundles actually come from smaller ones via addition of a trivial bundle? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=72" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 72</a>)</p>
rank vector bundles actually come from smaller ones via addition of a trivial bundle? A homotopical analysis of classifying spaces allow us give some partial answers here.

this section we explore the set of isomorphism classes Vectn (S k ) for various values of k and n. There are two important points. First, for a fixed k these sets stablize for n 0. Secondly, Bott was able to compute these stable values completely and found an 8-fold periodicity (with respect to k) in the case of real vector bundles, and a 2-fold periodicity in the case of complex bundles. Bott’s periodicity theorems are of paramount importance in modern algebraic topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=72" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 72</a>)</p>

12.1. The clutching construction. Let X be a pointed space, and let C+ and C− be the positive and negative cones in ΣX. Fix n ≥ 0. For a map f : X → GLn (R), let En (f ) be the vector bundle obtained by gluing n|C+ and n|C− via the map f (we use Corollary 8.17(b) here). Precisely, if x ∈ X and v belongs to the fiber of n C+ over x then we glue v to f (x) · v in the fiber of n C− over x. This procedure for constructing vector bundles on ΣX is called clutching, and every bundle on ΣX arises in this way (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
Let us apply the above result when X is a sphere S k−1 . We obtain a bijection Vectn (S k ) ' πk−1 GLn (R). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
Recall that On ,→ GLn (R) is a deformation retraction, as a consequence of the Gram-Schmidt process (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
When k > 2 any based map S k−1 → On must actually factor through the connected component of the identity, which is SOn . So we have Vectn (S k ) ∼ = ∼ = πk−1 GLn (R) = ∼ = πk−1 On ∼ ∼ = ∼ = πk−1 SOn (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
12.3. Vector bundles on S 1 . For k = 1 and n > 0 we have that Vectn (S 1 ) ∼ = ∼ = π0 GLn (R) = Z/2, and we have previously seen in Example 11.3 that the two isomorphism classes are represented by n and M ⊕ (n − 1) where M is the Möbius bundle. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
12.4. Vector bundles on S 2 . Here we have Vectn (S 2 ) ∼ = ∼ = π1 SOn . Recall that SO2 ∼ = ∼ = S 1 , and so we get Vect2 (S 2 ) ∼ = ∼ = Z. We claim that for n > 2 one has π1 SOn ∼ = ∼ = Z/2, so that we have the following: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
Proposition 12.5. Vectn (S 2 ) ∼ = ∼ = π1 (SOn ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
For n = 3 recall that SO3 ∼ = ∼ = RP 3 , so that π1 (SO3 ) ∼ = ∼ = Z/2. To see the homeomorphism use the model R P 3 ∼ = ∼ = D 3 /∼ where the equivalence relation has x ∼ −x for x ∈ ∂D3 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
Proof. First of all SO1 = {1} and SO2 ∼ = ∼ = S 1 , so this takes care of n ≤ 2. For n = 3 recall that SO3 ∼ = ∼ = RP 3 , so (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 73</a>)</p>
Map D 3 → SO3 by sending a vector v to the rotation of R3 with axis hvi, through |v| · π radians, in the direction given by a right-hand-rule with the thumb pointed along v. Note that this makes sense even for v = 0, since the corresponding rotation is through 0 radians. For x ∈ ∂D3 this map sends x and −x to the same rotation, and so induces a map R P 3 → SO3 . This is clearly a continuous bijection, and therefore a homeomorphism since the spaces are compact and Hausdorff.

For n ≥ 4 one can use the long exact sequence associated to the fibration SOn−1 ,→ SOn  S n−1 to deduce that π1 (SOn ) ∼ = π1 (SOn−1 ).

Definition 12.6. Let O(n) ∈ Vect2 (S 2 ) be the vector bundle Efn where fn : S 1 → SO2 is a map of degree n. Note that O(0) ∼ = 2. The bundles O(n), n ∈ Z , give a complete list of the rank 2 bundles on S 2 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=74" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 74</a>)</p>
Putting all of this information together, the following table shows all the vector bundles on S 2 : n 1 2 3 4 5 6 Vectn (S 2 ) 1 O(n), n ∈ Z 3, O(1) ⊕ 1 4, O(1) ⊕ 2 5, O(1) ⊕ 3 ··· The operation (−) ⊕ 1 moves us from one column of the table to the next (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=74" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 74</a>)</p>
answer, namely what happens when one adds two rank 2 bundles (all other sums can be figured out once one knows how to do these): Theorem 12.7. O(j) ⊕ O(k) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=74" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 74</a>)</p>
It is a standard fact in topology that the group structure on [S 1 , SO4 ]∗ given by (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=74" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 74</a>)</p>
pointwise multiplication agrees with the group structure given by concatenation of loops (this is true with SO4 replaced by any topological group). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 75</a>)</p>
12.8. Vector bundles on S 3 . Now we have to calculate π2 SOn . This is trivial for n ≤ 2 (easy), and for n = 3 it also trivial: use SO3 ∼ = ∼ = RP 3 and the fibration sequence Z /2 ,→ S 3  R P 3 . Finally, the fibration sequences SOn−1 ,→ SOn  S n−1 now show that π2 SOn = 0 for all n. We have proven Proposition 12.9. Vectn (S 3 ) ∼ = ∼ = π2 (SOn ) ∼ = ∼ = 0. That is, every vector bundle on S 3 is trivializable. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 75</a>)</p>
12.10. Vector bundles on S 4 . Once again, we are reduced to calculating π3 SOn . Eventually one expects to get stuck here, but so far we have been getting lucky so let’s keep trying (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 75</a>)</p>
12.12. Vector bundles on S k . Although we can not readily do the calculations for k > 4, at this point one sees the general pattern. One must calculate πk−1 SOn for each n, and these groups vary for a while but eventually stabilize. In fact, πi SOn ∼ = ∼ = πi SOn+1 for i + 1 < n. The calculation of these stable groups was an important problem back in the 1950s, that was eventually solved by Bott. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=75" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 75</a>)</p>
The colimit of this sequence is denoted O and called the stable orthogonal group. The homotopy groups of O are the stable values that we encountered above. We computed the first few: π0 O = Z/2, π1 O = Z /2, π2 O = 0. And we stated, without proof, that π3 O = Z. Bott’s calculation showed the following: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=76" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 76</a>)</p>
The pattern is 8-fold periodic: πi+8 O ∼ = ∼ = πi O for all i ≥ 0. One is supposed to remember the pattern of groups to the tune of “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star”: zee two zee two ze ro zee ze ro ze ro ze ro zee.

12.13. Complex vector bundles on spheres. One can repeat the above analysis for complex vector bundles on a sphere. One finds that VectC n n (S k ) ∼ = ∼ = πk−1 (GLn (C)) ∼ = ∼ = πk−1 (Un ), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=76" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 76</a>)</p>
The stable value in the last row turns out to be 0, although one cannot figure this out without computing a connecting homomorphism in the long exact homotopy sequence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=76" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 76</a>)</p>
We can write the stable value as πi U where U is the infinite unitary group defined as the colimit of U1 ,→ U2 ,→ U3 ,→ · · · Bott computed the homotopy groups of U to be 2-fold periodic, with πi U = ( Z if i is odd 0 if i is even.

For a compact and Hausdorff space X, let KO(X) denote the Grothendieck group of real vector bundles over X. Swan’s Theorem gives that KO(X) ∼ = ∼ = Kalg (C(X)), where the latter denotes the Grothendieck group of finitely-generated projectives (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=77" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 77</a>)</p>
We can repeat this definition for both complex and quaternionic bundles, to define groups KU (X) and KSp(X), respectively. The group KU (X) is most commonly just written K(X) for brevity (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=77" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 77</a>)</p>
Remark 13.4. Both KO st (X) and g KO g (X, x) appear often in algebraic topology, and topologists are somewhat cavalier about mixing them up. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=77" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 77</a>)</p>
Finally, here is a third description of KO st (X). Consider the chain of maps Vect0 (X) ⊕1 −→ Vect1 (X) ⊕1 −→ Vect2 (X) ⊕1 −→ · · · The colimit is clearly the set of equivalence classes described in the preceding paragraph, and therefore coincides with KO st (X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 78</a>)</p>
Let Gr∞ ( R ∞ ) denote the colimit of these maps Gr1 (R ∞ ) ⊕1 −→ Gr2 (R ∞ ) ⊕1 −→ Gr3 (R ∞ ) ⊕1 −→ · · · (we really want the homotopy colimit, if you know what that is, but in this case the colimit has the same homotopy type and is good enough). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 78</a>)</p>
You might recall that Grn (R ∞ ) is also called BOn , and likewise Gr∞ (R ∞ ) is also called BO. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 78</a>)</p>
So we have learned that KO st (X) ' [X, BO]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 78</a>)</p>
The calculations of Bott therefore give us the values of g KO g (S KO k ). For k = 0 observe that KO(S 0 ) = KO(∗ t ∗) ∼ = ∼ g (S 0 ) ∼ = Z ⊕ Z, so we have KO = Z. This lets us fill out the table: Table 13.4. Reduced KO-theory of spheres k 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ··· g KO (S g k ) Z Z /2 Z /2 0 Z 0 0 0 Z Z /2 Z /2 0 ··· (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 78</a>)</p>
Applying this in particular to X = S k we have that for k ≥ 1 KO g (S KO k ) ∼ = ∼ = KO st (S k ) ∼ = ∼ = [S k , BO] ∼ = ∼ = [S k , BO]∗ = πk (BO) = πk−1 (O). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=78" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 78</a>)</p>
Theorem 13.5 (Bott Periodicity, Strong version). There is a weak equivalence of spaces Z × BO ' Ω8 ( Z × BO). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=79" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 79</a>)</p>
Using Bott Periodicity we can then calculate that for every pointed space X one has g KO g (Σ KO 8 X) = [Σ 8 X, Z × BO]∗ = [X, Ω 8 ( Z × BO)]∗ = [X, Z × BO]∗ = KO g KO g (X). Remark 13.6. In the complex case, Bott Periodicity gives the weak equivalence Z × BU ' Ω2 ( Z × BU ). Consequently one obtains K e K(Σ 2 X) ∼ = ∼ = K e K(X) e for all pointed spaces X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=79" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 79</a>)</p>
Homotopy classes of maps into a fixed space Z always give rise to exact sequences: Proposition 13.8. Let X, Y be pointed spaces, and let f : X → Y be a pointed map. Consider the mapping cone Cf and the natural map p : Y → Cf . For any pointed space Z, the sequence of pointed sets [X, Z]∗ ← [Y, Z]∗ ← [Cf, Z]∗ is exact in the middle. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=79" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 79</a>)</p>
Note that Cj0 ' ΣX and Cj1 ' ΣY (this is clear from the pictures). Up to sign the map Cj0 → Cj1 is just Σf , so that the sequence of spaces becomes periodic: X → Y → Cf → ΣX → ΣY → Σ(Cf ) → Σ 2 X → . . . This is called the Puppe sequence. Note that the composition of two subsequent maps is null-homotopic, and that every three successive terms form a cofiber sequence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=80" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 80</a>)</p>
Given f : X → Y we form the mapping cone Cf , which comes to us with an inclusion j0 : Y ,→ Cf . Next form the mapping cone on i, which comes with an inclusion j1 : Cf ,→ Cj0 . Keep doing this forever to get the sequence of spaces X → Y → Cf → Cj0 → Cj1 → · · · depicted below: Note that Cj0 ' ΣX and Cj1 ' ΣY (this is clear from the pictures). Up (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=80" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 80</a>)</p>
Now let Z be a fixed space and apply [−, Z]∗ to the Puppe sequence. We obtain the sequence of pointed sets [X, Z]∗ ← [Y, Z]∗ ← [Cf, Z]∗ ← [ΣX, Z]∗ ← [ΣY, Z]∗ ← [Σ(Cf ), Z]∗ ← . . . By Proposition 13.8 this sequence is exact at every spot where this makes sense (everywhere except at [X, Z]∗ ). At the left end this is just an exact sequence of pointed sets, but as one moves to the right at some point it becomes an exact sequence of groups (namely, at [ΣY, Z]∗ ). As one moves further to the right, it becomes an exact sequence of abelian groups by the time one gets to [Σ 2 Y, Z]∗ . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=80" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 80</a>)</p>
Definition 13.9. An infinite loop space is a space Z0 together with spaces Z1 , Z2 , Z3 , . . . and weak homotopy equivalences Zn ' ΩZn+1 for all n ≥ 0. Note that if Z is an infinite loop space then we really do get a long exact sequence—infinite in both directions—consisting entirely of abelian groups, having the form · · · ← [Cf, Zi+1 ] ← [X, Zi ]∗ ← [Y, Zi ]∗ ← [Cf, Zi ]∗ ← [X, Zi−1 ] ← · · · (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 81</a>)</p>
where it is convenient to use the indexing convention Z−n = Ω n Z for n > 0. This situation is very reminiscent of a long exact sequence in cohomology, so let us adopt the following notation: write E i (X) = [X+ , Zi ]∗ = ( [X+ , Zi ]∗ i ≥ 0, [Σ −i (X+ ), Z0 ]∗ i < 0. For an inclusion of subspaces j : A ,→ X write E i Z (X, A) = [Cj, Zi ]+ = ( [Cj, Zi ]∗ i ≥ 0, [Σ i (Cj), Z0 ]∗ i < 0. It is not hard to check that this is a generalized cohomology theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 81</a>)</p>
So we get a generalized cohomology theory whenever we have an infinite loop space. (You may know that it works the other way around, too: every generalized cohomology comes from an infinite loop space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 81</a>)</p>
For us the importance of all of this is that by Bott’s theorem we have Z × BO ' Ω 8 ( Z × BO) ' Ω 16 ( Z × BO) ' . . . . Thus, Z × BO is an infinite loop space and the above machinery applies. We obtain a cohomology theory KO ∗ . Moreover, periodicity gives us that KO i+8 (X, A) ∼ = ∼ = KO i (X, A), for any i. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 81</a>)</p>
Let us try to compute KO( R P 2 ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 81</a>)</p>
The point of this section was to construct the cohomology theories KO and K, having the properties that when X is compact and Hausdorff the groups KO 0 (X) and K 0 (X) coincide with the Grothendieck groups of real and complex vector bundles over X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 81</a>)</p>
Next use the fact that R P 2 can be built by attaching a 2-cell to R P 1 = S 1 , where the attaching map wraps S 1 around itself twice. That is, R P 2 is the mapping cone for S 1 2 2 −→ S 1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 81</a>)</p>
g 0 (S 1 ) = KOst (S 1 ) corresponds We have previously seen that the generator of KO to the Mobius bundle [M ] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 82</a>)</p>
g (S 2 ) = KOst (S 2 ) is [O(1)], and the generator of KO the rank 2 bundle whose clutching map is the isomomorphism S 1 → SO(2). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 82</a>)</p>
We happen to know one bundle on RP 2 , the tautological line bundle γ. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 82</a>)</p>
We need g to decide if 2[γ] = 0 in KOst (RP 2 ); if it is, then KO g (RP KO 2 ) ∼ = (Z/2)2 and if it is g (RP not then KO ) 2 ∼ = Z/4. So the question becomes: is γ ⊕ γ stably trivial? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 82</a>)</p>
The answer turns out to be that γ ⊕ γ is not stably trivial; this is an elementary exercise using characteristic classes (Stiefel-Whitney classes), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 82</a>)</p>
Note that this calculation demonstrates an important principle to keep in mind: often the machinery of cohomology theories get you a long way, but not quite to the end, and one has to do some geometry to complete the calculation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 82</a>)</p>
Recall that [E] in KOst (RP 2 ) corresponds to [E] − rank(E) in KO g KO g (RP 2 ); so the class we wrote as [γ] is [γ] − 1 in the shifted perspective, and we need to decide if 2([γ] − 1) = 0 in KO(RP 2 ). The element 1 − [γ] should be thought of as corresponding to a chain complex of vector bundles 0 → γ → 1 → 0, and thinking of it this way one finds that it plays the role of the K-theoretic fundamental class of the submanifold RP 1 ,→ RP 2 . Then (1 − [γ])2 represents the self-intersection product of RP 1 inside RP 2 , which we know is a point by the standard geometric argument (shown in the picture below, depicting an RP 1 and a small perturbation of it)): (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=82" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 82</a>)</p>
For the moment just get the idea that it is the intersection theory of submanifolds in RP g (RP that is ultimately forcing KO 2 ) to be Z/4 rather than (Z/2)2 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 83</a>)</p>
Remark 13.12. It seems worth pointing out that in fact for every n one has n ) ∼ = Z/2k g (RP n ) ∼ KO = Z/2k for a certain value k depending on n.

Exercise 13.13. It is a good idea for the reader to try his or her hand at similar calculations, to see how the machinery is working. Try calculating some of the groups below, at least for small values of n: • K(CP n ) (reasonably easy) • KO(CP n ) (a little harder) • K(RP n ) (even harder) • KO(RP n ) (hardest). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 83</a>)</p>
It is a classical problem to determine how many independent vector fields one can construct on a given sphere S n . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 83</a>)</p>
This problem was heavily studied throughout the 1940s and 1950s, and then finally solved by Adams in 1962 using K-theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 83</a>)</p>
It is one of the great successes of generalized cohomology theories. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 83</a>)</p>
14.1. The vector field problem. Given a nonzero vector u = (x, y) in R 2 , there is a formula for producing a (nonzero) vector that is orthogonal to u: namely, (−y, x). However, there is no analog of this that works in R 3 . That is, there is no single formula that takes a vector in R 3 and produces a (nonzero) orthogonal vector. If such a formula existed then it would give a nonvanishing vector field on S 2 , and we know that such a thing does not exist by elementary topology. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 83</a>)</p>
Let us next consider what happens in R4 . Given u = (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ), we can produce an orthogonal vector via the formula (−x2 , x1 , −x4 , x3 ). But of course this (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=83" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 83</a>)</p>
is not the only way to accomplish this: we can vary what pairs of coordinates we choose to flip. In fact, if we consider  −x      2 −x3 −x4  x1   x4  −x3  v 1 =  −x4  , v2 =  x1  , v3 =  x2  .      −x 4  , v2 =  x1  , v3 =  x2       x 3 −x2 x1 then we find that v1 , v2 , and v3 are not only orthogonal to u but they are orthogonal to each other as well. In particular, at each point of S 3 we have given an orthogonal basis for the tangent space. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
Question 14.2. On S n , how many vectors fields v1 , v2 , . . . , vr can we find so that v 1 , v2 , . . . , vr are linearly independent for each x ∈ S n ? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
Note that by the Gram-Schmidt process we can replace “linearly independent” by “orthonormal.” If n is even, the answer is zero because there does not exist even a single nonvanishing vector field on an even sphere. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
Let u ∈ S 5 have the standard coordinates. We notice that the vector v1 = (−x 2 , x1 , −x4 , x3 , −x6 , x5 ) is orthogonal to v. However, a little legwork shows that no other pattern of switching coordinates will produce a vector that is orthogonal to both u and v1 . Of course this does not mean that there isn’t some more elaborate formula that would do the job, but it shows the limits of what we can do using our naive constructions. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
For v ∈ S 7 we can divide the coordinates into the top four and the bottom four. Take the construction that worked for S 3 and repeat it simultaneously in the top and bottom coordinates—this yields a set of three orthonormal vector fields on S 7 , given by the formulas (14.2) (−x2 , x1 , −x4 , x3 , −x6 , x5 , −x8 , x7 ), (−x 3 , x4 , x1 , −x2 , −x7 , x8 , x5 , −x6 ), (−x 4 , −x3 , x2 , x1 , −x8 , −x7 , x6 , x5 ). This idea generalizes at once to prove the following: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
Proposition 14.3. If there exist r (independent) vector fields on S n−1 , then there also exist r vector fields on S kn−1 for all k. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
For example, since there is one vector field on S 1 we also know that there is at least one vector field on S 2k−1 for every k. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
Likewise, since there are three vector fields on S 3 we know that there are at least three vector fields on S 4k−1 for every k. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
Recall that S 3 is a Lie group, being the unit quaternions inside of H. We can choose an orthonormal frame at the origin and then use the group structure to push this around to any point, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=84" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 84</a>)</p>
hereby obtaining three independent vector fields; in other words, for any point x ∈ S 3 use the derivative of right-multiplication-by-x to transport our vectors in T 1 S 3 to Tx S 3 . The space S 7 is not quite a Lie group, but it still has a multiplication coming from being the set of unit octonions. The multiplication is not associative, but this is of no matter—the same argument works to construct 7 vector fields on S 7 . Note that this immediately gives us 7 vectors fields on S 15 , S 23 , etc. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=85" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 85</a>)</p>
Based on the data so far, one would naturally guess that if n = 2r then there are n − 1 vector fields on S n−1 . However, this guess turns out to fail already when n = 16 (and thereafter). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=85" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 85</a>)</p>
To give a sense of how the numbers grow, we give a chart showing the maximum number of vector fields known to exist on low-dimensional spheres: n 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 n−1 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 v.f. on S n−1 1 3 1 7 1 3 1 8 1 3 1 7 1 3 1 9 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=85" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 85</a>)</p>
Definition 14.4. If n = m · 2a+4b where m is odd, then the Hurwitz-Radon number for n is ρ(n) = 2a + 8b − 1. Theorem 14.5 (Hurwitz-Radon). There exist at least ρ(n) independent vector fields on S n−1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=85" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 85</a>)</p>
We will prove the Hurwitz-Radon theorem by a slick, modern method using Clifford algebras. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=85" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 85</a>)</p>
14.6. Sums-of-squares formulas. Hurwitz and Radon were not actually thinking about vector fields on spheres. They were instead considering an algebraic question about the existence of certain kinds of “composition formulas” for quadratic forms. For example, the following identity is easily checked: (x21 + x22 ) · (y12 + y22 ) = (x1 y1 − x2 y2 )2 + (x1 y2 + x2 y1 )2 . Hurwitz and Radon were looking for more formulas such as this one, for larger numbers of variables: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=85" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 85</a>)</p>
Definition 14.7. A sum-of-squares formulas of type [r, s, n] is an identity (x21 + x22 + . . . + x2r )(y12 + y22 + . . . + ys2 ) = z12 + z22 + . . . + zn2 in the polynomial ring R[x1 , . . . , xr , y1 , . . . , ys ], where each zi is a bilinear expression in x’s and y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=86" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 86</a>)</p>
We will often just refer to an “[r, s, n]-formula”, for brevity. For what values of r, s, and n does such a formula exist? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=86" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 86</a>)</p>
This is currently an open question. There are three formulas that are easily produced, coming from the normed algebras C, H, and O. The multiplication is a bilinear pairing, and the identity |xy|2 = |x|2 |y|2 is the required sums-of-squares formula. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=86" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 86</a>)</p>
Perhaps surprisingly, most of what is known about the non-existence of sumsof-squares formulas comes from topology. To phrase the question differently, we are looking for a function φ : R r ⊗ R s → R n such that |φ(x, y)|2 = |x|2 · |y|2 for all x ∈ R r and y ∈ R s . The bilinear expressions z1 , . . . , zn are just the coordinates of φ(x, y). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=86" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 86</a>)</p>
Corollary 14.9. If an [r, n, n]-formula exists, then there exist r − 1 independent vector fields on S n−1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=86" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 86</a>)</p>
Therefore we have established that φ(e2 , −), φ(e 3 , −), . . . , φ(er , −) are orthonormal vector fields on S n−1 .

14.10. Clifford algebras. We have seen that we get r − 1 independent vector fields on S n−1 if we have a sums-of-squares formula of type [r, n, n]. Having such a formula amounts to producing matrices A2 , A3 , . . . , Ar ∈ On such that A2i = −I and Ai Aj + Aj Ai = 0 for i 6= j. If we disregard the condition that the matrices be orthogonal, we can encoded the latter two conditions by saying that we have a representation of a certain algebra: Definition 14.11. The Clifford algebra Clk is defined to be the quotient of the tensor algebra Rhe1 , . . . , ek i by the relations e2i = −1 and ei ej + ej ei = 0 for all i 6= j. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 87</a>)</p>
The first few Clifford algebras are familiar: Cl0 = R, Cl1 = C, and Cl2 = H. After this things become less familiar: for example, it turns out that Cl3 = H × H (we will see why in just a moment). It is somewhat of a miracle that it is possible to write down a precise description of all of the Clifford algebras, and all of their modules. Before doing this, let us be clear about why we are doing it: Theorem 14.12. An [r, n, n]-formula exists if and only if there exists a Clr−1 module structure on R n . Consequently, if there is a Clr−1 -module structure on R n then there are r − 1 independent vector fields on S n−1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 87</a>)</p>
The collection of monomials e i 1 · · · eir for 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < · · · < ir ≤ k give a vector space basis for Clk , which has size 2k (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=87" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 87</a>)</p>
But a miracle now occurs, in that we can analyze all the Clifford algebras by a simple trick. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 88</a>)</p>
To do this part of the argument, we need a slight variant on our Clifford algebras. Given a real vector space V and a quadratic form q : V → R, define Cl(V, q) = TR (V )/hv ⊗ v = q(v) · 1 | v ∈ V i. For R with k q(x1 , . . . , xk ) = −(x21 + · · · + x2k ) this recovers the algebra Clk . For q(x 1 , . . . , xk ) = x21 + · · · + x2k this gives a new algebra we will call Cl − k . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 88</a>)</p>
Proposition 14.14. There are isomorphisms of algebras Cl ± ∼ k = ∼ ± = Cl2 ∓ ⊗R Clk−2 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 88</a>)</p>
In the analysis that follows we will write A(n) for the algebra Mn×n (A), whenever A is an algebra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=88" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 88</a>)</p>

14.17. Modules over Clifford algebras. Now that we know all the Clifford algebras, it is actually an easy process to determine all of their finitely-generated modules. We need three facts: • If A is a division algebra then all modules over A are free; • By Morita theory, the finitely-generated modules over A(n) are in bijective correspondence with the finitely-generated modules over A. The bijection sends an A-module M to the A(n)-module M n . • If R and S are algebras then modules over R × S can all be written as M × N where M is an R-module and N is an S-module (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=91" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 91</a>)</p>

Recall that if Clr−1 acts on R n then there are r − 1 independent vector fields on S n−1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=91" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 91</a>)</p>
Going down the rows of the above table, we make the following deductions: Cl 1 acts on R2 , therefore we have 1 vector field on S Cl 2 acts on R4 , therefore we have 2 vector field on S (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=91" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 91</a>)</p>
the smallest dimension of a nonzero module over Clr is 2σ(r) where σ(r) = #{s : 0 < s ≤ r and s ≡ 0, 1, 2, or 4 mod (8)} 2 σ(r) −1 −1 We know that we can construct r independent vector fields on S 2 .

We will eventually see, following [ABS], that there is a very direct connection between the groups KO∗ and the module theory of the Clifford algebras.

14.20. Adams’s Theorem. So far we have done all this work just to construct collections of independent vector fields on spheres. The Hurwitz-Radon lower bound is classical, and was probably well-known in the 1940’s. The natural question is, can one do any better? Is there a different construction that would yield more vector fields than we have managed to produce? People were actively working on this problem throughout the 1950’s. Adams finally proved in 1962 [Ad2] that the Hurwitz-Radon bound was maximal, and he did this by using K-theory: Theorem 14.21 (Adams). There do not exist ρ(n) + 1 independent vector fields on S n−1 .

Proposition 14.22. If there are r − 1 vector fields on S n−1 then the projection RP un−1 /RP un−r−1 → RP un−1 /RP un−2 ∼ = ∼ = S un−1 has a section in the homotopy 2k−2 2k−2 category, for every u > n . n (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 93</a>)</p>
Define V k (Rn ) = {(u1 , . . . , uk ) | ui ∈ R n and u1 , . . . , uk are orthonormal}. This is called the Stiefel manifold of k-frames in R n .

Consider the map p 1 : Vk (Rn ) → S n−1 which sends (u1 , . . . , un ) 7→ u1 . There exist r vector fields on S n−1 if and only if there is a section of p1 : Vr+1 (Rn ) → S n−1 . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 93</a>)</p>
We need a fact from basic topology, namely that there is a cell structure on V k (Rn ) where the cells look like e i 1 × · · · × eis with n − k ≤ i1 < i2 < · · · < is ≤ n − 1 and s is arbitrary. We will not prove this here: see Hatcher [Ha, Section 3.D] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=93" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 93</a>)</p>
Proposition 14.23. If n + 2 > 2k then the n-skeleton of our cell structure on V k (Rn ) is homeomorphic to RP n−1 /RP n−k−1 .

Exercise 14.24. Use singular cohomology to prove that RP n−1 /RP n−3 → S n−1 does not have a section when n is odd. Deduce that an even sphere does not have a non-vanishing vector field (which you already knew).

At this point we have seen that there exist cohomology theories K ∗ (−) and KO∗ (−). We have not proven their existence, but we have seen that their existence falls out as a consequence of the Bott periodicity theorems Ω2 (Z × BU ) ' Z × BU and Ω8 (Z × BO) ' Z × BO. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 94</a>)</p>
To some extent we have a “geometric” understanding of K 0 (−) and KO0 (−) in n terms of Grothendieck groups of vector bundles. We also know that any K n (−) (or n (−)) group can be shifted to a K 0 KOn (−)) group can be shifted to a K 0 (−) group using the suspension isomorphism and Bott periodicity (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 94</a>)</p>
. One often hears a slogan like “The geometry behind K-theory lies in vector bundles”. This slogan, however, doesn’t really say very much; our aim will be to do better. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 94</a>)</p>
One way to encode geometry into a cohomology theory is via Thom classes for vector bundles. Such classes give rise to fundamental classes for submanifolds and a robust connection wth intersection theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 94</a>)</p>
The theory of Thom classes begins with the cohomological approach to orientations. Recall that (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 94</a>)</p>
Moreover, an orientation on R n determines a generator for H n (Rn , Rn − 0) ∼ = ∼ = Z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 94</a>)</p>
Now consider a vector bundle p : E → B of rank n. Let ζ : B → E be the zero section, and write E −0 as shorthand for E −im(ζ). For any x ∈ B let Fx = p−1 (x). n (Fx , Fx − 0) ∼ = Then H n (Fx , Fx − 0) ∼ = Z, and an orientation of the fiber gives a generator. We wish to consider the problem of giving compatible orientations for all the fibers at once; this can be addressed through the cohomology of the pair (E, E − 0). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 94</a>)</p>
Pick a generator UV ∈ H (EV , EV − 0) n ∼ = Z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 94</a>)</p>
For a neighborhood V of x, let EV = E|V = p−1 (V ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 94</a>)</p>
We think of UV as orienting all of the fibers simultaneously. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=95" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 95</a>)</p>
Definition 15.1. Given a rank n bundle E → B, a Thom class for E is an element UE ∈ H n (E, E − 0) such that for all x ∈ B, jx∗ (UE ) is a generator in H n (Fx , Fx − 0). (Here jx : Fx ,→ E is the inclusion of the fiber). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=95" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 95</a>)</p>
There is no guarantee that a bundle has a Thom class. Indeed, consider the following example: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=95" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 95</a>)</p>
If a bundle E → B has a Thom class then the bundle is called orientable. Said differently, an orientation on a vector bundle E → B is simply a choice of Thom class in H n (E, E − 0; Z). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=96" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 96</a>)</p>
One can also talk about Thom classes with respect to the cohomology theories H ∗ (−; R) for any ring R. Typically one only needs R = Z and R = Z/2, however. In the latter case, note that any n-dimensional real vector space V has a canonical orientation in H n (V, V − 0; Z/2). It follows that local Thom classes always patch together to give global Thom classes, and so every vector bundle has a Thom class ∗ in H ∗ (−; Z/2). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=96" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 96</a>)</p>
Finally, note that we can repeat all that we have done for complex vector spaces and complex vector bundles. However, a complex vector space V of dimension n has a canonical orientation on its underlying real vector space, and therefore a canonical generator in H 2n (V, V − 0). Just as in the last paragraph, this implies that local Thom classes always patch together to give global Thom classes; so every complex vector bundle has a Thom class. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=96" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 96</a>)</p>
Theorem 15.3. (a) Every complex bundle E → B of rank n has a Thom class in H 2n (E, E − 0). (b) Every real bundle E → B of rank n has a Thom class in H n (E, E − 0; Z/2).

Theorem 15.4 (Thom Isomorphism Theorem). Suppose that p : E → B has a Thom class UE ∈ H ∗ (E, E − 0). Then the map H ∗ (B) → H ∗ (E, E − 0) given by z 7→ p∗ (z) ∪ UE is an isomorphism of graded abelian groups that increases degrees by n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=96" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 96</a>)</p>
15.5. Thom spaces. The relative groups H ∗ (E, E − 0) coincide with the reduced cohomology groups of the mapping cone of the inclusion E − 0 ,→ E. This mapping cone is sometimes called the Thom space of the bundle E → B, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 97</a>)</p>
Definition 15.6. Suppose that E → B is a bundle with an inner product. Define the disk bundle of E as D(E) = {v ∈ E | hv, vi ≤ 1}, and the sphere bundle of E as S(E) = {v ∈ E | hv, vi = 1}. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 97</a>)</p>
This diagram shows that E − 0 ,→ E and S(E) ,→ D(E) have weakly equivalent mapping cones (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 97</a>)</p>
Unlike E −0 ,→ E, however, the map S(E) ,→ D(E) is a cofibration (under the mild condition that X is cofibrant, say): so the mapping cone is weakly equivalent to the quotient D(E)/S(E). This quotient is what is most commonly meant by the term ‘Thom space’: Definition 15.7. For a bundle E → B with inner product, the Thom space of E is Th E = D(E)/S(E). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 97</a>)</p>
Note that if B is compact then Th E is homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of the space E. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=97" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 97</a>)</p>
To see this it is useful to first compactify all the fibers separately, which amounts to forming the pushout of B ← S(E) → D(E).

k ) ∼ = RP n+k /RP n−1 Example 15.9. We will show that Th(nL → RP k ) ∼ = RP n+k /RP n−1 , where L is the tautological line bundle.

Proposition 15.13. For any real bundle E → X one has Th(E ⊕ n) ∼ = Σn Th(E). ∼ 2n = Σ For a complex bundle E → X one has Th(E ⊕ n) ∼ 2n = Σ Th(E).

15.12. Thom spaces for virtual bundles. Thom spaces behave in a very simple way in relation to adding on trivial bundles: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 99</a>)</p>
From this one readily sees that D(E ⊕ n)/S(E ⊕ n) ∼ = [D(E)/S(E)] ∧ [Dn /S n−1 ] ∼ = Th(E) ∧ S n (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 99</a>)</p>
Proposition 15.13 allows one to make sense of Thom spaces for virtual bundles, provided that we use spectra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 99</a>)</p>
these Thom spectra play a large role in modern algebraic topology. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=99" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 99</a>)</p>
15.14. An application to stunted projective spaces. To demonstrate the usefulness of Thom spaces we give an application to periodicities amongst stunted projective spaces. This material will be needed later, in the solution of the vector fields on spheres problem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 100</a>)</p>
The natural question arises: fixing a and b, what values of r (if any) satisfy Σ r [RP a+b /RP a ] ' RP a+b+r /RP a+r .

One can use singular cohomology and Steenrod operations to produce some necessary conditions here. For example, integral singular homology easily yields that if if b ≥ 2 then r must be even. Use of Steenrod operations produces more stringent conditions ( (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Dugger Daniel/Geometric Intro to K-Theory (702)/Geometric Intro to K-Theory - Dugger Daniel.pdf#page=100" target="_blank">Dugger Daniel 100</a>)</p>

The cohomology H  .X; Q/ of a space is a DGA (with d D 0), but the singular cochain complex C  .X; Q/ is not (the signed commutativity fails).

This was solved in an abstract manner by Quillen, and in an attempt to better understand this, Sullivan was led to the p.l. forms and the connection between differential forms and homotopy type.

The commutative cochain problem. Perhaps the main genesis of the theory we are considering is the problem of commutative cochains. This was solved (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=101" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 101</a>)</p>
one fundamental point was missing in that Whitney only constructs commutative cochains over R, and as already mentioned there is no way to build Postnikov towers over R and thus tie in the commutative cochains with homotopy type.

Moreover, a somewhat grizzly computation shows that on the cohomology level, we have graded commutativity (iii) Œ’p  [ Œ“q  D .1/pq Œ“q  [ Œ’p . However, it is obviously false that ’p [ “q D .1/pq “q [ ’p on the cochain level. Now one may attempt to modify the formula so as to have all three properties, but all such attempts are doomed to failure since, as realized by Steenrod 35 years ago, the failure to find commutative cochains over Z is reflected in the existence of cohomology operations, such as the Steenrod squares (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=102" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 102</a>)</p>

Theorem. Let C  .X/ be any solution to the commutative cochain problem over Q. Then the minimal model M for C  .X/ gives the Q-homotopy type of X.

The problem of commutative cochains is equivalent to finding not only the cohomology but also the Q-homotopy type of a space from a cochain complex. The p.l. forms explicitly solve this problem, and moreover, a simple comparison theorem shows that the C 1 forms give the R-homotopy type of a smooth manifold.

, Whitney essentially showed that any solution to the commutative cochain problem over R satisfying a mild continuity condition is given by integration of suitable differential forms (the flat forms) over chains. Now, almost 25 years later, we have finally understood what he was driving at.

One of the main results of this chapter is that every simply connected DGA has a minimal model.

Actually the fundamental property of a minimal algebra is that it is an increasing sequence of subalgebras which are nicely related (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=103" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 103</a>)</p>

It is a simple argument to show that the elements of finite order in a nilpotent group form a subgroup Tor N (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 127</a>)</p>
Mal’cev [14] proved that if N is a nilpotent group, then N=Tor N can be embedded in a uniquely divisible nilpotent group N.0/ . (Uniquely divisible means x n D a has exactly one solution x 2 N for all a 2 N and n 2 ZC .) If we take N.0/ to be minimal among all uniquely divisible nilpotent groups containing N , then N.0/ is determined up to isomorphism by N. It is called the Mal’cev completion of N.

Thus, we have shown that assigning to based simplicial complexes their 1minimal models is a functor from based homotopy category of simplicial complexes to 1-minimal models and base point preserving maps between them (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=130" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 130</a>)</p>

A space is said to be formal if the homotopy type of the DGA of forms on the space is the same as the homotopy type of the cohomology ring of the space.

If X is a closed Riemannian manifold, then there is a canonical map .H  .X/; d D 0/ !

for X to admit a Riemannian metric in which the wedge product of harmonic forms is harmonic, it must be the case that X is formal (over R).

This shows that such homotopy types are classified by equivalence classes of symmetric bilinear pairings (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=140" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 140</a>)</p>
It is unknown which pairings arise from closed simply connected smooth 4-manifolds but for closed, simply connected topological 4-manifolds all pairings satisfying Poincaré duality over the integers occur; see [5].

Suppose that fW M ! B is a proper smooth submersion of smooth manifolds. Then fW M ! B is a smoothly locally trivial fibration.

Before Sullivan’s work on differential forms and rational homotopy theory, in [19] Quillen had established algebraic models for rational homotopy theory. Quillen worked dually from the way Sullivan does: Instead of using differential forms as the basic model, Quillen uses differential graded Lie algebras. One can, as Quillen does, associate a differential graded, co-commutative co-algebra to a differential graded Lie algebra. Dualizing this produces a differential graded algebra computing the rational homotopy type and thus in some sense solves the rational commutative cochain problem. Sullivan’s construction was much more directly tied to differential forms on the space, whereas Quillen’s went through more homotopy theoretic constructions, i.e., the simplicial set (of singular simplices) associated with the loop space of the given space (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=168" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 168</a>)</p>

A graded Lie algebra (GLA) is a graded vector space L D ˚k Lk together with a homomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=168" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 168</a>)</p>
17.3 The Bar Construction (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=170" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 170</a>)</p>
There are many variants of the bar construction. The one that is relevant for us here goes from a differential graded Lie algebra to a differential graded co-commutative, co-associative co-algebra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=170" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 170</a>)</p>
Theorem 17.1. Quillen assigns a reduced DGLA, .L.X/; @/, to a simply connected topological space X in a functorial way. Applying the bar construction to .L.X/; @/ produces a co-commutative differential graded co-algebra Q .X/. Dualizing this produces a DGA Q  .X/ functorially associated to X. Suppose that the rational homotopy groups of X in each degree are finite dimensional. If K is a simplicial complex and fW K ! X is a weak homotopy equivalence, then the minimal model MK for the p.l. forms A  .K/ and the minimal model MX for the DGA Q  .X/ are identified by a map determined up to homotopy by the homotopy class of f. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=172" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 172</a>)</p>
Some examples are in order: 1. A simplicial set (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=174" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 174</a>)</p>
The first and motivating example is that of the simplicial set of a topological space X. The simplicial set associated to X has Sn .X/ equal to the set of singular n-simplices of X, i.e., the set of continuous maps  n ! X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=174" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 174</a>)</p>
As we remarked above, the homotopy groups of a simplicial set K are easiest to define when the simplicial set satisfies is a Kan complex (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=174" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 174</a>)</p>
In general, to define the homotopy groups, one has to replace a simplicial set by an equivalent Kan complex, which can always be done. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=174" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 174</a>)</p>
Any simplicial group is a Kan complex, and therefore, we can directly define the homotopy groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=175" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 175</a>)</p>
Associated to a Lie algebra we have its Universal Enveloping Algebra which is a Hopf algebra, though the algebra structure is not commutative (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=176" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 176</a>)</p>
The Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem says that L embeds in its Universal Enveloping Algebra as the space of primitive elements (those satisfying .a/ D a˝1C1˝a). In fact, there is an equivalence of categories between Lie algebras and Hopf algebras (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=176" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 176</a>)</p>
The primary example for us comes from the rational group ring QG of a group G. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=177" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 177</a>)</p>
An element x is group-like if .x/ D x ˝ x. Group-like elements in a complete Hopf algebra are congruent to 1 modulo in the augmentation ideal (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)</p>
. To a topological space X, we associated the simplicial group G.X/ which is the analogue of the loop space applied to the simplicial set of (1-trivial) singular simplices in X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)</p>
Quillen passes from the category of reduced simplicial groups to the category of reduced simplicial Hopf algebras over Q that are complete with respect to the augmentation ideal. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)</p>
. This passage is the application of the simplicial functor to the b map that associates to a group the completion QG of the rational group ring QG with respect to the augmentation ideal. Since G0 D feg, the simplicial Hopf algebra with respect to the augmentation ideal (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)</p>
There is an adjoint to this functor that associates to a reduced, complete Hopf algebra its group of group-like elements (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)</p>
Lastly, we pass from a simplicial Lie algebra to a differential graded Lie algebra as follows (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=178" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 178</a>)</p>
This then is Quillen’s functorial assignment of a DGLA to a simply connected topological space. As we have already remarked, we can apply the bar construction to pass from a DGLA to a co-commutative, co-associative co-algebra and then by duality to a DGA. The resulting DGA has the same minimal model as the p.l. forms on a simplicial complex homotopy equivalent to X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=179" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 179</a>)</p>
These developments began with A1 -spaces and A1 -structures in the 1960s and have been developed in the intervening years to what now goes under the name of the theory of operads (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=180" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 180</a>)</p>
intervening years to what now goes under the name of the theory of operads. One of the first results of this theory was Stasheff’s characterization [24] of those topological spaces that are homotopy equivalent to loop spaces as being A1 -spaces. (Indeed, an A1 -structure on a space determines the homotopy type of its classifying space, that is to say, its de-looping.) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=180" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 180</a>)</p>
These ideas, originating in homotopy theory, have also been crucial recently for developments in symplectic geometry, in particular in formulating the symplectic side of the mirror symmetry conjecture which originated in physics. One now formulates the appropriate object associated to a symplectic manifold as an A1 -category of Lagrangian submanifolds of the symplectic manifold, the Fukaya category (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=180" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 180</a>)</p>
An (nonsymmetric) operad is a collection of sets fPn gn1 together with functions, defined for each .n; j/  1 and i with 1  i  n, OŒ.n; j/I iW Pj  Pn ! PnCj1 and also a distinguished element 1 2 P1 that acts as a unit for the operations OŒ.n; 1/I i  for every 1  i  n. These operations are required to satisfy the following natural composition axioms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=181" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 181</a>)</p>

Definition. Given an operad P D fPn g, the set X is an algebra over the operad if there is a morphism of operads from P ! End.X/. Said another way, for each pn 2 Pn determines a function f.pn /W Xn ! X in such a way that under this correspondence the structure maps of the operad P are mapped to the corresponding compositions of functions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=182" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 182</a>)</p>
A space X is an algebra over the associahedron operad if there are continuous maps Kn  Xn ! X compatible with the structure maps of the operad. Said another way, End.X/ is naturally an operad of topological spaces and X is an algebra over the associahedron operad if there is a map of topological operads K ! End.X/. These objects are also called A1 -spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=184" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 184</a>)</p>
Stasheff not only introduced the associahedra, he proved that an A1 -space X has a classifying space BX, so that an A1 -space is a loop space (up to homotopy equivalence). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=184" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 184</a>)</p>
There is an algebraic version of A1 -spaces called A1 -algebras. These algebras can be defined as algebras (in the category of graded vector spaces) over the operad in the induced category of differential graded vector spaces consisting of cellular chain complexes of the associahedra with the induced structure maps from the associahedra operad (thought of as an operad in the category of cell complexes and cellular maps). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=184" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 184</a>)</p>
Definition. An A1 -algebra is a graded vector space V, and for every n  1, a map (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=184" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 184</a>)</p>
The motivating example occurs in [6]. The objects formalized from what they did are called Fukaya categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=185" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 185</a>)</p>
The motivating example was to formalize the algebraic structure associated with the Lagrangian Floer homology of a symplectic manifold. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=185" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 185</a>)</p>
Given a symplectic manifold M, we form an A1 -category whose objects are Lagrangian submanifolds of M. For Lagrangian submanifolds L and L 0 by definition, Hom.L; L 0 / is the Floer cochain complex CF.L; L 0 /. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=186" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 186</a>)</p>
Under suitable hypotheses (see [20] for one such context), these structure maps produce an A1 -category structure, which is the Fukaya category of this symplectic manifold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=186" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 186</a>)</p>
To do this we introduce the graded-commutative analogue of A1 -algebras; see [10]. These are the so-called C1 -algebras. They are the quotient of A1 -algebras when one forces graded commutativity (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=186" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 186</a>)</p>

Let A  be a DGA. We can view this as a C1 -algebra with m1 D d, with m2 being the multiplication in the algebra, and with mi D 0 for all i > 2. We have the following theorem of Kadeishvili [10]. It says that up to homotopy equivalence, we can collapse A  onto its cohomology at the expense of endowing the cohomology with a possibly nontrivial C1 -structure.

There is an analogous theorem in the noncommutative case that says a (not necessarily commutative) DGA is equivalent in an appropriate homotopy category to an A1 -algebra structure on its cohomology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Philip Griffiths, John Morgan/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms (436)/Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential - Philip Griffiths, John Morgan.pdf#page=188" target="_blank">Philip Griffiths, John Morgan 188</a>)</p>

2 CHAPTER 1 WHERE PDEs COME FROM Some examples of PDEs (all of which occur in physical theory) are: 1. u x + u y = 0 (transport) 2. u x + yu y = 0 (transport) 3. u x + uu y = 0 (shock wave) 4. u x x + u yy = 0 (Laplace’s equation) 5. u tt − u x x + u 3 = 0 (wave with interaction) 6. u t + uu x + u x x x = 0 (dispersive wave) 7. u tt + u x x x x = 0 (vibrating bar) √ 8. u t − iux x = 0 (i = −1) (quantum mechanics) Each of these has two independent variables, written either as x and y or as x and t. Examples 1 to 3 have order one; 4, 5, and 8 have order two; 6 has order three; and 7 has order four. Examples 3, 5, and 6 are distinguished from the others in that they are not “linear.” We shall now explain this concept. Linearity means the following. Write the equation in the form lu = 0, where l is an operator. That is, if v is any function, lv is a new function. For instance, l = ∂/∂x is the operator that takes v into its partial derivative vx . In Example 2, the operator l is l = ∂/∂ x + y∂/∂ y. (lu = u x + yu y .) The definition we want for linearity is l(u + v) = lu + lv l(cu) = clu (3) for any functions u, v and any constant c. Whenever (3) holds (for all choices of u, v, and c), l is called linear operator. The equation lu = 0 (4) is called linear if l is a linear operator. Equation (4) is called a homogeneous linear equation. The equation lu = g, (5) where g = 0 is a given function of the independent variables, is called an inhomogeneous linear equation. For instance, the equation (cos x y 2 )u x − y 2 u y = tan(x 2 + y 2 ) (6) is an inhomogeneous linear equation. As you can easily verify, five of the eight equations above are linear as well as homogeneous. Example 5, on the other hand, is not linear because although (u + v)x x = u x x + vx x and (u + v)tt = u tt + vtt satisfy property (3), the cubic term does not: (u + v)3 = u 3 + 3u 2 v + 3uv 2 + v 3 = u 3 + v 3 . 2 CHAPTER 1 WHERE PDEs COME FROM Some examples of PDEs (all of which occur in physical theory) are: 1. u x + u y = 0 (transport) 2. u x + yu y = 0 (transport) 3. u x + uu y = 0 (shock wave) 4. u x x + u yy = 0 (Laplace’s equation) 5. u tt − u x x + u 3 = 0 (wave with interaction) 6. u t + uu x + u x x x = 0 (dispersive wave) 7. u tt + u x x x x = 0 (vibrating bar) √ 8. u t − iux x = 0 (i = −1) (quantum mechanics) Each of these has two independent variables, written either as x and y or as x and t.

1.1 WHAT IS A PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION? 3 The advantage of linearity for the equation lu = 0 is that if u and v are both solutions, so is (u + v). If u1 , . . . , un are all solutions, so is any linear combination  n c1 u 1 (x) + · · · + cn u n (x) = c j u j (x) (cj = constants). j=1 (This is sometimes called the superposition principle.) Another consequence of linearity is that if you add a homogeneous solution [a solution of (4)] to an inhomogeneous solution [a solution of (5)], you get an inhomogeneous solution. (Why?) The mathematical structure that deals with linear combinations and linear operators is the vector space. Exercises 5–10 are review problems on vector spaces. We’ll study, almost exclusively, linear systems with constant coefficients. Recall that for ODEs you get linear combinations. The coefficients are the arbitrary constants. For an ODE of order m, you get m arbitrary constants. Let’s look at some PDEs. Example 1. Find all u(x, y) satisfying the equation uxx = 0. Well, we can integrate once to get ux = constant. But that’s not really right since there’s another variable y. What we really get is ux (x, y) = f (y), where f (y) is arbitrary. Do it again to get u(x, y) = f (y)x + g(y). This is the solution formula. Note that there are two arbitrary functions in the solution. We see this as well in the next two examples.  Example 2. Solve the PDE u x x + u = 0. Again, it’s really an ODE with an extra variable y. We know how to solve the ODE, so the solution is u = f (y) cos x + g(y) sin x, where again f (y) and g(y) are two arbitrary functions of y. You can easily check this formula by differentiating twice to verify that u x x = −u.  Example 3. Solve the PDE uxy = 0. This isn’t too hard either. First let’s integrate in x, regarding y as fixed. So we get u y (x, y) = f (y). Next let’s integrate in y regarding x as fixed. We get the solution u(x, y) = F(y) + G(x), where F ′ = f.  1.1 WHAT IS A PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION? 3 The advantage of linearity for the equation lu = 0 is that if u and v are both solutions, so is (u + v).

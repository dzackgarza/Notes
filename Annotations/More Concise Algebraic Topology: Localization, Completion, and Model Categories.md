. What next? Possibly K-theory, which is treated in [3] and, briefly, [89], and some idea of cobordism theory [34, 89]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

A partial list of areas a student should learn is given in the suggestions for further reading of [89], and a helpful guide to further development of the subject (with few proofs) has been given by Selick [120].

the fundamental importance of the material is nowhere greater than in the theory of localization and completion of topological spaces 1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The notion of completion is particularly important because it relates directly to mod p cohomology, which is the invariant that algebraic topologists most frequently compute (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

some standard topics, such as fibration and cofibration sequences, Postnikov towers, and homotopy limits and colimits, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The only other preliminary that we require and that cannot be found in most of the books cited above is the Serre spectral sequence. There are several accessible sources for that, such as [32, 76, 95, 120], but to help make this book more self-contained, we shall give a concise primer on spectral sequences in Chapter 24 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

By far the longer of these parts is an introduction to model category theory. This material can easily be overemphasized, to the detriment of concrete results and the nuances needed to prove them. For example, its use would in no way simplify anything in the first half of the book. However, its use allows us to complete the first half by giving a conceptual construction and characterization of localizations and completions of general, not necessarily nilpotent, spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Anybody interested in any of these fields needs to know model category theory. It plays a role in homotopical algebra analogous to the role played by category theory in mathematics (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The most important of these is Bousfield localization, which we shall construct model theoretically (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

we can dualize the proof of the first theorem below (as given for example in [89]) to prove the second. Theorem 0.0.1. A weak homotopy equivalence e : Y −→ Z between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence. Theorem 0.0.2. An integral homology isomorphism e : Y −→ Z between simple spaces is a weak homotopy equivalence.

The argument is based on the dualization of cell complexes to cocell complexes, of which Postnikov towers are examples, and of the Homotopy Extension and Lifting Property (HELP) to co-HELP. Once this dualization is understood, it becomes almost transparent how one can construct and study the localizations and completions of nilpotent spaces simply by inductively localizing or completing their Postnikov towers one cocell at a time (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For conceptual clarity, we offer a slight reformulation of the original definition of a model category that focuses on weak factorization systems (WFS’s): a model category consists of a subcategory of weak equivalences together with a pair of related WFS’ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We argue that classical algebraic topology, over at least the mathematical lifetime of the first author, has implicitly worked in the m-model structure (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Colocalization is dual to Bousfield localization, and this brings us to another reason for our introduction to model category theory, namely a perceived need for as simple and accessible an approach to Bousfield localization as possible. This is such a centrally important tool in modern algebraic topology (and algebraic geometry) that every student should see it (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In algebraic topology, algebras are always graded and often connected, meaning that they are zero in negative degrees and the ground field in degree zero.

Under this assumption, bialgebras automatically have antipodes, so that there is no distinction between Hopf algebras and bialgebras. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In Chapter 22, we explain the Hopf algebra proof of Thom’s calculation of the real cobordism ring and describe how the method applies to other unoriented cobordism theories. We also give the elementary calculational proof of complex Bott periodicity (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Chapter 9, the structure theory for rational Hopf algebras is used to describe the category of rational H-spaces and to explain how this information is used to study H-spaces in general. In Chapter 22, we explain the Hopf algebra proof of Thom’s calculation of the real cobordism ring and describe how the method applies to other (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

. It is by now a standard convention in algebraic topology that spaces mean compactly generated spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

we implicitly restrict to spaces of the homotopy types of CW complexes whenever we talk about passage to homotopy. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

This allows us to define the homotopy category HoU simply by identifying homotopic maps; it is equivalent to the homotopy category of all spaces in U , not necessarily CW homotopy types, that is formed by formally inverting the weak homotopy equivalences.

meaning that the inclusion ∗ −→ X is a cofibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 13</a>)</p>
The conventions mean that, when passing to homotopy categories, we implicitly approximate all spaces by weakly homotopy equivalent CW complexes, as we can do by [89, §10.3]. In particular, when we use Postnikov towers and pass to limits, which are not of the homotopy types of CW complexes, we shall implicitly approximate them by CW complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The smash product X ∧ Y of based spaces X and Y is the quotient of the product X × Y by the wedge (or one-point union) X ∨ Y . We have adjunction homeomorphisms F (X ∧ Y, Z) ∼ = ∼ = F (X, F (Y, Z)) and consequent bijections [X ∧ Y, Z] ∼ = ∼ = [X, F (Y, Z)]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Let ZT denote the ring of integers localized at T , that is, the subring of Q consisting of rationals expressible as fractions k/ℓ, where ℓ is a product of primes not in T . We let Z[T −1 ] denote the subring of fractions k/ℓ, where ℓ is a product of primes in T . In particular, Z[p −1 ] has only p inverted. Let Z(p) denote the ring of integers localized at the prime ideal (p) or, equivalently, at the singleton set {p}. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Let Zp denote the ring of p-adic integers. Illogically, but to avoid conflict of notation, we write Ẑ ẐT for the product over p ∈ T of the rings Zp . We then write Q Q̂ Q̂T for the ring Ẑ ẐT ⊗Q; when T = {p}, this is the ring of p-adic numbers. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We write A(p) and ̂ Âp for the localization at p and the p-adic completion of an abelian group A (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In both the algebraic and topological literature, the ring Zp is sometimes denoted Z Ẑ Ẑp ; we would prefer that notation as a matter of logic, but the notation Zp has by now become quite standard.

With k = Fp , such graded fields appear naturally in algebraic topology as the coefficients of certain generalized cohomology theories, called Morava Ktheories, and their homological algebra works exactly as for any other field, a fact that has real calculational applications (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

consider a Laurent series algebra k[x, x −1 ] over a field k, where x has positive even degree. To an algebraic topologist, this is a perfectly good graded field: every non-zero element is a unit.

In categorical language, the category Ab∗ of graded abelian groups is a symmetric monoidal category under ⊗, meaning that ⊗ is unital (with unit Z concentrated in degree 0), associative, and commutative up to coherent natural isomorphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For an algebraic topologist, the commutativity isomorphism γ : A ⊗ B −→ B ⊗ A is specified by γ(a ⊗ b) = (−1) pq b ⊗ a where deg(a) = p and deg(b) = q. A graded k-algebra with product φ is commutative if φ ◦ γ = φ; elementwise, this means that ab = (−1)pq ba (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

but in algebraic topology this notion of commutativity is and always has been the default (at least since the early 1960’s). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

To an algebraic topologist, a polynomial algebra k[x] where x has odd degree is not a commutative k-algebra unless k has characteristic 2. The homology H∗ (ΩS n ; k), n even, is an example of such a non-commutative algebra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

a map i is a (based) cofibration if there is a lift λ in all such diagrams in which p is the map p0 : F (I+ , Y ) −→ Y given by evaluation at 0 for some space Y .

Lemma 1.1.6. Let f : X −→ Y be a map and Z be a space.

It is clear that two based maps that are in the same orbit under the action of π1 (Y, ∗) are freely homotopic. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

An H-space is a based space Y with a product µ : Y × Y −→ Y , written x · y or by juxtaposition, whose basepoint is a two-sided unit up to based homotopy.

That is, the maps y 7→ ∗ · y and y 7→ y · ∗ are both homotopic to the identity map. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 1.4.3. For an H-space Y , the action of π1 (Y, ∗) on [X, Y ] is trivial and therefore [X, Y ] ∼ = ∼ = [X, Y ]free . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 1.4.4. Take X = S n in Definition 1.4.1. The definition then specializes to define an action of the group π1 (Y, ∗) on the group πn (Y, ∗). When n = 1, this is the conjugation action of π1 (Y, ∗) on itself. A (connected) space Y is simple if π1 (Y, ∗) is abelian and acts trivially on πn (Y, ∗) for all n ≥ 2.

As observed there, the sets [X, Y ] are groups if X is a suspension or Y is a loop space and are abelian groups if X is a double suspension or Y is a double loop space. However, there is additional structure at the ends of these sequences that will play a role in our work. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

This is of greatest interest when Z = S 0 . Since [−, −] refers to based homotopy classes, [S 0 , X] = π0 (X) and the sequence becomes π1 (X) f ∗ / π1 (Y ) ι ∗ / π0 (F f ) p ∗ / π0 (X) f ∗ / π0 (Y ).

This specializes to give a group homomorphism π1 (B, b) −→ π0 (Aut(Fb )). Here Aut(Fb ) is the topological monoid of (unbased) homotopy equivalences of Fb . We think of π1 (B, b) as acting “up to homotopy” on the space Fb , meaning that an element β ∈ π1 (B, b) determines a well-defined homotopy class of homotopy equivalences Fb −→ Fb (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

(If p is a covering space, the action is by homeomorphisms, as in [89, p. 29].) As we shall use later, it follows that π1 (B) acts on the homology and cohomology groups of Fb .

Intuitively, homotopy colimits are constructed from ordinary categorical colimits by gluing in cylinders so as to give domains for homotopies that allow us to replace equalities between maps that appear in the specification of ordinary colimits by homotopies between maps (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Since homotopies between given maps are not unique, not even up to homotopy, homotopy colimits give weak colimits in the homotopy category, in the sense that they satisfy the existence but not the uniqueness property of ordinary colimits (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The equalizer E(α, β) of functions α, β : S −→ U is {s|α(s) = β(s)} ⊂ S, as we see by checking the universal property ([89, p. 16]).

The definition of lim1 Gi for an inverse sequence of abelian groups is given, for example, in [89, p. 146]. It generalizes to give a definition for not necessarily abelian groups. However, the result is only a set in general, not a group. Definition 2.1.8. Let γi : Gi+1 −→ Gi , i ≥ 0, be homomorphisms of groups. Define a right action of the group G = ×i Gi on the set S = ×i Gi by (si ) ∗ (gi ) = (g −1 si γi (gi+1 )). The set of orbits of S under this action is called lim1 Gi (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Observe that lim Gi is the set of elements of G that fix the element (1) ∈ S whose coordinates are the identity elements of the Gi .

If the maps αi are homotopy equivalences, then so is their colimit colim Xi −→ colim X ′ i′ . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Corollary 2.1.11. If the maps fi : Xi −→ Xi+1 are cofibrations, then the natural quotient map tel Xi −→ colim Xi is a homotopy equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 2.1.12. Let X be a (based) CW complex with n-skeleton X n . A map f : X −→ Z is called a phantom map if the restriction of f to X n is null homotopic for all n.

Warning 2.1.13. This is the original use of the term “phantom map”, but the name is also used in some, but by no means all, of the more recent literature for maps f : X −→ Z such f ◦ g is null homotopic for all maps g : W −→ X, where W is a finite CW complex (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Of course, the two notions agree when X has finite skeleta (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 39</a>)</p>
The name comes from the fact that, with either definition, a phantom map f : X −→ Z induces the zero map on all homotopy, homology, and cohomology groups, since these invariants depend only on skeleta, and in fact only on composites f ◦ g, where g has finite domain (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The lim1 terms that appear in Propositions 2.1.9 and 2.2.9 are an essential, but inconvenient, part of algebraic topology.

We consider a sequence of homomorphisms γi : Gi+1 −→ Gi . For j > i, let γ = γi γi+1 · · · γj−1 : Gj −→ Gi and let Gj = im γ . We say that the sequence {Gi , γi } satisfies the Mittag–Leffler condition if for each i there exists j(i) such that Gki i = G j(i) i for all k > j(i). That is, these sequences of images eventually stabilize. For example, this condition clearly holds if each γi is an epimorphism or if each Gi is a finite group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proof. Using mapping cylinders, we can replace f by a cofibration [89, p. 42]. Since weak equivalences induce isomorphisms on homology and cohomology, relative CW approximation [89, p. 76] and cellular approximation of maps [89, p. 74] show that we can replace X and Y by CW complexes with the same q-skeleton and can replace f by a cellular map that is the identity on the q-skeleton. Since in dimensions less than q the cellular chains and thus the homology and cohomology groups of a CW complex depend only on its q-skeleton, the conclusion follows.

A group is nilpotent if it has a central series that terminates after finitely many steps. It is equivalent that either its lower central series or its upper central series terminates after finitely many steps (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Call a group G a π-group if it has a (left) action of the group π as automorphisms of G. This means that we are given a homomorphism from π to the automorphism group of G (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We are thinking of π as π1 (X) and G as πn (X) for a space X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

On the other hand, when G is abelian, a π-group is just a module over the group ring Z[π]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Recall that a connected space X is simple if π1 X is abelian and acts trivially on πn X. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Clearly simple spaces and, in particular, simply connected spaces, are nilpotent. Connected H-spaces are simple and are therefore nilpotent. While it might seem preferable to restrict attention to simple or simply connected spaces, nilpotent spaces have significantly better closure properties under various operations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

the component F (X, Y )f of f in F (X, Y ) is nilpotent. This space is generally not simple even when X and Y are simply connected. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 3.2.1. A connected space X is simple if and only if it admits a Postnikov tower of principal fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We can always construct maps αn : X −→ Xn such that αn induces an isomorphism on πi for i ≤ n and πi Xn = 0 for i > n just by attaching cells inductively to kill the homotopy groups of X in dimension greater than n.

When X is simple, and only then, we can arrange further that Xn+1 is the homotopy fiber of a “k-invariant” k n+2 : Xn −→ K(πn+1 X, n + 2). This is what it means for X to have a “Postnikov tower of principal fibrations”. The name comes from the fact that Xn+1 is then the pullback along k n+2 of the path space fibration over K(πn+1 X, n + 2). Of course, the fiber of the resulting map pn+1 : Xn+1 −→ Xn is an Eilenberg-MacLane space K(πn+1 X, n + 1). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 53</a>)</p>
One then constructs k n+2 by killing the higher homotopy groups of the cofiber Cαn and defines Xn+1 to be the fiber of k n+2 . However, the proof there is not complete since the check requires a slightly strengthened version of homotopy excision or the relative Hurewicz theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We think of the maps Xn+1 −→ Xn as giving a decreasing filtration of X, and of course the fiber over the basepoint of this map is ΩKn . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Since right adjoints, such as P (−) or, more generally, F (X, −), preserve all categorical limits and since limits, such as pullbacks and sequential limits, commute with other limits, we find easily that products, pullbacks, and sequential limits of K -towers are again K -towers.

model category theory focuses on cell complexes rather than CW complexes, which in fact play no role in that theory. It often applies to categories in which cell complexes can be defined just as in Definition 3.3.3, but there is no useful notion of a CW complex because the cellular approximation theorem [89, p. 74] fails (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The essential idea is just to apply the representability of cohomology, ̃ H̃ n (X; A) ∼ = ∼ = [X, K(A, n)], which is dual to the representability of homotopy groups, πn X = [S n , X], (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

As we have noted, our towers Z = lim Zn are rarely of the homotopy types of CW complexes; it is for this reason that weak homotopy type rather than homotopy type appears in the following statement (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

, we shall go very slowly through the following proof since it gives our first application of the Serre spectral sequence and a very explicit example of how one uses the representability of cohomology, (3.4.1) ̃ H̃ n (X; A) ∼ = ∼ [X, K(A, n)], = to obtain homotopical information.

We regard K(A, n) as a name for any space whose only non-vanishing homotopy group is πn (K(A, n)) = A. With our standing CW homotopy type hypothesis, any two such spaces are homotopy equivalent.

application of πn induces a bijection from the homotopy classes of maps K(A, n) −→ K(A, n) to Hom(A, A). One way to see that is to quote the Hurewicz and universal coefficient theorems [ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Lemma 3.4.2. Let f : X −→ Y be a map of connected based spaces whose (homotopy) fiber F f is an Eilenberg-Mac Lane space K(A, n) for some abelian group A and n ≥ 1.

There is a map k : Y −→ K(A, n + 1) and an equivalence ξ : X −→ F k such that the following diagram commutes, where π is the canonical fibration with (actual) fiber K(A, n) = ΩK(A, n + 1) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

There is a map k : Y −→ K(A, n + 1) and an equivalence λ : N f −→ F k such that the following diagram commutes, where π is as in (i) and ρ : N f → Y is the canonical fibration with (actual) fiber F f .

Note that a product of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces Πj K(Aj , j) is an EilenbergMac Lane space K(Πj Aj , j).

The spaces Yn,j and maps X −→ Yn,j are constructed by attaching (n + 1)-cells to X to kill the subgroup Gn,j of πn (X), using maps S n −→ X that represent generators of Gn,j as attaching maps, and then attaching higher dimensional cells to kill the homotopy groups in dimensions greater than (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The circle S 1 is a K(Z, 1). Our first example of a localized space is ST1 T1 , which not surprisingly turns out to be K(ZT , 1). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Finally, consider A = Z, so that AT = ZT . The circle S 1 is a K(Z, 1). Our first example of a localized space is ST1 T1 , which not surprisingly turns out to be K(ZT , 1). AT can be constructed as the colimit of copies of Z together with the maps induced by multiplication by the primes not in T . For example, if we order the primes qi not in T by size and define rn inductively by r1 = q1 and rn = rn−1 q1 · · · qn = q1n . . . qn , then ZT is the colimit over n of the maps rn : Z −→ Z. We can realize these maps on π1 (S 1 ) by using the rn th power map S 1 −→ S 1 . Using the telescope construction ([89, p. 113]) to convert these multiplication maps into inclusions and passing to colimits, we obtain a space K(ZT , 1); the van Kampen theorem gives that the colimit has fundamental group ZT , and the higher homotopy groups are zero because a map from S n into the colimit has image in a finite stage of the telescope, which is equivalent to S 1 . The commutation of homology with colimits gives that the only non-zero reduced integral homology group of K(ZT , 1) is its first, which is ZT . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

One way to see this is to observe that the classifying space functor from groups to Eilenberg–Mac Lane spaces (e.g. [89, p. 126]) gives an inverse bijection to π1 , but it can also be verified directly from the elementary construction of K(G, 1)’s that is obtained by realizing π1 as the fundamental group of a space X ([89, p. 35]) and then killing the higher homotopy groups of X.

Using the homological characterization of localizations, we obtain analogues of the results in §6.2 for wedges, suspensions, cofiber sequences, and smash products. However, in the non-simply connected case, the required preservation of nilpotency is not automatic. Wedges behave badly, for example. The wedge S 1 ∨ S 1 is not nilpotent since a free group on two generators is not nilpotent, and the wedge S 1 ∨S 2 is not nilpotent since π1 does not act nilpotently on π2 .

The Künneth theorem also implies that the smash product of localizations is a localization (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Recall that an H-space, or Hopf space, X is a space together with a product X × X −→ X such that the basepoint ∗ ∈ X is a two-sided unit up to homotopy (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

topological monoids and loop spaces provide the canonical examples (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 6.6.2. If Y is an H-space with product µ, then YT is an H-space with product µT such that the localization φ : Y −→ YT is a map of H-spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The converse does not hold. There are many interesting spaces that are not H-spaces but have localizations that are H-spaces. In fact, in 1960, well before localizations were constructed in general, Adams [2] observed that STn Tn is an Hspace for all odd n and all sets T of odd primes.

In contrast, S n itself is an H-space only if n = 0, 1, 3, or 7, by Adams’ solution to the Hopf invariant one problem [1]. Here the Lie group S 3 is not homotopy commutative and the H-space S 7 given by the unit Cayley numbers is not homotopy associative (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The study breaks into two main variants. In one of them, one allows general finite T -local H-spaces, not necessarily homotopy associative or commutative, and asks what possible underlying homotopy types they might have. In the other, one studies finite T -local loop spaces, namely spaces X that are of the homotopy type of finite T -CW complexes and are also homotopy equivalent to ΩBX for some T -local space BX. Such X arise as localizations of finite loop spaces. One asks, typically, how closely such spaces resemble compact Lie groups and what limitations the H-space structure forces on the homology and homotopy groups. The structure theorems for Hopf algebras that we give later provide a key starting point for answering such questions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

A co-H-space Z is a space with a coproduct δ : Z −→ Z ∨ Z such that ∇ ◦ δ is homotopic to the identity, where ∇ : Z ∨ Z −→ Z is the folding map.

Proposition 6.6.4. For a simply connected co-H-space Z, the localization ZT can be constructed as the telescope of the sequence of rith ith -copower maps Z −→ Z.

Localization at the empty set of primes is called rationalization (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Many results in algebraic topology that preceded the theory of localization are conveniently proven using the newer theory. We illustrate this with a proof of a basic theorem of Serre on the finiteness of the homotopy groups of spheres. Serre proved the result using (Serre) classes of abelian groups [121]. The proof using rationalization is simpler and more illuminating. Theorem 6.7.1 (Serre). For n ≥ 1, the homotopy groups πq (S n ) are finite with the exceptions of πn (S n ) = Z for all n and π2n−1 (S n ) = Z ⊕ Fn for n even, where Fn is finite.

Proposition 6.7.2. The cohomology algebra H ∗ (K(Q, n); Q) is the exterior algebra on ιn if n is odd and the polynomial algebra on ιn if n is even. Proof. For n = 1 and n = 2, this is clear from Theorem 5.2.8 and the fact that S 1 = K(Z, 1) and CP ∞ = K(Z, 2). We proceed by induction on n, using the Serre spectral sequence of the path space fibration K(Q, n) −→ P K(Q, n + 1) −→ K(Q, n + 1). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

and the spectral sequence is concentrated on the 0th and nth rows. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Thus the rationalization of the homotopy group πq (S n ), q > 0, is 0 if q 6= 2n − 1 and is Q if q = 2n − 1. Since π2n−1 (S n ) is a finitely generated abelian group with rationalization Q, it must be the direct sum of Z and a finite group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=112" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 112</a>)</p>
This implies that all homotopy groups πq (S n ), q > n, are in the kernel of rationalization. That is, they are torsion groups. Since they are finitely generated by Theorem 4.5.7, they are finite.

Corollary 6.7.3. Consider the rationalization k0 : S n 0n −→ K(Q, n) of the canonical map k : S n −→ K(Z, n). If n is odd, k0 is an equivalence. If n is even, the fiber of k0 is K(Q, 2n − 1).

we give an observation that shows, in effect, that phantom maps are usually invisible to the eyes of rational homotopy theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In Chapter 5, we described how to construct localizations of nilpotent spaces. In the next chapter, we go in the opposite direction and describe how to start with local spaces and construct a “global space” and how to reconstruct a given global space from its localizations. Results such as these are referred to as fracture theorems (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We are mainly interested in the case when S is empty and localization at S is rationalization (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We are then starting with a partition of the set of primes in T , and we are most often interested in the case when T is the set of all primes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

I might be the positive integers and Ti might be the set consisting of just the ith prime number pi . A common situation is when I = {1, 2}, T1 = {p}, and T2 is the set of all other primes. For example, spaces often look very different when localized at 2 and when localized away from 2 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

It applies to any category that has categorical products. Such categories are said to be cartesian monoidal. Examples include the categories of abelian groups, groups, spaces, and sets. Less obviously, the homotopy category HoT is another example, even though pullbacks do not generally exist in HoT (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remark 7.2.2. Theorem 7.2.1(ii) was proven under a finite generation hypothesis in Hilton, Mislin, and Roitberg [60], and Hilton and Mislin later noticed that the hypothesis can be removed [59]. That fact is not as well-known as it should be. We learned both it and most of the elegant proof presented here from Bousfield. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The name comes from the fact that when ω exists, it turns out that the map µi : P −→ Gi in (7.3.2) is a localization at Ti , hence the map ν is a localization at S and ω is the localization of (µi ) at S.

Definition 7.5.1. Let G be a nilpotent group. The extended genus of G is the collection of isomorphism types of nilpotent groups G ′ such that the localizations Gp and G′ ′p ′p are isomorphic for all primes p. If G is finitely generated, then the genus of G is the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated nilpotent groups in the extended genus of G. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Let Aut(G) denote the group of automorphisms of G.

Remark 7.5.8. The word “genus” is due to Mislin [102], following an analogy due to Sullivan [129], and has nothing to do with the use of the word elsewhere in mathematics.

This depends on the general observation that homotopy pullbacks of homotopy pullbacks are homotopy pullbacks (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

It says that to check whether or not two maps are homotopic, it suffices to check whether or not they become homotopic after localization at each prime p.

Remark 8.3.7. We repeat Remark 7.2.2, since it applies verbatim here.

Much early work in the theory of localization focused on the concept of genus, which was introduced by Mislin [102] in the context of H-spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Having the homotopy type of a finite CW complex is not a generic property, by a counterexample of Mislin [103].

Theorem 8.5.8. The genus of HP ∞ is uncountably infinite. For comparison, McGibbon [96] computed the genus of the finite nilpotent projective spaces RP 2n+1 , CP n and HP n for 1 ≤ n < ∞. For these spaces X, he uses pullbacks over X to give the set G(X) a group structure and proves the following result. Theorem 8.5.9. Let n be a positive integer. (i) G(RP 2n+1 ) = 1, (ii) G(CP n ) = 1, (iii) G(HP n ) ∼ = Z/2 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Z/2, where the number of factors equals the number of primes p such that 2 ≤ p ≤ 2n − 1.

As in the case of nilpotent groups, asking how unique formal localizations are gives a starting point of the analysis of the extended genus, and one can then seek the actual genus inside that (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Rather tautologically, a major theme of algebraic topology is the algebraization of homotopy theory. In some cases, the algebraization is complete, and this is true for rational homotopy theory, as proven by Quillen [110] and Sullivan [130 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

we show how to give it more topological content via the Samelson product on homotopy groups.

Definition 9.2.1. An H-monoid is a homotopy associative H-space. An Hgroup is an H-monoid with a map χ providing inverses up to homotopy, so that µ ◦ (id ×χ) ◦ ∆ ≃ ∗ ≃ µ ◦ (χ × id) ◦ ∆, where ∗ denotes the trivial map at the unit element e and µ is the product (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

If we abuse notation by writing χ(x) = x −1 and writing µ(x, y) = xy, then the condition becomes “xx −1 = e = x −1 x” up to homotopy.

More elegantly, an H-space X is an H-monoid if the functor [−, X] is monoid– valued and is an H-group if the functor [−, X] is group–valued (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

This raises the question of whether or not there is a homotopical construction of a Lie bracket on π∗ (X) for an H-group X that is compatible under the Hurewicz homomorphism with the commutator in H∗ (X; Z).

For based spaces J and K, define the generalized Samelson product h−, −i : [J, X] ⊗ [K, X] −→ [J ∧ K, X] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

by hf, gi = [φ′ ◦(f ∧g)]. Specializing to J = S p and K = S q , this gives the Samelson product h−, −i : πp (X) ⊗ πq (X) −→ πp+q (X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

we briefly describe the Whitehead product, which is fundamental in the deeper parts of unstable homotopy theory and i (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

It is most easily defined as a special case of the Samelson product (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We rewrite this as [−, −] : [ΣJ, X] ⊗ [ΣK, X] −→ [Σ(J ∧ K), X] and call it the generalized Whitehead product. Taking Taking J = S p−1 and K = S q−1 , this specializes to the Whitehead product [−, −] : πp (X) ⊗ πq (X) −→ πp+q−1 (X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

From this point of view, the Whitehead product [ip , iq ] is thought of as a map S p+q−1 −→ S p ∨ S q , and it is the attaching map for the construction of S p × S q from S p ∨ S q .

The Whitehead products appear in the EHP-sequence, which is the most important tool for the study of unstable homotopy groups. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Thinking of spaces, homotopy types, and spaces in the same genus as analogous to animals, animals in the same species, and animals in the same genus, algebraic topologists are expert at genetic modification to produce different species in the same genus.

We usually modify spaces using finite sets I, especially partitions of the primes into two disjoint sets T1 and T2 . In that case, the local to global fraction results go under the name of Zabrodsky mixing (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

They constructed an H-space X that is in the same genus as the Lie group Sp(2) but is not equivalent to it. Both X and Sp(2) are equivalent to S 3 × S 7 away from the primes 2 and 3. As is explained in [60, pp. 122-127], the three H-spaces in sight, X, Sp(2) and S 3 × S 7 , are total spaces of bundles over S 7 with fiber S 3 , and every simply connected finite H-space with rational cohomology E[x3 , x7 ] is equivalent to the total space of such a bundle.

Theorem 9.4.6. Let X be a connected homotopy commutative finite H-space. Then X is homotopy equivalent to a torus T = (S 1 ) n for some n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

It is usual to focus on a single prime p, and there is no loss of information in doing so since completion at T is the product over p ∈ T of the completions at p, and similarly for all relevant algebraic invariants (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In contrast to localization, completions of abelian groups can sensibly be defined in different ways, and the most relevant definitions are not standard fare in basic graduate algebra courses (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma 10.1.2. When restricted to finitely generated abelian groups, the p-adic completion functor is exact (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

.1.1. p-adic completion. It is usual to define the completion of an abelian group A at a given prime p to be the p-adic completion ̂ Âp = lim(A/p r A), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 159</a>)</p>
This definition will not fully serve our purposes since p-adic completion is neither left nor right exact in general, and exactness properties are essential to connect up with the topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

When A = Z, we write Zp instead of Z Ẑ Ẑp for the ring of p-adic integers, and we abbreviate Z/nZ to Z/n. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Observe that the p-adic completion functor takes values (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Even if we restrict to finitely generated abelian groups, we notice one key point of difference between localization and completion. While a homomorphism of abelian groups between p-local groups is necessarily a map of Z(p) -modules, a homomorphism of abelian groups between p-adically complete abelian groups need not be a map of Zp -modules. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 160</a>)</p>
When A is finitely generated, p-adic completion is given by the map ψ : A −→ A⊗Zp specified by ψ(a) = a ⊗ 1, this again being a consequence of the Artin-Rees lemma (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Since Zp is torsion free, it is a flat Z-module, which gives us another way of seeing Lemma 10.1.2 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 160</a>)</p>
To overcome the lack of exactness of p-adic completion in general, we consider the left derived functors of the p-adic completion functor. For the knowledgable reader, we recall that left derived functors are usually defined only for right exact functors, in which case the 0th left derived functor agrees with the given functor (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=160" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 160</a>)</p>
The left derived functors of p-adic completion are given on an abelian group A by first taking a free resolution 0 −→ F ′ −→ F −→ A −→ 0 of A, then applying p-adic completion, and finally taking the homology of the resulting length two chain complex ̂p F̂ ′ p′ −→ ̂ F̂p (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 160</a>)</p>
Since kernels and cokernels of maps of Zp -modules are Zp -modules, since a free abelian group is its own free resolution, and since p-adic completion is exact when restricted to finitely generated abelian groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma 10.1.4. The functors L0 and L1 take values in Zp -modules. If A is either a finitely generated abelian group or a free abelian group, then L0 A = ̂ Âp , L1 A = 0, and φ : A −→ L0 A coincides with p-adic completion (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 160</a>)</p>
Definition 10.1.5. Fix a prime p. We say that the completion of A at p is defined if L1 A = 0, and we then define the completion of A at p to be the homomorphism φ : A −→ L0 A. We say that A is p-complete if φ : A −→ L0 A is an isomorphism. As we shall see in Proposition 10.1.18, if A is p-complete, then L1 A = 0 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Example 10.1.6.

Example 10.1.7. Zp ⊗ Zp and Z/p∞ (see below) are Zp -modules that are not p-complete (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The essential exactness property of our derived functors, which is proven in the same way as the long exact sequences for Tor and Ext, reads as follows (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Of course, Ep A = 0 if A is a divisible and hence injective abelian group. Write Hom(Z/pr , A) = Ar for brevity.

Notation 10.1.10. For a prime p and an abelian group A, define Ep A to be Ext(Z/p ∞ , A) and define Hp A to be Hom(Z/p ∞ , A). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In turn, Q/Z is isomorphic to the direct sum over all primes p of the groups Z/p ∞ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The group ̂ F̂p /F is uniquely p-divisible.

In view of Example 10.1.14, we have an interesting explicit example where homotopy groups shift dimension. Example 10.3.3.

One might naively hope that, at least if X is f -nilpotent, ̃ H̃∗ ( ̂ X̂T ; Z) might be isomorphic to ̃ H̃∗ (X; Z) ⊗ Z Ẑ ẐT , in analogy with what is true for localization.

However, using the characterization of completion in terms of mod p homology, we can obtain correct statements simply by completing the constructions that fail to be complete.

There is a large body of interesting work on p-complete H-spaces.

This notion was introduced and studied by Dwyer and Wilkerson [41], who showed how remarkably similar to compact Lie groups these X are. The completion of a compact Lie group is an example, but there are many others. Like compact Lie groups, p-compact groups have versions of maximal tori, normalizers of maximal tori, and Weyl groups. A complete classification, analogous to the classification of compact Lie groups, has recently been obtained (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Conceptually, the point is that the group theory knows only about Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces K(G, 1), but the topology knows how to use two-stage Postnikov towers to construct completions of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces K(G, 1) for nilpotent groups G that are not completable algebraically (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We begin by showing that completion preserves certain pullbacks. This is in contrast to the case of localization, where all pullbacks are preserved. Of course, the difference is a consequence of the failure of exactness for completion (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Lemma 12.2.1. If an abelian group A is completable at T , then the kernel of the completion φ̂ φ̂ : A → ET A is Hom(Z[T −1 ], A). If G is an f ZT -nilpotent group, then the completion φ̂ φ̂ : G → ET G is a monomorphism. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

It is natural to think of completion at p as the composite of localization at p and completion at p (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Our algebraic local to global result reads as follows. Its hypotheses seem to be minimal, but it is instructive to compare it with Theorem 13.3.1, where the topology allows us to generalize to groups that are not completable at T .

We first develop conditions on the input that ensure that our local to global fracture theorem delivers f Ẑ ẐT -nilpotent groups as output. This is subtle since finite generation conditions on the input are not always sufficient. There are finitely generated T -complete groups that cannot be realized as the completions of finitely generated T -local groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 12.4.6. The adèlic genus of a finitely generated nilpotent group G is the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated nilpotent groups G ′ such that G0 is isomorphic to G′ ′0 ′0 and ̂ Ĝp is isomorphic to ̂ Ĝ′ ′p ′p for all primes p. The complete genus of G is defined by dropping the requirement that G0 be isomorphic to G′ 0 0 . The name “adèlic” is suggested by Sullivan’s analogy [131, 129] with the theory of adèles in number theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The conclusion would be that the adèlic genus of G is in bijective correspondence with the double cosets Aut H\ Aut (J0 )/ Aut J (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The following general observation is elementary but important. It helps explain why one should expect to be able to reconstruct T -local spaces from their rationalizations and their completions at T . Lemma 13.2.1. Let f : X −→ Y be any map. Then f∗ : H∗ (X; ZT ) −→ H∗ (Y ; ZT ) is an isomorphism if and only if f∗ : H∗ (X; Q) −→ H∗ (Y ; Q) and, for all p ∈ T , f∗ : H∗ (X; Fp ) −→ H∗ (Y ; Fp ) are isomorphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Indeed, homology commutes with sums and colimits of coefficient groups since this already holds on the chain level. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We saw in §12.4 that the lack of a functorial formal completion of nilpotent groups impeded the naive analysis of the complete genus of f -nilpotent groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The idea is to form the tensor product of a space X and a ring R to obtain a space “X ⊗R” such that π∗ (X ⊗R) is naturally isomorphic to π∗ (X)⊗R. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Since we want tensoring over R to be an exact functor on abelian groups, we also insist that the underlying abelian group of R be torsion free. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

For any set of primes S ⊂ T , the localization of X at S can be thought of as X ⊗ ZS and the completion of X at S can be thought of as X ⊗ Ẑ ẐS . We didn’t need the finite type hypothesis to conclude that π∗ (XS ) ∼ = ∼ = π∗ (X) ⊗ ZS , but we did need it to conclude that π∗ ( ̂ X̂S ) ∼ = ∼ = π∗ (X) ⊗ Ẑ ẐS . In both cases, with our X ⊗ R notation, we started with K(A, n) ⊗ R = K(A ⊗ R, n) and inducted up the Postnikov tower of X to obtain the construction. We explain how the same construction goes in our more general situation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

When T is the empty set, the realification of rational spaces case has been studied using the algebraization of rational homotopy theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The difficulty is that, in this generality, the cohomology of the EilenbergMac Lane spaces K(B ⊗ R, n) can be quite badly behaved. Thus we may not have enough cohomological control to start and continue the induction (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Of course, it suffices to define the functor on countable CW complexes since we are working in homotopy categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remember that localizations and completions are defined by universal properties in the homotopy category and so are not uniquely specified (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 13.6.5. The adèlic genus of an f -nilpotent space X is the set of homotopy classes of f -nilpotent spaces Y such that X0 is equivalent to Y0 and X ̂ X̂p is isomorphic to Y ̂ Ŷp for all primes p. The complete genus of X is defined by dropping the requirement that X0 be isomorphic to Y0 . Write ̂ Ĝ0 (X) for the adèlic genus of X and ̂ Ĝ(X) for the complete genus. Recall that G(X) denotes the (local) genus of X. If two spaces are in the same local genus, they are in the same adèlic genus, and if two spaces are in the same adèlic genus they are in the same complete genus. Therefore we have inclusions G(X) ⊂ G ̂ Ĝ0 (X) ⊂ G ̂ Ĝ(X). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 13.6.6. For a simple space X of finite type, there is a canonical bijection between ̂ Ĝ0 (X) and the set of double cosets hAut(X0 )\hAut(F X0 )/hAut(F X).

Theorem 13.6.7. If X is a simply connected finite CW complex, then ̂ Ĝ(X) and therefore ̂ Ĝ0 (X) and G(X) are finite sets. It is natural to ask if these three notions of genus are genuinely different (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Recall that the function space F (X, Y ) is nilpotent when X is finite and Y is of finite type (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Taking Y = X, this suggests that the automorphism groups above should be nilpotent, or nearly so, when X is finite and that their analysis should be closely related to the algebraic analysis of the genus of a finitely generated nilpotent group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem 13.6.8. Let X be an f -nilpotent space. If X0 admits an H-space structure, then ̂ Ĝ0 (X) = ̂ Ĝ(X). If, further, X is either π∗ -finite or H∗ -finite, then G(X) = ̂ Ĝ(X). However, there are simply connected examples such that ̂ Ĝ0 (X) 6= ̂ Ĝ(X), and these can be chosen to be π∗ -finite or H∗ -finite. Similarly, there are simply connected examples such that G(X) 6= ̂ Ĝ0 (X), and these too can be chosen to be π∗ -finite or H∗ -finite (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Say that X is π∗ -finite or H∗ -finite if it has only finitely many non-zero homotopy groups or only finitely many non-zero homology groups, all of them assumed to be finitely generated (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Model category theory is due to Quillen [112]. Nice introductions are given in [40, 51], and there are two expository books on the subject [63, 64] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In fact, by now the very term “homotopy theory” admits of two interpretations. There is the homotopy theory of topological spaces, which is the core of algebraic topology, and there is also homotopy theory as a general methodology applicable to many other subjects (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let M be a category. We insist that categories have sets of morphisms between pairs of objects; category theorists would say that M is locally small. Similarly, we understand limits and colimits to be small, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

respect to functors out of small categories D. We assume once and for all that M is bicomplete. This means that M is complete (has all limits) and cocomplete (has all colimits). In particular, it has an initial object ∅ and a terminal object ∗ (the coproduct and product of the empty set of objects). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

A model structure on M consists of three interrelated classes of maps (W , C , F ), called the weak equivalences, the cofibrations, and the fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 214</a>)</p>
homotopy category HoM that is obtained by inverting the weak equivalences. This is a localization process that is analogous to the localization of rings at multiplicatively closed subsets, and it is characterized by an analogous universal property. Formally, this means that there must be a functor γ : M −→ HoM such that γ(w) is an isomorphism if w ∈ W and γ is initial with respect to this property.

One might attempt to construct HoM by means of words in the morphisms of M and formal inverses of the morphisms of W , but the result of such a construction is not locally small in general (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The following observation is often applied to classical homotopy categories, where it shows that a retract of a homotopy equivalence is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Transfinite colimits play a substantial role in the foundational literature of model category theory, and they are crucial to the construction of Bousfield localizations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 14.1.7. Let L be a class of maps in M . We say that L is left saturated if the following (redundant) closure properties hold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 14.1.10. An ordered pair (L , R) of classes of morphisms of M factors M if every morphism f : X −→ Y factors as a composite X i(f ) / Z(f ) p(f ) /Y with i(f ) ∈ L and p(f ) ∈ R.

Mapping cylinders and mapping path fibrations [89, pp 43, 48] give the original source for the following idea, but it also arises from analogous categorical contexts. Definition 14.1.11. A weak factorization system (WFS) of M is an ordered pair (L , R) of classes of morphisms of M that factors M and satisfies both L = R and R = L  (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The required equalities say that the maps in L are precisely the maps that have the LLP with respect to the maps in R and the maps in R are precisely the maps that have the RLP with respect to the maps in L .

Category theorists also study strong factorization systems, for which the relevant lifts λ are required to be unique. 3 The difference is analogous to the difference between the class of fibrations and the class of covering maps as the choice of R.

Definition 14.2.1. A model structure on M consists of classes (W , C , F ) of morphisms of M , the weak equivalences, cofibrations, and fibrations, such that (i) W has the two out of three property. (ii) (C , F ∩ W ) is a (functorial) weak factorization system. (iii) (C ∩ W , F ) is a (functorial) weak factorization system. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The maps in F ∩ W are called acyclic (or trivial) fibrations; those in C ∩ W are called acyclic (or trivial) cofibrations. The definition requires every map to factor both as the composite of a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration and as an acyclic cofibration followed by a fibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It also requires there to be a lift in any commutative square A i  E p  X > ~> ~ ~ ~ /B in which i is a cofibration, p is a fibration, and either i or p is acyclic (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 218</a>)</p>
By (14.2.2) and (14.2.3, to specify a model structure on a category with a chosen class of weak equivalences that satisfies the two out of three property, we need only specify either the cofibrations or the fibrations, not both (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

(14.2.4) C  (F ∩ W ) and F  (C ∩ W ). It is usual to define model categories by requiring (14.2.4) and requiring F , C , and W to be closed under retracts. The following observation (due to Joyal) shows that our axioms imply that W is closed under retracts and are therefore equivalent to the usual ones (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 219</a>)</p>
Lemma 14.2.5. The class W as well as the classes C , C ∩ W , F , and F ∩ W in a model structure are subcategories that contain all isomorphisms and are closed under retracts. Therefore W is a subcategory of weak equivalences in the sense of Definition 14.1.4. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 14.2.7. An object X of a model category M is cofibrant if the unique map ∅ −→ X is a cofibration. An acyclic fibration q : QX −→ X in which QX is cofibrant is called a cofibrant approximation or cofibrant replacement 5 of X. We can obtain q by factoring ∅ −→ X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 220</a>)</p>
Given two cofibrant replacements q : QX −→ X and q ′ : Q′ X −→ X, the lifting property gives a weak equivalence ξ : QX −→ Q′ X such that q ′ ◦ ξ = q (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In many model categories, either all objects are fibrant or all objects are cofibrant (but rarely both). For example, all objects are fibrant in the model structures that we shall define on U , and all objects are cofibrant in the usual model structure on simplicial sets (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For example, the following result becomes especially helpful when all objects are cofibrant or all objects are fibrant. Lemma 14.2.9 (Ken Brown’s lemma). Let F : M −→ N be a functor, where M is a model category and N is a category with a subcategory of weak equivalences. If F takes acyclic cofibrations between cofibrant objects to weak equivalences, then F takes all weak equivalences between cofibrant objects to weak equivalences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

in most examples there is a familiar and classical notion of a homotopy between maps. It is defined in terms of canonical cylinder and path objects, such as X × I and Map(I, X) in the case of spaces. Quillen [112] developed a notion of homotopy in general model categories and showed how to derive many familiar results using the model theoretic notion.

Definition 14.3.1. A cylinder object for X ∈ M is an object Cyl X together with maps i0 : X −→ Cyl X, i1 : X −→ Cyl X, and p : Cyl (X) −→ X such that p ◦ i0 = id = p ◦ i1 and p is a weak equivalence; by the two out of three property, i0 and i1 are also weak equivalences. A cylinder object is good if the map i = i0 + i1 : X ∐ X −→ Cyl (X) is a cofibration. A good cylinder object Cyl (X) is very good if p is an acyclic fibration. Factorization of the folding map X ∐ X −→ X shows that every X has at least one very good cylinder object. A left homotopy between maps f, g : X −→ Y is a map h : Cyl (X) −→ Y such that h ◦ i0 = f and (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Lemma 14.3.3. If h is a left homotopy from f to g and either f or g is a weak equivalence, then so is the other. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We emphasize that the definition of left homotopy allows the use of any cylinder object and that the notion of left homotopy and its good and very good variants are not equivalence relations in general (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Even in some categories with canonical cylinders, such as the category of simplicial sets, homotopy is not an equivalence relation in general (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

For example, in the standard model structure on topological spaces of §17.2, X × I is a cylinder object, but it is not good unless X is cofibrant, and similarly for categories of chain complexes.

Perhaps the real force of Quillen’s approach to homotopies is the comparison between left and right homotopies. Proposition 14.3.11. Consider maps f, g : X −→ Y .

Definition 14.3.12. When X is cofibrant and Y is fibrant, we say that f is homotopic to g, written f ≃ g, if f is left or, equivalently, right homotopic to g.

Thus we have a kind of point set level naturality of q and r even when we do not have functors Q and R (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The class of maps f such that γ(f ) is an isomorphism is precisely W , and every map in HoM is a composite of morphisms in γ(M ) and inverses of morphisms in γ(W ).

In any category C , a map f : A −→ B is an isomorphism if and only if either f∗ : C (C, A) −→ C (C, B) or f ∗ : C (B, C) −→ C (A, C) is an isomorphism for one C in each isomorphism class of objects in C .

It is important to understand when functors defined on M are homotopy invariant, in the sense that they take homotopic maps to the same map. There are three results along this line, the most obvious of which is the least useful. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Lemma 14.4.9. Any functor F : M −→ H that takes weak equivalences to isomorphisms identifies left or right homotopic maps. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

However, the hypothesis on F here is too strong and rarely holds in practice. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

There is a standard construction of WFS’s and model categories, which is based on Quillen’s “small object argument”. The latter is a general method for starting with a set, I say, of maps of M and constructing from I a functorial WFS ( (I  ), I  ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=231" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 231</a>)</p>
The small object argument is often repeated in the model category literature, but it admits a useful variant that we feel has not been sufficiently emphasized in print. 1 We call the variant the compact object argument (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=231" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 231</a>)</p>
In many basic examples, such as topological spaces, chain complexes, and simplicial sets, only sequential colimits are required. When this is the case, we obtain a more concrete type of cofibrantly generated model category called a compactly generated model category. In such cases we are free to ignore transfinite cell complexes. Compactly generated model categories are attractive to us since the relevant cell theory is much closer to classical cell theory in algebraic topology (e.g. [89]) and in homological algebra (e.g. [74]) than the transfinite version (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=231" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 231</a>)</p>
We feel that the general case of cofibrantly generated model categories is overemphasized in the model category literature, and we urge the reader not to get bogged down in the details of the requisite smallness condition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We describe model structures in over and under “slice categories” in §15.3. This gives a frequently used illustration of how one creates new model structures from given ones (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 231</a>)</p>
The essential starting point is to define I-cell complexes. When I is the set {S n −→ Dn+1 } of standard cell inclusions, all CW complexes will be examples of I-cell complexes as we define them (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 232</a>)</p>
Remark 15.1.12. There is a general property of a category, called local presentability [12, §5.2], that ensures that any set I permits the small object argument. In such categories, this leads to a more uniform and aesthetically satisfactory treatment of the small object argument. It is satisfied by most algebraically defined categories. It is not satisfied by the category of compactly generated topological spaces. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 236</a>)</p>
However, if instead of using all compact Hausdorff spaces in the definition of compactly generated spaces [89, p. 37], one only uses standard simplices, one obtains the locally presentable category of “combinatorial spaces”. It appears that one can redo all of algebraic topology with combinatorial spaces replacing compactly generated spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 15.2.1. A model category M is cofibrantly generated if there are (small) sets I and J of maps such that C = C (I) and C ∩W = C (J ) and therefore F = J  and F ∩W = I  . The sets I and J are called the generating cofibrations and generating acyclic cofibrations. We say that M is compactly generated if, further, I and J are compact, in which case only ordinary sequential cell complexes are needed to define C (I) and C (J ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Remark 15.2.2. A combinatorial model category is a locally presentable category that is also a cofibrantly generated model category [9]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 236</a>)</p>
For example, Theorem 15.2.3 is often used to transport a model structure across an adjunction, as we formalize in Theorem 16.2.5 below, and then only the acyclicity condition need be verified (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 237</a>)</p>
The acyclicity condition clearly holds if J ⊂ W and W is a left saturated class of maps in the sense of Definition 14.1.7. This rarely applies since pushouts of weak equivalences are generally not weak equivalences. However, pushouts of coproducts of maps in J often are weak equivalences, and verifying that is usually the key step in verifying the acyclicity condition.

Definition 15.3.1. Let M be a category and B be an object of M .

Definition 15.4.1. A model category M is left proper if the pushout of a weak equivalence along a cofibration is a weak equivalence.

Over and under model structures often play a helpful technical role in proofs, as is well illustrated by their use in the proof of the following result. One point is that appropriate maps can be viewed as cofibrant or fibrant objects in model categories, allowing us to apply results about such objects to maps.

Proposition 15.4.2. Let M be a model category. Then any pushout of a weak equivalence between cofibrant objects along a cofibration is a weak equivalence, hence M is left proper if every object of M is cofibrant (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 15.4.3. A model category M satisfies the left gluing lemma if, for any commutative diagram A f C i o g k /B h A ′ o C ′ j o ℓ B′ in which i and j are cofibrations and f , g, and h are weak equivalences, the induced map of pushouts A ∪C B −→ A ′ ∪C ′ B ′ is a weak equivalence.

In our examples, we sometimes prove the gluing lemma directly, because it is no more difficult. However, in deeper examples it is often easier to check that the model structure is left proper and to use the previous result to deduce that the left gluing lemma holds (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

of hom sets in HoM . We describe how we can sometimes deduce that i ∗ is a bijection directly from lifting properties and, conversely, how we can sometimes deduce lifting properties when i ∗ is a bijection. While i will be a cofibration and Z will be fibrant, the force of these results comes from the fact that the relevant lifting properties concern pairs of maps, neither of which need be a weak equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

we describe the 2-categorical way of understanding the passage to derived homotopy categories and we explain that double categories, rather than categories or 2-categories, give the appropriate conceptual framework for understanding maps between model categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

One small point that deserves more emphasis than it receives in the literature is that there is a familiar classical notion of homotopy in the enriched categories that appear in nature, and the model categorical notion of homotopy and the classical notion of homotopy can be used interchangably in such contexts.

We say that a functor F : M −→ N between categories with weak equivalences is homotopical if it takes weak equivalences to weak equivalences, and we say that a functor F : M −→ HoN or more generally a functor F : M −→ H for any other category H is homotopical if it takes weak equivalences to isomorphisms.

. The universal property of localization then gives a functor ̃ F̃ : HoM −→ HoN in the first case or ̃ F̃ : HoM −→ H in the general case (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The functor ̃ F̃ is a derived functor of F . However, this will not suffice for the applications. As we have already said, most functors F that we encounter are not homotopical, and then it is too much to expect that diagrams such as those above commute; rather, we often obtain diagrams like these that commute up to a natural transformation that is characterized by a universal property (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 248</a>)</p>
We note parenthetically that there are also functors that in some sense deserve the name of a derived functor and yet are neither left nor right derived in the sense we are about to define. The theory of such functors is not well understood, but they appear in applications (e.g. [93]) and have been given a formal description in [124]. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 16.1.1. A left derived functor of a functor F : M −→ H is a functor LF : HoM −→ H together with a natural transformation µ : LF ◦ γ −→ F such that for any functor K : HoM −→ H and natural transformation ξ : K ◦γ −→ F , there is a unique natural transformation σ : K −→ LF such that the composite µ ◦ (σ · γ) : K ◦ γ −→ LF ◦ γ −→ F coincides with ξ. That is, (LF, µ) is terminal among pairs (K, ξ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We use · to denote the composite of a natural transformation and a functor; categorically, that is often called whiskering (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 248</a>)</p>
Since left derived functors are characterized by a universal property, they are unique up to canonical isomorphism if they exist. Confusingly, they are examples of what are known categorically as right Kan extensions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 16.1.3. If F : M −→ H takes acyclic cofibrations between cofibrant objects to isomorphisms, then the left derived functor (LF, µ) exists. Moreover, for any cofibrant object X of M , µ : LF X −→ F X is an isomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 16.2.1. Let F : M −→ N and U : N −→ M be left and right adjoint. The pair (F, U ) is a Quillen adjunction if the following equivalent conditions are satisfied.

Ponto 251</a>)</p>
The Quillen adjunction (F, U ) is a Quillen equivalence if for any map f : F X −→ Y with adjoint g : X −→ U Y , where X is cofibrant and Y is fibrant, f is a weak equivalence in N if and only if g is a weak equivalence in M .

Many of the applications concern adjunctions (F, U ) where F specifies free structured objects (such as monoids, algebras, etc) and U forgets the structure on these objects.

Ponto 251</a>)</p>
Proposition 16.2.2. If (F, U ) is a Quillen adjunction, then the total derived functors LF and RU exist and form an adjoint pair. If (F, U ) is a Quillen equivalence, then (LF, RU ) is an adjoint equivalence between HoM and HoN . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 251</a>)</p>
The criterion of Proposition 16.2.3(v) is especially useful since a standard way to build a model category structure on N is to use an adjunction (F, U ) to create it from a model structure on M , setting WN = U −1 (WM ) and FN = U −1 (FM ). The following result, which is [63, 11.3.2], is frequently used for this purpose. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

More deeply, it masks one of the greatest difficulties of model category theory and of the theory of derived functors in general. Good properties of left adjoints are preserved under composition of left adjoints. However, it is in practice very often necessary to compose left adjoints with right adjoints. Results about such composites are hard to come by. They are often truly deep mathematics. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

However, the categorical considerations of greatest relevance to the applications of model category theory concern enrichment from hom sets to hom objects (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A monoidal structure on a category V is a product, ⊗ say, and a unit object I such that the product is associative and unital up to coherent natural isomorphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Informally, coherence means that diagrams that intuitively should commute do in fact commute. (The symmetry coherence admits a weakening that gives braided monoidal categories, but those will not concern us.) A symmetric monoidal category V is closed if it has internal hom objects V (X, Y ) in V together with adjunction isomorphisms V (X ⊗ Y, Z) ∼ = ∼ = V (X, V (Y, Z)). These isomorphisms of hom sets imply isomorphisms of internal hom objects in V V (X ⊗ Y, Z) ∼ = ∼ = V (X, V (Y, Z)). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 254</a>)</p>
From now on, we let V be a bicomplete closed symmetric monoidal category. Such categories appear so often in nature that category theorists have invented a name for them: such a category is often called a “cosmos”. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

When ⊗ is the cartesian product, we say that V is cartesian closed, but the same category V can admit other symmetric monoidal structures (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

(i) The category Set of sets is closed cartesian monoidal. (ii) The category U of (compactly generated) spaces is cartesian closed. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The category U∗ of based spaces is closed symmetric monoidal under the smash product. The smash product would not be associative if we used just spaces, rather than compactly generated spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The category sSet of simplicial sets is cartesian closed. A simplicial set is a contravariant functor ∆ −→ Set, where ∆ is the category of sets n = {0, 1, · · · , n} and monotonic maps. There are n-simplices ∆[n] in sSet, and n 7→ ∆[n] gives a covariant functor ∆ −→ sSet (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

For a commutative ring R, the category MR of R-modules is closed symmetric monoidal under the functors ⊗R and HomR ; in particular, the category Ab of abelian groups is closed symmetric monoidal (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For a commutative ring R, the category ChR of Z-graded chain complexes of R-modules (with differential lowering degree) is closed symmetric monoidal under the graded tensor product and hom functors (X ⊗R Y )n = Σp+q=n Xp ⊗R Yq ; d(x ⊗ y) = d(x) ⊗ y + (−1) p x ⊗ d(y). HomR (X, Y )n = Πi HomR (Xi , Yi+n ); d(f )i = d ◦ fi − (−1) n fi−1 ◦ d. Here the symmetry γ : X ⊗ Y −→ Y ⊗ X is defined with a sign, γ(x ⊗ y) = (−1) pq y ⊗ x for x ∈ Xp and y ∈ Yq .

The category Cat of small categories is cartesian closed (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 16.3.3. Let V be a symmetric monoidal category. A V -category M , or a category M enriched over V , consists of (i) a class of objects, with typical objects denoted X, Y , Z; (ii) for each pair of objects (X, Y ), a hom object M (X, Y ) in V ; (iii) for each object X, a unit map idX : I −→ M (X, X) in V ; (iv) for each triple of objects (X, Y, Z), a composition morphism in V M (Y, Z) ⊗ M (X, Y ) −→ M (X, Z).

Categories as usually defined are categories enriched in Set. (ii) Categories enriched in Ab are called Ab-categories. They are called additive categories if they have zero objects and biproducts [77, p. 196]. They are called abelian categories if, further, all maps have kernels and cokernels, every monomorphism is a kernel, and every epimorphism is a cokernel (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

(iii) Categories enriched in U are called topological categories. (iv) Categories enriched in sSet are called simplicial categories. (v) Categories enriched in ChR for some R are called DG-categories. (vi) Categories enriched in Cat are called (strict) 2-categories and, inductively, categories enriched in the cartesian monoidal category of (n − 1)-categories are called (strict) n-categories.

For any ring R, not necessarily commutative, the category of left R-modules is abelian (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Most of the model category literature focuses on simplicial categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

However, there are important enriched categorical notions that take account of the extra structure given by the enrichment and are not just reinterpretations of ordinary categorical notions. In particular, there are weighted (or indexed) colimits and limits. The most important of these (in non-standard notation) are tensors X ⊙V (sometimes called copowers) and cotensors (sometimes called powers) Φ(V, X) in M for objects X ∈ M and V ∈ V . These are characterized by natural isomorphisms (16.3.6) M (X ⊙ V, Y ) ∼ = ∼ = V (V, M (X, Y )) ∼ = ∼ = M (X, Φ(V, Y )) of hom sets. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The functor V (I, −) is a right adjoint and therefore preserves limits, such as pullbacks; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We have defined categories enriched in a symmetric monoidal category V , and we have observed that one such V is the cartesian monoidal category Cat, the category of categories and functors (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 262</a>)</p>
We have also observed that a category enriched in Cat is called a 2-category. An example is Cat itself. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 262</a>)</p>
We think of functors as morphisms between categories and natural transformations as morphisms between functors. We also have two 2-categories ModCatℓ and ModCatr of model categories. Their objects (or 0-cells) are model categories, their morphisms (or 1-cells) are Quillen left adjoints and Quillen right adjoints, respectively, and their morphisms between morphisms (or 2-cells) are natural transformations in both cases. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

A pseudo-functor F : C −→ D between 2-categories (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

assigns 0-cells, 1-cells, and 2-cells in D to 0-cells, 1-cells, and 2-cells in C . For each fixed pair X, Y of 0-cells, F specifies a functor C (X, Y ) −→ D(FX, FY ). However, for 0-cells X, F(IdX ) need not equal IdFX and, for composable 1-cells F and G, F(G ◦ F ) need not equal FG ◦ FF . Rather, there are 2-cell isomorphisms connecting these. These isomorphisms are subject to coherence axioms asserting that certain associativity and left and right unity diagrams commute (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 16.5.1. Passage from model categories to their derived homotopy categories HoM , derived functors, and derived natural transformations specify pseudo-functors L : ModCatℓ −→ Cat and R : ModCatr −→ Cat.

The proper framework is given by viewing model categories as forming not a pair of 2-categories, but rather as a single double category (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Just as we can define a category enriched in any symmetric monoidal category V , we can define an internal category in any complete category V . It has object and morphism objects Ob and Mor in V together with maps S, T : Mor −→ Ob, I : Ob −→ Mor, and C : Mor ×Ob Mor −→ Mor in V , called source, target, identity, and composition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 263</a>)</p>
An ordinary category is an internal category in the category of sets. Internal categories in the category U of topological spaces appear frequently. A double category is just an internal category in Cat. A 2-category can be viewed as a double category whose object category is discrete, meaning that it has only identity morphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 263</a>)</p>
It has 0-cells, namely the objects of the category Ob, it has both “vertical” and “horizontal” 1-cells, namely the morphisms of Ob and the objects of Mor, and it has 2-cells, namely the morphisms of Mor.

Ponto 263</a>)</p>
Thus let M be a category with a subcategory W of weak equivalences. We form a double category D(M , W ) whose objects are the objects of M , whose horizontal and vertical 1-cells are the morphisms of M and of W , and whose 2-cells are commutative diagrams X f v Y w  X ′ g / Y′ in which v, w ∈ W . Thinking in terms of the arrow category of M , we can view this square as a morphism v −→ w between vertical arrows or as a morphism f −→ g between horizontal arrows.

Ponto 264</a>)</p>
The reason for introducing this language is that it gives a way of expressing L and R as part of a single kind of functor, namely a double pseudofunctor F : D −→ E between double categories. Such an F assigns 0-cells, vertical 1-cells, horizontal 1-cells, and 2-cells in D to the corresponding kinds of cells in C . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Corollary 16.5.4. If F is both a Quillen left adjoint and a Quillen right adjoint, then LF ∼ = ∼ RF . = The real force of Theorem 16.5.3 concerns the comparisons it induces between composites of left and right derived adjoint base change functors (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Theorem 16.5.3. Model categories are the 0-cells of a double category Mod whose vertical and horizontal 1-cells are the Quillen left and right adjoints and whose 2-cells are the natural transformations. There is a double pseudofunctor F : Mod −→ Q(Cat) such that Fv = L and Fh = R. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 264</a>)</p>
This result encodes many relationships between left and right Quillen adjoints in a form that is familiar in other categorical contexts. The Quillen adjunctions (F, U ) are examples of the correct categorical notion of an adjunction in a double category, called a conjunction in (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 264</a>)</p>
The central point we want to make is that there are three intertwined model structures on the relevant categories, and that the least familiar, which is called the mixed model structure and was introduced relatively recently by Michael Cole [31], is in some respects the most convenient (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In fact, we shall argue that algebraic topologists, from the very beginning of the subject, have by preference worked implicitly in the mixed model structure on topological spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The most obvious homotopical notion of a weak equivalence is an actual homotopy equivalence. We call such maps h-equivalences for short. It is natural to expect there to be a model category structure on the category U of compactly generated spaces in which the weak equivalences are the h-equivalences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The cofibrations are the maps i : A −→ X that satisfy the homotopy extension property (HEP) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The fibrations are the maps p : E −→ B that satisfy the covering homotopy property (CHP). This means that for all spaces A they satisfy the RLP with respect to the inclusion i0 : A −→ A × I.

call these Hurewicz cofibrations and Hurewicz fibrations, conveniently abbreviated to h-cofibrations and h-fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

These cofibrations and fibrations were not considered by Quillen in his paper introducing model categories [112], but Strøm [128] later proved a version of the following result. Technically, he worked in the category of all spaces, not just the compactly generated ones, and in that category the model theoretic cofibrations are the Hurewicz cofibrations that are closed inclusions. However, as we left as an exercise in [89, p. 46], the Hurewicz cofibrations in U are closed inclusions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 17.1.1 (h-model structure). The category U is a monoidal model category whose weak equivalences, cofibrations, and fibrations, denoted (Wh , Ch , Fh ), are the h-equivalences, h-cofibrations, and h-fibrations. All spaces are both h-fibrant and h-cofibrant, hence this model structure is proper (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Corollary 17.1.2. The category U∗ of based spaces in U is a proper model category whose weak equivalences, cofibrations, and fibrations are the based maps that are h-equivalences, h-cofibrations, and h-fibrations when regarded as maps in U . The pair (T, U ), where T is given by adjoining disjoint basepoints and U is the forgetful functor, is a Quillen adjunction relating U to U∗ . Moreover, U∗ is a monoidal model category with respect to the smash product. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remark 17.1.3. In the first half of the book, we worked thoughout in the category T of nondegenerately based spaces in U . These are precisely the hcofibrant objects in the h-model category of all based spaces. There is an elementary cofibrant approximation functor, called whiskering.

The left adjoint (−) × I commutes with colimits (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We have completed the proof that U is a model category (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In the first half of the book, we assumed that all spaces had the homotopy types of CW-complexes. Therefore there was no distinction between a homotopy equivalence and a weak homotopy equivalence. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Note that the most natural kind of based cell complexes would start with based cells S n −→ Dn+1 for chosen basepoints of spheres and would have based attaching maps. While such cell complexes are useful, they can only model connected based spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

When we specialize to spaces, the statements in the rest of the section give model theoretic refinements of classical results, and the reader may wish to skip to the next section, referring back to this one as needed. For example, the first part of the following result refines the Whitehead theorem that a weak equivalence between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=272" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 272</a>)</p>
Therefore the category of CW homotopy types in T used in the first half of this book is the full subcategory of the category U∗ whose objects are the mcofibrant based spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It has long been accepted that the q-equivalences give the definitively right weak equivalences for classical homotopy theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The fibrations most frequently used in practice are the Hurewicz fibrations rather than the Serre fibrations. There are good reasons for this. For example, Hurewicz fibrations, but not Serre fibrations, are determined locally, in the sense of the following result (e.g. [84, 3.8]). It generalizes a theorem of Hurewicz [67]. Theorem 17.4.4. Let p : E −→ B be a surjective map and assume that B has a numerable open cover {U } such that each restriction p−1 U −→ U is an h-fibration. Then p is an h-fibration. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 278</a>)</p>
The proof uses the characterization of h-fibrations in terms of path lifting functions [89, §7.2], and that characterization itself often gives an easy way of checking that a map is an h-fibration. Paradoxically, this means that it is often easiest to prove that a map is a q-fibration by proving the stronger statement that it is an h-fibration (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=278" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 278</a>)</p>
These considerations argue for the h-fibrations, Fh , as our preferred subcategory of fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 278</a>)</p>
The mixed model structure has all of the good formal properties of the q-model structure. It is almost certainly not cofibrantly generated, but that is irrelevant to the applications (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 278</a>)</p>
Any map with the name cofibration should at least be a classical Hurewicz cofibration, and an m-cofibration is an h-cofibration that is a q-cofibration up to homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Proposition 17.3.4(i) generalizes the relative version of the Whitehead theorem that a weak equivalence between cell complexes is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 278</a>)</p>
Cell complexes are more general than CW complexes, but any cell complex is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. Therefore, in the mixed model structure, we can use cell and CW complexes interchangeably (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=279" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 279</a>)</p>
One is to first approximate any space X by a weakly equivalent CW complex, (e.g. [89, §10.5]), and then use the Whitehead theorem (e.g. [89, §10.3]) to show that any cell approximation of X is homotopy equivalent to the constructed CW approximation. The other is to inductively deform any given cell complex to a homotopy equivalent CW complex by cellular approximation of its attaching maps. The geometric realization of the total singular complex of X gives a particularly nice functorial CW approximation (e.g. [89, §16.2]), and it is a functorial cofibrant approximation in both the q and the m-model structures. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=279" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 279</a>)</p>
A central reason for preferring the m to the q-model structure is that it is generally quite hard to check whether or not a given space is actually homeomorphic to a cell or CW complex, whereas there are powerful classical theorems that characterize spaces of the homotopy types of CW complexes. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=279" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 279</a>)</p>
For an elementary example of this, there are many contractible spaces that cannot be homeomorphic to cell complexes; cones on badly behaved spaces give examples (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Although the standard model structure on simplicial sets is very convenient and useful, the proofs that it is indeed a model structure are notoriously involved (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The senior author has long believed that simpler proofs should be possible (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In retrospect, each gives a fibrant replacement functor on simplicial sets with unusually nice properties: both of these functors preserve fibrations and finite limits. Our proof of the model axioms requires use of these properties, but it is irrelevant which of the functors we use. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Our starting point is the following definition, part (iii) of which is not but ought to be the standard definition of a weak equivalence of simplicial sets (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 17.5.1. Let f : X −→ Y be a map of simplicial sets. (i) f is a cofibration if the map fq : Xq −→ Yq of q-simplices is an injection for each q; equivalently, f is a categorical monomorphism. In particular, every simplicial set is cofibrant. (ii) f is a fibration if it is a Kan fibration. This means that f satisfies the RLP with respect to all horns Λ k [n] −→ ∆[n]. In particular, the fibrant objects are the Kan complexes. (iii) f is a weak equivalence if f ∗ : π(Y, Z) −→ π(X, Z) is a bijection for all Kan complexes Z. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Let (T, S) denote the adjoint pair between S and U given by geometric realization and the total singular complex; T X is usually denoted |X|, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 280</a>)</p>
Note that in contrast with spaces, homotopy groups do not enter into the definition of weak equivalences. One reason is that they are not easily defined for general simplicial sets. However, they admit a direct combinatorial definition for Kan complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=280" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 280</a>)</p>
The equivalence of (ii) and (iii) is formal. Since the Kan complexes are the bifibrant objects in S , this result should be viewed as the simplicial analogue of the Whitehead theorem that a weak equivalence between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=281" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 281</a>)</p>
Lemma 17.5.5. The functor S takes spaces to Kan complexes, takes Serre fibrations to Kan fibrations, and preserves limits (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Lemma 17.5.6. The functor T preserves finite limits, hence so does the composite functor ST . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Theorem 17.5.10. For a Kan complex X, the unit η : X −→ ST X of the adjunction is a combinatorial weak equivalence and therefore a homotopy equivalence. Corollary 17.5.11. For a space Y , the counit ε : T SY −→ Y of the adjunction is a q-equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 282</a>)</p>
Proof. As with any adjunction, the composite SY η / ST SY Sε SY is the identity map (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Corollary 17.5.13. For any simplicial set X, the unit η : X −→ ST X is a weak equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 17.5.12 means that the left adjoint T creates the weak equivalences in S . In most other adjoint pair situations, it is the right adjoint that creates the weak equivalences. The difference is central to the relative difficulty in proving the model category axioms in S . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

As a left adjoint, T preserves all colimits (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=284" target="_blank">J. P. May & K. Ponto 284</a>)</p>
Remark 17.6.7. There is no h-model structure on simplicial sets in the literature, and it does not seem sensible to try to define one. One point is just that the unit interval simplicial set I = ∆[1] is asymmetric and the obvious notion of homotopy is not an equivalence relation. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Again, as in topology, we believe that the m-model structure is central and deserves much more attention than it has received in the literature (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The category ChR is bicomplete. Limits and colimits in ChR are just limits and colimits of the underlying R-modules, constructed degreewise, with the naturally induced differentials. Here we use the term R-module for a graded R-module, without differentials (or with differential identically zero). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Recall from §16.3 that a cosmos is a bicomplete closed symmetric monoidal category. The category ChZ is a cosmos under ⊗ and Hom (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 289</a>)</p>
The category ChR is enriched, tensored and cotensored over ChZ . The chain complex of morphisms X −→ Y is HomR (X, Y ), where HomR (X, Y ) is the subcomplex of Hom(X, Y ) consisting of those maps f that are maps of underlying R-modules. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 289</a>)</p>
Observe that since the zero module 0 is both an initial and terminal object in ChR , the analogy to make is with based rather than unbased spaces. For n ∈ Z, we define S n , the n-sphere chain complex, to be Z concentrated in degree n with zero differential. For any integer n, we define the n-fold suspension Σn X of an R-chain complex X to be X ⊗ S n . Thus (Σn X)n+q ∼ = Xq . The notation is motivated by the observation that if we define πn (X) to be the abelian group of chain homotopy classes of maps S n −→ X (ignoring the R-module structure), then πn (X) = Hn (X). The motto is that homology is a special case of homotopy and that homological algebra is a special case of homotopical algebra. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We used the notations ⊙ and Φ for tensors and cotensors earlier, but we will use ⊗ and Hom here, where these again mean ⊗Z and HomZ (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Analogously, we define D n+1 to be the (n + 1)-disk chain complex. It is Z in degrees n and n + 1 and zero in all other degrees. There is only one differential that can be non-zero, and we choose that differential to be the identity map Z −→ Z. The copy of Z in degree n is identified with S n and is quite literally the boundary of Dn+1 . We agree to write SR n R n+1 = R ⊗ S n and DR R = R ⊗ Dn+1 .

We define I to be the cellular chains of the unit interval. It is the chain complex with one basis element [I] in degree 1, two basis elements [0] and [1] in degrees 0, and differential d([I]) = [0] − [1]. We define a homotopy f ≃ g between maps of R-chain complexes X −→ Y to be a map of R-chain complexes h : X ⊗ I −→ Y that restricts to f and g on X ⊗ [0] and Y ⊗ [1].

In ChR , coproducts are direct sums and the pushout of maps f : A −→ X and g : A −→ Y is the “difference cokernel” (X ⊕ Y )/Im(f − g). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

We have two natural categories of weak equivalences in ChR . The h-equivalences are the homotopy equivalences of R-chain complexes, and the q-equivalences are the quasi-isomorphisms, namely those maps of R-chain complexes that induce an isomorphism on passage to the homology of the underlying chain complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We let hChR denote the ordinary homotopy category of ChR and call it the classical homotopy category of ChR .

Definition 18.2.1. An h-cofibration is a map i : A −→ X in ChR that satisfies the homotopy extension property (HEP).

An h-fibration is a map p : E −→ B that satisfies the covering homotopy property (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Consider the category A/ChR of chain complexes under a chain complex R. Let X and Y be R-chain complexes under A, with given maps i : A −→ X and j : A −→ Y . Two maps f, g : X −→ Y under A are said to be homotopic under A, or relative to A, if there is a homotopy h : X ⊗ I −→ Y between them such that h(a ⊗ [I]) = 0 for a ∈ A. That is, h restricts on A ⊗ I to the algebraic version of the constant homotopy at j. A cofiber homotopy equivalence is a homotopy equivalence under A. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Corollary 18.2.7. Let p : E −→ B be an h-acyclic h-fibration. Then ker(p) is contractible and p is isomorphic over B to the projection B ⊕ ker(p) −→ B. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Lemma 18.2.8. Let 0 /X f /Y g /Z /0 be an exact sequence of R-chain complexes whose underlying exact sequence of Rmodules splits degreewise.

Since the functor HomR (A, −) preserves finite direct sums of underlying graded R-modules (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

more sophisticated algebraic situations, there are h, r, and q-model structures, and they are all different. This happens, for example, if R is a commutative ring, A is a DG R-algebra, and we consider model structures on the category of differential graded A-modules 2 . In this situation, A need not be projective as an R-module, and then functors such as ⊗A and HomA rarely preserve exact sequences. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Of course, such splittings are given by maps of underlying graded R-modules which need not be maps of chain complexes. The following result (due to Cole [30]) shows that the splittings can be deformed to chain maps if the given R-split maps are homotopy equivalences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 18.3.4. Let 0 /X f /Y g /Z /0 be an exact sequence of R-chain complexes whose underlying exact sequence of graded R-modules splits. If f or g is a homotopy equivalence, then the sequence is isomorphic under X and over Z to the canonical exact sequence of R-chain complexes 0 /X /X ⊕ Z /Z / 0.

In topology, cellular approximation of maps allows us to replace cell complexes by equivalent CW complexes. In algebra, the comparison is much simpler and the difference is negligible since an “attaching n map” SR R −→ Fq X for a cell D n+1 R necessarily has image in the elements (Fq X)n of degree n. When we restrict attention to those X such that Xq = 0 for q < 0, as in classical projective resolutions, we may as well also restrict attention to those I-cell complexes such that Fq X = X≤q (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This gives X a second filtration that corresponds to the skeletal filtration of CW complexes in topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

An I-cell complex X has an increasing filtration given by its successive terms, which we shall here denote by Fq X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Of course, regarding an ungraded R-module M as a DG R-module concentrated in degree 0, a q-cofibrant approximation of M is exactly a projective resolution of M .

Remark 18.5.5. Hovey [66] has studied abelian categories with model structures in which the cofibrations are the monomorphisms with cofibrant cokernel and the fibrations are the epimorphisms with fibrant kernel.

The mixed model structure has all of the good formal properties of the q-model structure. It is proper, it is monoidal when R is commutative, and it is an ChZ -model structure in general. The identity functor on ChR is a right Quillen equivalence from the m-model structure to the q-model structure and therefore a left Quillen equivalence from the q-model structure to the m-model structure. The class Cm of m-cofibrations is very well-behaved (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Homotopy invariant constructions that start with complexes of projective R-modules automatically give m-cofibrant objects, but not necessarily degreewise projective objects. In particular, it is very often useful to study the perfect complexes, namely the objects of ChR that are homotopy equivalent to bounded complexes of finitely generated projective R-modules. These are the dualizable objects of HoChR (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

From the point of view of classical homological algebra, it is interesting to think of projective resolutions homotopically as analogues of approximation by CW complexes, well-defined only up to homotopy equivalence (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Of course, using either a q-cofibrant or m-cofibrant approximation P of an R-module M , regarded as a chain complex concentrated in degree 0, we have Tor R ∗ (N, M ) = H∗ (N ⊗R P ) and Ext∗ R (M, N ) = H ∗ HomR (P, N ), the latter regraded cohomologically. We can think of these as obtained by first applying the derived functors of N ⊗R (−) and HomR (−, N ) and then taking homology n groups or, equivalently, thinking in terms of spheres SR R , homotopy groups.

Indeed, this gives a new perspective on the construction of the homotopy category HoU of spaces from the naive homotopy category hU obtained by identifying homotopic maps and of the derived homotopy category HoChR of chain complexes from the naive homotopy category hChR .

Localization model structures codify Bousfield localization, which vastly generalizes the constructions in the first half of this book (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

There we concentrated on arithmetic localizations and completions that are closely related to standard algebraic constructions. We restricted our constructions to nilpotent spaces since that is the natural range of applicability of our elementary methodology and since most applications focus on such spaces. There are several different ways to generalize to non-nilpotent spaces, none of them well understood calculationally. Bousfield localization gives a general conceptual understanding of the most widely used of these, and it gives the proper perspective for generalizations to categories other than the category of spaces and (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In modern algebraic topology, especially in stable homotopy theory, Bousfield localizations at generalized homology theories play a fundamental role. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We are thinking of the weak homotopy equivalences in U and the quasi-isomorphisms in ChR (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

since we are thinking of actual homotopy equivalences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

As will become clear, the resolvant objects in U are the spaces of the homotopy types of CW complexes, and this codifies the Whitehead theorem for such spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Similarly, the (bounded below) resolvant objects in ChR are the chain complexes that are of the homotopy type of chain complexes of projective modules, and this codifies the analogous Whitehead theorem for such chain complexes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Writing “up to homotopy” to mean “in HoM ”, if f : D −→ X is any map from a resolvant object D to X, there is a map f ˜ f˜, unique up to homotopy, such that the following diagram commutes up to homotopy (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 19.2.2. For spaces X and a homology theory E∗ on spaces, say that ξ : X −→ Y is an E-equivalence if it induces an isomorphism E∗ (X) −→ E∗ (Y ) and let LE denote the class of E-equivalences. Say that a space Z is E-local if it is LE -local. Say that a map φ : X −→ XE from X into an E-local space XE is a localization at E if φ is an E-equivalence. Example 19.2.3. When E∗ (X) = H∗ (X; ZT ), these definitions agree up to nomenclature with our definition of localization at T in §5.2. Similarly, when E∗ (X) = H∗ (X; FT ), where FT = ×p∈T Fp , these definitions agree up to nomenclature with our definition of completion at T (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Observe that the names “localization” and “completion” that are carried over from algebra in the earlier parts of the book are really the names of two examples of a generalized notion of localization (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

the essential idea of Bousfield localization is to try to construct a model structure on M of the form (L , C , FL ). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

As an historical aside, Bousfield’s original treatment [15] first introduced the methods of transfinite induction into model category theory, and only later were his ideas codified into the notion of a cofibrantly generated model structure (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Little is known about the behavior on homotopy groups of localizations and completions of non-nilpotent spaces. Of course, for generalized homology theories E∗ , no such concrete descriptions can be expected, even for nilpotent spaces. The determination of the homotopy groups of particular E-localizations of spectra is a major part of stable homotopy theory. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

already for S 1 ∨ S n , the Bousfield-Kan completion at p does not induce an isomorphism on mod p homology.

More recently, Jeff Smith (unpublished) has proven that the f -localization model structure exists for any map f in any left proper combinatorial simplicial model category.

There is an extensive literature on f -localizations for a map f . The first existence proof is due to Bousfield [16], and the books [52, 63] study the foundations in detail. These sources work with simplicial sets. Dror Fajoun’s monograph [38] gives several variant existence proofs, and he explains how either simplicial sets or topological spaces can be used. His monograph analyzes many interesting examples in detail. Bousfield [18] gives a nice overview of this area, with many references. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remark 19.5.6. One can ask whether or not localizations at classes, rather than sets, of maps always exist. Remarkably, Casacuberta, Scevenels, and Smith [25] prove that this holds if Vopěnka’s principle (a certain large cardinal axiom) is valid, but that it cannot be proven using only the usual ZFC axioms of set theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We end our discussion of model categories and localization with a philosophical remark that contains a puzzling and interesting open problem. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In particular, in the categories of spaces or chain complexes, we have the qmodel structure and the m-model structure with the same weak equivalences and therefore with equivalent homotopy categories. In these cases, all objects are fibrant and so the definition of L -local objects is the same in the two cases. However, the question of the existence of the L -model structure is still model dependent. Clearly, asking whether or not (L , C , FL ) is a model structure is a different question for (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Remark 19.5.7. The notion of localizing a category M , or a homotopy category HoM , at a subcategory L of weak equivalences makes sense as a general matter of homotopical algebra, independent of model category theory. However, the general theory here depends on the chosen model structure since we have required L -local objects to be fibrant in a given model structure on M . Thus our definition of an L -local object really defines the notion of being L -local relative to a given model structure. For a fixed ambient category of weak equivalences W , there may be several model structures (W , C , F ) on M with different good properties (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The known existence proofs for L -local (or K -local) model structures on spaces start from the q-model structure. We actually do not know whether or not (L , Cm , Fℓ ) is a model structure even when we do know that (L , Cq , Fℓ ) is a model structure. We regard this as a quite unsatisfactory state of affairs, but we leave the existence of model structures (L , Cm , Fℓ ) as an open problem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

C = Cq and for C = Cm . Of course, FL depends on which choice we make, even though the fibrant objects are the same with both choices (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Thus the familiar concepts of algebra and module dualize to concepts of coalgebra and comodule, and the structures of algebra and coalgebra combine to give the notion of a bialgebra. Incorporating antipodes (sometimes called conjugations), we obtain the notion of a Hopf algebra. In the cocommutative case, bialgebras and Hopf algebras can be viewed as monoids and groups in the symmetric monoidal category of cocommutative coalgebras (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In categorical language, the category MR of graded R-modules is symmetric monoidal, and it is closed in the sense that there is a natural isomorphism Hom(A ⊗ B, C) ∼ = ∼ = Hom(A, Hom(B, C)); it sends f to g, where g(a)(b) = f (a ⊗ b) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

We say that A is projective if each Ai is projective (over R), and we say that A is of finite type if each Ai is finitely generated (over R). We say that A is bounded if it is non-zero in only finitely many degrees. Thus A is finitely generated if and only if it is bounded and of finite type. We say that A is bounded below (or above) if Ai = 0 for i sufficiently small (or large). Then ν is an isomorphism if A is bounded and either A or C is projective of finite type, ρ is an isomorphism if A is projective of finite type, and the last map α is an isomorphism if A and B are bounded below and A or B is projective of finite type (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A bialgebra (A, φ, ψ, η, ε) is an algebra (A, φ, η) with augmentation ε and a coalgebra (A, ψ, ε) with unit η such that the following diagram is commutative (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Ponto 329</a>)</p>
That is, φ is a morphism of coalgebras or, equivalently, ψ is a morphism of algebras. If the associativity of φ and coassociativity of ψ are deleted from the definition, then A is said to be a quasi bialgebra 1 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 329</a>)</p>
The flatness of A is usually not assumed but holds in practice; in its absence, the notion of bialgebra is perhaps too esoteric to be worthy of contemplation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Let A be an augmented algebra. Define the R-module QA of indecomposable elements of A by the exact sequence IA ⊗ IA φ / IA / QA / 0.

Let C be a unital coalgebra. Define the R-module P C of primitive elements of C by the exact sequence 0 / PC / JC ψ / JC ⊗ JC. Let IC = ker ε. We say that x ∈ IC is primitive if its image in JC lies in P C. Note that P C is well-defined even if C is not coassociative (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 20.2.8. Let A be a quasi bialgebra. Define ν : P A → QA to be the composite PA / JA ∼ = IA / QA (or, equivalently, the restriction of IA → QA to P A if P A is regarded as contained in A). A is said to be primitive, or primitively generated, if ν is an epimorphism; A is said to be coprimitive if ν is a monomorphism (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In the first case, that is a familiar fact from classical algebra since the intersection of the powers of a (two-sided) ideal in a ring can be non-zero [6, p. 110].

For a monoid G, the monoid ring R[G] is a bialgebra with product, coproduct, unit and counit induced by the product, diagonal, identity element, and trivial function G −→ {pt}. If G is a group, its inverse function induces an antipode on R[G], in the sense of the following definition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 20.3.1. An antipode χ on a bialgebra A is a map χ : A → A of R-modules such that the following diagrams commute. A ⊗O A id ⊗χ / A⊗A φ  A ⊗O A χ⊗id A⊗A φ  A ψ ε /R η /A A ψ O ε /R η /A A Hopf algebra is a bialgebra with a given antipode. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

. Historically, the concept of Hopf algebra originated in algebraic topology, where the term “Hopf algebra” was used for what we are calling a bialgebra (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P. May/More Concise Algebraic Topology_ Localization, Completion, and Model Categories (461)/More Concise Algebraic Topology Localization, Com.pdf#page=332" target="_blank">J. P. May & K.

the bialgebras that usually appear in algebraic topology automatically have antipodes (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Ponto 332</a>)</p>
We have followed the algebraic literature in using the name antipode and distinguishing between bialgebras and Hopf algebras because of the more recent interest in Hopf algebras of a kind that do not seem to appear in algebraic topology, such as quantum groups (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

It is a standard and easy observation that the tensor product is the categorical coproduct in the category of commutative algebras (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Recall that, in any category with products, we have the notion of a monoid, namely an object with an associative and unital product, and of a group, namely a monoid with an antipode.

Proposition 20.3.4. The tensor product is the categorical product in the category C of commutative coalgebras. A cocommutative bialgebra is a monoid in C , and a cocommutative Hopf algebra is a group in C . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Construction 20.3.5. Let C be a coalgebra and A be an algebra. Then Hom(C, A) is an algebra, called a convolution algebra. Its unit element is the composite C ε ε − →R η − → A and its product is the composite ∗ : Hom(C, A) ⊗ Hom(C, A) α α − → Hom(C ⊗ C, A ⊗ A) Hom(ψ,φ) −−−−−−→ Hom(C, A).

Ponto 332</a>)</p>
If C is unital with unit η and A is augmented with augmentation ε, then the set G(C, A) of maps of R-modules f : C −→ A such that f η = η and εf = ε is a submonoid of Hom(C, A) under the convolution product ∗.

Remark 20.3.6. Visibly, when A is a bialgebra, an antipode is a (two-sided) inverse to the identity map A −→ A in the monoid G(A, A) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

. With kernels and cokernels defined degreewise, the category of left A-modules is abelian. There is an analogous abelian category of right A-modules. For a right A-module (M, λ) and left A-module (N, ξ), the tensor product M ⊗A N , which of course is just an R-module, can be described as the cokernel of λ ⊗ id − id ⊗ξ : M ⊗ A ⊗ N → M ⊗ N ; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Definition 20.4.1. Let (A, φ, η) be an algebra. A left A-module (N, ξ) is an R-module N and action ξ : A ⊗ N → N such that the following diagrams commute.

Since ⊗ is right but not left exact, the category of left C-comodules does not admit kernels in general; it is abelian if C is a flat R-module (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 20.4.2. Given an augmentation ε : A → R of A, regard R as a (left and right) A-module via ε and define QA N = R ⊗A N = N/IA · N ; QA N is called the module of A-indecomposable elements of N and is abbreviated QN (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

For a general algebra A, the tensor product (over R) of A-modules is an A ⊗ A-module, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

An R-module A such that Ai = 0 for i < 0 (as we have tacitly assumed throughout) and A0 = R is said to be connected.

To illustrate the power of these beautiful but elementary algebraic results, we show how they can be used to prove Thom’s calculation of unoriented cobordism and Bott’s periodicity theorem for BU in §21.5 and §21.6.

We here prove various special properties that hold in the connected case but do not hold in general.

A Prüfer ring is an integral domain all of whose ideals are flat. A Noetherian Prüfer ring is a Dedekind ring. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The following result is a version of “Nakayama’s lemma”. It and its dual are used constantly in algebraic topology. Lemma 21.1.5. If A is a connected algebra and N is a left A-module, then N = 0 if and only if QN = 0. Proof. Clearly QN = 0 if and only if IA ⊗ N → N is an epimorphism, and this implies that N is zero by induction on degrees (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Since a direct summand of a flat module is flat, the assumption on π implies that QB is flat if B is flat.

The homology Hopf algebras H∗ (BU ; Z) and H∗ (BO; F2 ) enjoy a very special property: they are self-dual, so that they are isomorphic to the cohomology Hopf algebras H ∗ (BU ; Z) and H ∗ (BO; F2 ) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

A morphism of Lie algebras is a morphism of R-modules which commutes with the bracket operation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Definition 22.1.3. The universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra L is an associative algebra U (L) together with a morphism of Lie algebras i : L → U (L) such that, for any morphism of Lie algebras f : L → A, where A is an associative algebra, there exists a unique morphism of algebras f ˜ f˜ : U (L) → A such that f ˜ f˜i = f .

Clearly U (L) is unique up to canonical isomorphism, if it exists. Proposition 22.1.4.

The Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem gives a complete description of the associated graded Hopf algebra of U (L) with respect to a suitable filtration (under appropriate hypotheses) and therefore gives a complete description of the additive structure of U (L) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

Throughout this section and the next, R is assumed to be a field of characteristic zero.

If we write E(X) for the exterior algebra generated by an R-module X concentrated in odd degrees and P (X) for the polynomial algebra generated by an R-module X concentrated in even degrees, then, for a general R-module X, A(X) = E(X − ) ⊗ P (X + ), where X − and X + denote the submodules of X concentrated in odd and even degrees, respectively (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The following immediate consequence of the previous theorem was the theorem of Hopf which initiated the study of Hopf algebras. Corollary 22.4.2 (Hopf).

In this section, R is assumed to be a perfect field of characteristic p.

It is a well kept secret that the further one goes into the subject, the less one uses such complexes for actual calculation. Rather, one starts with a few spaces whose homology and cohomology groups can be computed by hand, using explicit chain complexes. One then bootstraps up such calculations to the vast array of currently known computations using a variety of spectral sequences (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

McCleary’s book [95] is a good encyclopedic reference for the various spectral sequences in current use.

We conclude that complete knowledge of the Bockstein spectral sequences of C for all primes p allows a complete description of H∗ (C) as a graded abelian group (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

The previous example shows that if X is a space whose homology is of finite type and if one can compute H∗ (X; Q) and H∗ (X; Fp ) together with the mod p Bockstein spectral sequences for all primes p, then one can read off H∗ (X; Z). For this reason, among others, algebraic topologists rarely concern themselves with integral homology but rather focus on homology with field coefficients (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

In practice, we often start with a homological filtered complex and dualize it to obtain a cohomological one, setting A ∗ = Hom(A, R) and filtering it by F p A ∗ = Hom(A/Fp−1 A, R) At least when R is a field, the resulting cohomology spectral sequence is dual to the homology spectral sequence.

Recall that a differential graded algebra (DGA) A over R is a graded algebra with a product that is a map of chain complexes, so that the Leibnitz formula d(xy) = d(x)y + (−1) degx xd(y) is satisfied. When suitably filtered, A often gives rise to a spectral sequence of DGA’s, meaning that each term E r is a DGA. It is no exaggeration to say that the calculational utility of spectral sequences largely stems from such multiplicative structure. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Leibnitz formula for each r ≥ 1. Example 24.4.3. The cup product in the singular cochains C ∗ (X) gives rise to the product φ : H ∗ (X; Fp ) ⊗ H ∗ (X; Fp ) → H ∗ (X; Fp ). Regarding H ∗ (X; Fp ) as the E1 term of the Bockstein spectral sequence of the cochain complex C ∗ (X), we find that φ satisfies µ. Therefore each E r in the mod p cohomology Bockstein spectral sequence of X is a DGA, and E r+1 = H ∗ (E r ) as an algebra (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

In applications, the important thing is to understand what the properties say. Their proofs generally play no role. In fact, this is true of most spectral sequences in algebraic topology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

It is usual to construct the Serre spectral using the singular (or, in Serre’s original work, cubical) chains of all spaces in sight. We give a more direct homotopical construction that has the advantage that it generalizes effortlessly to a construction of the Serre spectral sequence in generalized homology and cohomology theories.

Using [89, p. 48], we may as well replace p by a Hurewicz fibration. This is convenient since it allows us to exploit relationship between cofibrations and fibrations that does not hold for Serre fibrations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Using [89, p. 75], we may choose a based weak equivalence f from a CW complex with a single vertex to B (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Having a CW base space gives a geometric filtration with which to work, and having a single vertex fixes a canonical basepoint and thus a canonical fiber.

Theorem 24.5.1 (Homology Serre spectral sequence). There is a first quadrant homological spectral sequence {E r , dr }, with E 1 p,q ∼ = ∼ = Cp (B; Hq (F ; π)) and E 2 p,q ∼ = ∼ = Hp (B; Hq (F ; π)) that converges to H∗ (E; π). It is natural with respect to maps (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

and it is here that the local coefficient systems Hq (F ) enter into the picture. These groups depend on the action of π1 (B, b) on F . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

most of the usual applications, π1 (B, b) acts trivially on F and Hq (F ) is just the ordinary homology group Hq (F ), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

A short exact sequence 1 −→ G ′ −→ G −→ G ′′ −→ 1 of (discrete) groups gives a fibration sequence K(G ′ , 1) −→ K(G, 1) −→ K(G ′′ , 1), and there result Serre spectral sequences in homology and cohomology (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

This spectral sequence can also be constructed purely algebraically, and it is then sometimes called the Lyndon spectral sequence. It is an example where local coefficients are essential (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

Proposition 24.5.3 (Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence). Let G ′ be a normal subgroup of a group G with quotient group G ′′ and let π be a G-module. Then there is a spectral sequence with E ∼ = ∼ = H p (G ′′ ; H q (G ′ ; π)) that converges to H ∗ (G; A). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J. P.

The comparison theorem is particularly useful for the Serre spectral sequence when the base and fiber are connected and the fundamental group of the base acts trivially on the homology of the fiber (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/J.

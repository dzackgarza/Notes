## Highlights

- Theorem\. Integer-valued homology groups of a sphere with 9 handles, where 9 is a non-negative integer, have the form: Ho = Z, HI = Z2g ,H2 = Z\.

- Theorem\. Integer-valued homology groups of a projective plane have the form Ho = Z, HI = Z2, H2 = O\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Fomenko/Visual Geometry and Topology (720)/Visual Geometry and Topology - Fomenko.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">Fomenko 59</a>)
- Theorem\. Integer-valued homology groups of the Klein bottle have the form Ho = Z, HI = Z E9 Z2, H2 = O\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Fomenko/Visual Geometry and Topology (720)/Visual Geometry and Topology - Fomenko.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">Fomenko 59</a>)
- Theorem\. Integer-valued homology groups of a non-orientable twodimensional closed surface have the form: Ho = Z, HI = Zk-I Ell Z2, H2=0\.

- Next, we refer to the well-known algebraic theorem stating that any integer-valued matrix can, using the above-mentioned elementary transformations, be reduced to a canonical form\. This canonical form is as follows: on the principal diagonal of the matrix \(corning from the left top comer of the matrix\) there stand nonzero invariant factors whose number is equal to the matrix rank\. All the other matrix elements are equal to zero\.

- Recall that the diagonal elements \(invariant factors\) obtained are so ordered that each of them is a divisor of a subsequent one\. Invariant factors are uniquely determined by the matrix and can be calculated in (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Fomenko/Visual Geometry and Topology (720)/Visual Geometry and Topology - Fomenko.pdf#page=67" target="_blank">Fomenko 67</a>)
- terms of its minors\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Fomenko/Visual Geometry and Topology (720)/Visual Geometry and Topology - Fomenko.pdf#page=68" target="_blank">Fomenko 68</a>)
- Theorem\. Let Ilk be the number of k-dimensional simplexes of a simplicial complex X \(which corresponds to a certain triangulation of the polyhedron X\) and let Ik be the rank of the incidence matrix Ek\. Then the k-dimensional Betti number \(3k, i\.e\. the rank of the integer-valued homology group Hk\(X\), is equal to Ilk Ik Ik-I\. Given this, we assume that I-I = In = O\. Next, k-dimensional torsion coefficients of the group Hk\(X\) are those invariant factors of the incidence matrix Ek which are not equal to unity\. For k = n these torsion coefficients are absent, i\.e\. the group Hn\(X\), where n = dim X, is always free \(does not have finite-order elements\)\.

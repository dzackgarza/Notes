## Highlights

- The resulting theory [FQ] led quickly to a complete classifica tion of closed, simply connected topological 4-manifolds, and topological 4manifold theory now seems closely related to the theory of high-dimensional manifolds\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 8</a>)
- Using gauge theory \(differential geometry and nonlinear analysis\), Donaldson showed that smooth 4-manifolds are much different from their high-dimensional counterparts\. In fact, the predictions made by the s-cobordism and surgery conjectures for smooth 4-manifolds failed miserably, resulting in a dramatic clash between the theorics of smooth and topological manifolds in this dimension\. For example, this is the only dimension in which a fixed homeomorphism type of closed manifold is represented by infinitely many diffeomorphism types, or where there are manifolds homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to R®\. \(In fact, there are uncountably many such “exotic R\*’s”\.\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 8</a>)
- Donaldson’s program of analyzing the self-dual Yang-Mills equations [DK] was central to smooth 4-manifold theory for 12 years, until it was superseded in 1994 \(several revolutions later\) by analysis of the Seiberg-Witten equations (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 8</a>)
- That is, gauge theory proves the nonexistence of smooth manifolds satisfying various constraints, the nonexistence of connected-sum splittings, and the nonexistence of diffeomorphisms between pairs of manifolds\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 8</a>)
- perhaps the most powerful general technique for existence results \(particularly for manifolds with small Betti numbers\) is Kirby calculus\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 8</a>)
- This technique, which allows one to see the internal structure of a 4-manifold {or its boundary 3-manifold\) without loss of information, was created and developed into a fine art in the late 1970°s by topologists such as Akbulut, Fenn, Harer, Kaplan, Kirby, Melvin, Rourke, Rolfsen and Stern\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 8</a>)
- Much time was spent on ambitious goals that gauge theory now shows are impossible\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 8</a>)
- surprising connections have emerged with affine complex analysis and contact topology [G13], [G14] since a discovery of Eliashberg led to a theory of Kirby diagrams for representing Stein surfaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=9" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 9</a>)
- we have included Kirby diagrams representing all of the main types of closed, simply connected 4-manifolds \(as viewed from the current perspective of the theory\), namely complex surfaces of rational, elliptic and general type, a symplectic but noncomplex manifold and an irreducible nonsymplectic one\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=9" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 9</a>)
- There are many references for gauge theory as applied to 4-manifolds, notably [DK] \(one of the most recent references from the viewpoint of the self-dual equations\), and [KKM], [Mrl], [Sa] on Seiberg-Witten theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=9" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 9</a>)
- imilarly, the theory of complex surfaces is covered in detail in [BPV], and symplectic topology is carefully treated in (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=9" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 9</a>)
- Similarly, the theory of complex surfaces is covered in detail in [BPV], and symplect (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=9" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 9</a>)

- For topological 4-manifolds, the reader is referred to [FQ] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 10</a>)
- Although we treat Rolfsen calculus in some detail, the reader is also referred to [Ro] for this 3-dimensional technique related to Kirby calculus\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 10</a>)
- We will use the terms principal G-bundle, tangent bundle of a manifold, associated vector bundle and section of a bundle without defining them\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 15</a>)
- {Detailed treatments of these topics can be found in, e\.g\., [GP], [MS] and [Sp]\.\) D (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 15</a>)
- A pair \(Uy, ¢a\) of such a neighborhood and homeomorphism is called a chart\. A collection of charts {\(Uy, do\) | @ € A} is an atlas if it is a cover of X, that is, |J{Ua | @ € A} = X\. The map ¢go¢,! \(on ¢o\(UaNUp\)\) is the transition function between the charts \(Ua, $a\) and \(Us, $3\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 15</a>)
- orresponding to points in {\(z1,\.\.\.,2n\) | Zn = 0} = R\*1 CR" form a submanifold 0X of dimension n — 1, which is called the boundary of X\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 16</a>)
- The topological manifold X with an atlas {\(Ua, ¢\.\) | @ € A} is a CT-manifold \(r =1,2,3,\.\.\.,00\) if the transition functions ¢5 0 471 \(a, 8 € A\) are O"maps\. In the case r = oo, X is called a smooth manifold\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 16</a>)
- Two C"structures on X are isotopic if the identity map idy is isotopic \(homotopic through homeomorphisms\) to a C-diffecomorphism between the structures\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 16</a>)
- We say that X is closed if it is compact and 0X = §\. We call a space X a singular manifold if there is a finite subset Sing C X such that X — Sing is a smooth manifold\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 16</a>)
- An orientation of the Euclidean vector space B® is simply a choice of one orbit of the set of ordered bases under the action of the connected group GLT\(n;R\) = {A € GL\(n;R\) | det\(A\) > 0}\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 16</a>)
- An orientation can be given by fixing an ordering \(up to even permutations\) of a given basis\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 16</a>)
- A consistent choice of orientation of the tangent space at every point of X is called an orientation of X\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 16</a>)
- The standard convention of “outward normal first” provides an orientation of 8X induced by an orientation of X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 16</a>)
- At p € 0X the basis {v1,\.\.\. ,un—1\) of T,0X is positive if \(v,v1,\.\.\. ,vp—1\) is a positive basis of T,X, where the vector » stands for the outward normal vector, which is tangent to X but not to 3X and pomts out of X\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 16</a>)
- It can be shown that an orientation specifies a class [X] in H,\.\(X,0X;Z\)}, called the fundamental class (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 17</a>)
- In this way, orientability can easily be extended to topological manifolds as well: An n-dimensional connected manifold X is orientable if Hn\(X,8X;2Z\) = Z, and an orientation of X is simply a choice of a generator of the group H,\(X,8X;Z\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 17</a>)
- The induced orientation of 8X can be seen as the image of [X]| € H,\(X,8X;Z\) under the map Hn\(X,0X;Z\) — Hy,1\(0X;Z\) of the long exact sequence of the pair \(X,8X\); (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 17</a>)
- The smooth ndimensional manifold X is orientable if the structure group of the tangent bundle TX — X \(which is GL{n;R\)}\) can be reduced to its connected component GL'\(n;R\); by fixing a reduction we specify an orientation for X\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 17</a>)
- An atlas {{Uy, d\.\) | @ € Ag} on a \(real\) 2n-dimensional manifold X is a complex structure if each ¢, is a homeomorphism between U, and an open subset of C\* \(identified with B2"\), and the transition functions ¢go¢,! are holomorphic\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 17</a>)
- Complex manifolds are canonically oriented\. This is because the connected group GL\(n;C\) lies in GL \(2n;R\), so any complex n-dimensional vector space is canonically oriented -— by choosing a complex isomorphism with C" = C x \.\.\. x C, with C oriented as a real vector space by the ordered basis \(1,3\)\.

- A smooth \(resp\. topological\) isotopy between embceddings ¢g, 1: Y — X is a smooth \(resp\. topological\) homotopy ¢;: Y — X \(0 <t <1\) through embeddings\.

- if is compact then any smooth isotopy ¥ — int X can be extended to an ambienl isotopy, an isotopy ®;: X — X through diffeomorphisms such that bg = idx and pp; = B; 0g for each t\.

- Theorem 1\.1\.6 demonstrates the fact that although the notion of C’-manifold is defined for every integer r \(0 < r < oo\), the r = 0 and r = 00 cases are the only interesting ones in terms of classification\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 17</a>)
- Theorem 1\.1\.6\. \([Mu]\) Suppose that X is a CT-manifold and 1 < r < k \(including k = oo\)\. Then there is a C\*-atlas of X for which the induced (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 17</a>)
- CT -structure is isotopic to the original C"-siructure of X\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 18</a>)
- consequently the C"-manifold X admits a unique induced C\*-structure for every k > r (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 18</a>)
- Our primary aim in manifold theory is to classify topological manifolds, i\.e\., to give a complete list of n-dimensional \(closed\) topological manifolds, and to find a way to tell which topological manifolds carry smooth structures \(have C-atlases\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 18</a>)
- Furthermore, if there is one such atlas, we would like to determine the total number of these up to diffeomorphism\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 18</a>)
- In most dimensions this aim cannot be achieved for algebraic reasons \(cf\. Theorem 1\.2\.33 and Exercise 5\.1\.10\(c}\); in those cases we will impose further conditions \(like \. simple connectivity\) for the manifolds at hand\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 18</a>)
- The classification problem is easy in dimension 1 and classical in dimension 2\. Up to homeomorphism there is only one topological 1-manifold with the above properties, and this is the circle §! = {z € R? | ||z|| = 1}; it admits a unique isotopy class of smooth structures\. For n = 2, the \(oriented\) topological 2manifolds are precisely the surfaces Xi with genus g¢ \(9 = 0,1,2,\.\.\.\); in particular, £g is the sphere 5? and ¥; is the 2-dimensional torus T° = §1 x $1\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 18</a>)
- Assume that the manifolds we are working with are closed, connected and oriented\. T (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 18</a>)
- All these topological manifolds carry unique smooth structures \(up to isotopy\); actually these manifolds carry complex structures as well\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 18</a>)
- It is known that every topological 3-manifold admits a unique smooth structure [Mo]; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 18</a>)
- ; the classification problem of topological 3-manifolds is, however, still unsolved\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 18</a>)
- Understanding 3-manifolds homotopy equivalent to the 3-dimensional sphere S% would be a major step in this direction; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 18</a>)
- Conjecture 1\.1\.7\. \(Poincaré Conjecture\) A simply connected closed 3manifold is homeomorphic to 5°\.

- For topological manifolds of dimension n > 5 there is sophisticated machinery for dealing with both the existence problem and the number of nonisotopic smooth structures on a given topological manifold\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 18</a>)
- Theorem 1\.1\.8\. If X™ is a compact n-dimensional topological manifold andn > 6 \(orn > 5 and 8X = B\), then there are only finitely many smooth structures on X \(up to isotopy\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 19</a>)
- In particular, there are smooth manifolds Yi,\.\.\.,Y: homeomorphic to X such that any smooth manifold homeomorphic to X is diffeomorphic to some Y;\. \(Here k might be 0, meaning that there is no smooth structure on X\.\)} (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 19</a>)
- Theorem 1\.1\.9\. If X is homeomorphic to R® and n # 4 then X is diffeomorphic to R"\. If n = 4, this statement is false, there are “exotic” R's; such examples will be given in Sections 9\.3 and 9\.4\. 0 In general, the term exotic smooth structure is used to refer to smooth structures not diffeomorphic to the given one on a smooth manifold X\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 19</a>)
- Remark 1\.1\.10\. Another sort of structure frequently used by topologists is a piecewise linear \(PL-\) structure, which is defined by an atlas whose transition functions respect a suitable triangulation of R™ \(e\.g\., [RS]\)\. Any smooth structure determines a PL-structure, and the converse holds for n < 6 [HM], so for our purposes PL-structures are equivalent to smooth structures\.

- Definition 1\.2\.1\. The symmetric bilinear form Qx: HY\(X,0X;Z\) x H4\(X,0X;Z\) — Z defined by Qx \(a,b\) = {\(aUb, [X]}\) = a-b eZ is called the intersection form of X\. Since by Poincaré duality Ho\(X;Z\) = H%\(X,0X;Z\), Qx is defined on Ho{X;Z\) x Hy\(X; Z\) as well\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 19</a>)
- Clearly, Qx{a,b}\) = 0 if a or b is a torsion element, hence Qx descends to a pairing on homology mod torsion\. By choosing a basis of Hy\(X; Z\)/Torsion, we can represent Qx by a matrix\. The matrix M of Qx transforms under a basis transformation C as CTMC\. Consequently the determinant det M is independent of the choice of the basis over Z: we sometimes denote this by det x\.

- \(a\) The above definition of @x can be extended to cohomology with arbitrary coefficient ring B\. When R = Z,, the theory generalizes in the obvious way to nonorientable manifolds\.

- A class a € Ho\(X™;Z\) is represented by a closed, oriented surface T if there is an embedding i: ¥ «— X such that i\.\([X]\) = a\. \(Again, [X] € Hyo\(Z; Z\) is the fundamental class of XI\)\.

- In arbitrary dimensions, the same method of counting intersections gives the intersection pairing \(including relative versions\) for any two homology classes of complementary dimension, and this is again dual to the cup product pairing [GH]\.

- 1\.4\.1\. Characteristic classes\. The set of isomorphism classes of U\(1\)bundles \(O\(1\)-bundles resp\.\) over X will be denoted by Lx \(Rx resp\.\)\. Obviously Lx and Rx admit group structurcs with the tensor product of linc bundles as multiplication\.

- Proposition 1\.4\.1\. The groups Lx and H\*\(X;Z\) are canonically isomorphic; similarly, Rx and H\(X;Z;\) are canonically isomorphic groups\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=36" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 36</a>)
- From algebraic topology we know that H2\(X;Z\) = |X, K\(Z,2\)], (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 37</a>)
- Bundle theory tells us that Lx and [X, BU\(1\)] are isomorphic \(where BU\(1} is the classifying space for U{1\)-bundles\)\. An easy argument shows that both K\(Z,2\) and BU\(1} are homotopy equivalent to CP, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 37</a>)
- The proof that Rx = H!\(X;Z3\) rests on the fact that both K{Zz,1\) and BO\(1\) are homotopy equivalent to RP\.

- The isomorphism Cx — H2?\(X;Z\) \(with suitably chosen sign\) is usually called ¢;3, and ¢1\(L\) is the first Chern class of the complex line bundle L\. Similarly, wi: Rx — H\(X; Zs\) is the isomorphism given by Proposition 1\.4\.1, and wy \(R\) is the first StiefelWhitney class of the real line bundle R — X\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 37</a>)
- An alternative obstruction theoretic — description of ¢; \(and of un\) can be given in the following way\. {Compare with Section 5\.6\.\) Suppose that X has a CW-decomposition and IL — X is a U\(1\)-bundle; note that for each cell f: D\* — X, the bundle f\*L over D\* is canonically trivial\. Obviously L is trivial on the O-skeleton of X, and since U{\(1\) is connected, such a trivialization can be extended over the 1-skeleton\. Comparing this trivialization with the canonical trivialization over each 2-cell defines a map @: 0D? — U\(1\) = S? for every 2-cell D? hence associates a number \(the degree of v\) to every 2-cell\. In this way we define a cochain c\. Claim 1\.4\.2\. The cochain c is a cocycle, and the class [¢] € H%\*\(X;Z\) depends only on the bundle L — X \(and is independent of the CW-decomposition and the trivialization\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 37</a>)
- Note that if [c] = 0, so the trivialization can be changed over the 1-skeleton in such a way that it extends over the 2-gkeleton, then I is trivial\. This follows from the fact that when we want to extend the trivialization to higher dimensional cells, we do not find any more obstructions, since all maps 8D% — U\(1\) = §! are nullhomotopic once k > 2\. Theorem 1\.4\.3\. The above-defined class {¢] € H\*\(X:Z\) of L — X coincides with the Chern class ¢1\(L\) defined by the isomorphism of Proposition 1\.4\.1\.

- Since each line bundle can be regarded as the pull-back of the tautological line bundle + — CP\*°, Theorem 1\.4\.3 has to be proved only for 7\.

- The component of ¢\(E\) in H\*#\(X;Z\) is called the i¥\* Chern class ¢;\(E\) of E,so \(BE\) =1+c1\(E\) +\.\.\. + cu\(E\)\. Hence ¢;\(E\) is the value of the i elementary symmetric polynomial of n variables evaluated on ¢;1{L1\),\.\.\. ,c1{Lyn\)\.

For a real n-plane bundle F — X the Pontrjagin classes p;\(F} € H¥\(X;Z\) can be defined by the formula p;\(F\) = \(—1\)c\(F ®g C\)\.

- The importance of these constructions in dimension four becomes clear once we generalize the notion of spin structures to spin® structures and list the spectacular results based on that theory (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=46" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 46</a>)
- The group Spin\(n\) can be constructed as a subgroup of a 2"-dimensional real algebra, the Clifford algebra Cl,\.

- Using the above complex representation Sp, of Spin\(n\), one can associate the vector bundle § — X to Pgpin\(n\) — X\. Sections of § — X are the spinors over X\.

- There is a canonical object associated to the metric g on X, which is the Levi-Civita connection Vg: T\(X; TX\) » IX; TX @T\*X\)\. \(As usual, I'\(X; F\) denotes the vector space of C®-sections of the vector bundle F' — X\.} This connection can be pulled back to the Spin\(n\)-bundle Pg, — X, defining a covariant differentiation V: I'\(X;S\) — I'\(X;S ® 7" X\) on the associated bundle S§ — X (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=47" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 47</a>)
- Remark 1\.4\.31\. It is a standard fact of differential geometry \(cf\.

- Applying the above definition fiberwise, we get an alternative definition of spin structures over a 4-manifold: A spin structure for the 4-dimensional \(oriented\) Riemannian manifold X\* is a pair of SU\(2\)-bundles $\* — X and an isomorphism : TX — Homyg\(S\*, 5™\) compatible with the metrics\.

- We cut out the pair \(D, F\) and replace it with \(D, R\), where R C D is obtained by perturbing R={\(zn,2\)€C®lan=¢ af +|2f <1} 0<lg <1\) to achieve that 8F = OR C 8D\.

- By replacing \(D, F} with \(D, R\) we eliminate the singular point P, but we do not change either the ambient manifold CP? \(since we cut out D and then glue it back\) or the homology class of 3; UX, \(since the subsets F and R are homologous in \(D,0D}\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=50" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 50</a>)

Note that 8F C 8D = 8° is the Hopf link \(see Figure 2\.1 and Section 4\.6\) and R is a Seifert surface on the Hopf link (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus (709)/4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus - Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz.pdf#page=50" target="_blank">Robert Gompf, Andas Stipsicz 50</a>)

- The polynomial defining the d distinct lines in the above exercise is a product of d linear polynomials, and so does not satisfy the hypothesis of the Implicit Function Theorem everywhere\.

- in this way one changes the surface defined by the polynomial everywhere, but obtains a complex submanifold\. The desingularization process described above changes 2; U 22 only in a small neighborhood of P \(so it is a local process\), but we lose the property that the resulting manifold is a complex submanifold\.

- This is because for complex surfaces the evenness of b1\(S\) is equivalent to the Kahler condition \(cf\. Theorem 10\.1\.4\), and this latter implies that the manifold is symplectic\.

Thus, among the smooth surfaces representing dh, the complex submanifolds have minimal genus\.

Cayley's Theorem and Sylow's Theorem as well as many of the results and applications in Sections 6. 1 and 6.2 are based on groups acting on sets (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=853" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

Galois Theory developed one of the most beautiful correspondences in of the results and applications in Sections 6. 1 and 6.2 are based on groups acting on sets. The chapter on Galois Theory developed one of the most beautiful correspondences in mathematics where the action of a group as automorphisms of a field gives rise to a correspondence between the lattice of subgroups of the Galois group and the lattice of subfields of a Galois extension of fields.

In Part III we saw that modules are the "representation objects" for rings in the sense that the axioms for an R-module specify a "ring action" of R on some abelian group M · which preserves the abelian group structure of M (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=853" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

In the case where M was an F[x]-module, x acted as a linear transformation from the vector space M to itself. In Chapter 1 2 the classification of finitely generated modules over Principal Ideal Domains gave us a great deal of information about these linear transformations of M (e.g., canonical forms). In Chapter 16 we used the ideal structure in Dedekind Domains to generalize the results of Chapter 1 2 to the classification of finitely generated modules over such domains. In this part we follow a process similar to the study of F[x ]-modules, replacing the polynomial ring with the group ring F G of G and classifying all finitely generated FG-modules for certain fields F (Wedderburn's Theorem). We then use this classification to derive some results about finite groups such as Burnside's Theorem on the solvability of groups of order p a qb (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=853" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

Recall that if V is a vector space over F, then G L ( V) is the group of nonsingular linear transformations from V to itself group. We first introduce the basic terminology. Recall that if V is a vector space over F, then G L ( V) is the group of nonsingular linear transformations from V to itself (under composition), and if n e z+ , then GLn (F) is the group of invertible n x n matrices with entries from F (under matrix multiplication). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=854" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

Definition. Let G be a finite group, let F be a field and let V be a vector space over F. (1) A linear representation of G is any homomorphism from G into GL (V) . The degree of the representation is the dimension of V. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=854" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M. Foote 854</a>)</p>
(3) A linear or matrix representation is faithful if it is injective. (4) The group ring of G over F is the set of all formal sums of the form with componentwise addition and multiplication (ag) ({3h) = (a{3)(g h) (where a and {3 are multiplied in F and gh is the product in G) extended to sums via the distributive law (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=854" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

Recall that if V is a finite dimensional vector space of dimension n, then by fixing a basis of V we obtain an isomorphism G L ( V) � GLn (F). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=854" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

). Furthermore, basis when we wish to give an explicit correspondence between the two). Furthermore, given a linear representation cp : G � G L(V) of finite degree, a corresponding matrix representation provides numerical invariants (such as the determinant of cp (g) for g E G) which are independent of the choice of basis (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=855" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

FG is a commutative ring if and only if G is an abelian group. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=855" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M. Foote 855</a>)</p>
F G is a vector space over F with the elements of G as a basis. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=855" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M. Foote 855</a>)</p>
F is in the center of FG (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=855" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M. Foote 855</a>)</p>
particular, FG is a vector space over F of dimension equal to I G I . The elements of F commute with all elements of FG, i.e., F is in the center of FG. When we wish to emphasize the latter two properties we shall say that F G is an F -algebra (in general, an F -algebra is a ring R which contains F in its center, so R is both a ring and an F -vector space). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=855" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M. Foote 855</a>)</p>
Note that the operations in FG are similar to those in the F -algebra F[x] (although F[x] is infinite dimensional over F). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=855" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

mples 1) If G = ( g ) is cyclic of order n E z+ , then the elements of F G are of the form n1 L a;gi . i =O L a;gi . i =O The map F [x] -+ F ( g ) which sends xk to g k for all k 0 extends by F -linearity to a smjective ring homomorphism with kernel equal to the ideal generated by x n 1 . Thus F( g ) � F[x]f(x n I ) . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=856" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

This i s an isomorphism of F-algebras, i.e., i s a ring isomorphism which i s F -linear. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=856" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M. Foote 856</a>)</p>
Thus the ring F ( g ) contains zero divisors (provided n > 1 ) . More generally, if G is any group of order > 1 , then for any nonidentity element g E G, F ( g ) is a subring of F G, so F G also contains zero divisors. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=856" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

we discuss the correspondence between representations of G and F G-modules (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=856" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M. Foote 856</a>)</p>
Make V into an FG-module by defining the action of a ring element on an element of V as follows (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=856" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M. Foote 856</a>)</p>
Note that F is a subring of F G and the action of the field element a on a vector is the same as the action of the ring element a l on a vector i.e., the FG-module action extends the F action on V . (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=857" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

Giving a representation fP l { fP G -+ G L(V) a representation G -+ G L ( V) on a vector space V over F is therefore equivalent to giving an FG-module V (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=857" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

This discussion shows there is a bijection between F G-modules and pairs (V, qJ): (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=857" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M. Foote 857</a>)</p>
that if a vector space M is made into an F [x]-module via the linear transformation T, then the F [x]-submodules of M are precisely the T­ stable subspaces of M (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=857" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

In the current situation if V is an FG-module affording the representation fP, then a subspace U of V is called G-invariant or G-stable if g · u E U for all g E G and all u E U (i.e., if qJ(g)(u) E U for all g E G and all u E U). It follows easily that the FG-submodules of V are precisely the G-stable subspaces of V .

ism of G into GL t (F) which sends every group element to the I x 1 We shall henceforth refer to this as the trivial representation of G . the homomorphism of G into GL t (F) which sends every group elemen identity matrix. We shall henceforth refer to this as the trivial represe The trivial representation has degree 1 and i f I G I > 1 , i t is not faithful.

Foote 858</a>)</p>
This (linear or matrix) representation is called the regular representation of G. Note that each nonidentity representation is called the regular representation of G. Note that each nonidentity element of G induces a nonidentity permutation on the basis of V so the regular representation is always faithful. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=858" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

The trivial representation has degree 1 and i f I G I > 1 , i t is not faithful. Let V = FG and consider this ring as a left module over itself. Then V affords a representation of G of degree equal to I G I .

This provides an (injec­ tive) homomorphism of Sn into G L ( V) (i.e., a faithful representation of Sn of degree n), hence makes V into an FSn -module (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=858" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

many situations it is easier to specify an explicit matrix representation of a group G rather than to exhibit an FG-module (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=859" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

A 4-dimensional representation of the quatemion group Qs may be obtained from This representation of Qs is faithfuL A 4-dimensional representation of the quatemion group Qs may be obtained from the real Hamilton quatemions, (cf. Section 7. 1). The group Q s is a subgroup of A 4-dimensional representation of the quatemion group Qs may be obtained from the real Hamilton quatemions, (cf. Section 7. 1). The group Q s is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of units of Ill[ and each of the elements of Q s acts by left the real Hamilton quatemions, (cf. Section 7. 1). The group Q s is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of units of Ill[ and each of the elements of Q s acts by left multiplication on the 4-dimensional real vector space Ill[ Since the real numbers are in the multiplicative group of units of Ill[ and each of the elements of Q s acts by left multiplication on the 4-dimensional real vector space Ill[ Since the real numbers are in the center ofJH[ (i.e., since Ill[is an IR-algebra), left multiplication is IR-Iinear. This linear multiplication on the 4-dimensional real vector space Ill[ Since the real numbers are in the center ofJH[ (i.e., since Ill[is an IR-algebra), left multiplication is IR-Iinear.

Recall that i n the study of a linear transformation T of a vector space V to itself we made V into an F[x ]-module (where x acted as T on V); our goal was to decompose V into a direct sum of cyclic submodules. In this way we were able to find a basis of V for which the matrix of T with respect to this basis was in some canonical form (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=860" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

Definition. Two representations of G are equivalent (or similar) if the FG-modules affording them are isomorphic modules (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=860" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

Definition. Let R be a ring and let M be a nonzero R-module. (1) The module M is said to be irreducible (or simple) if its only submodules are 0 and M; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=861" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

and M; otherwise M is called reducible. The module M is said to be indecomposable if M cannot be written as M1 El1 M2 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=861" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

The module M is said to be completely reducible if it is a direct sum of irreducible submodules.

A representation is called irreducible, reducible, indecomposable, decompos­ able or completely reducible according to whether the F G-module affording it has the corresponding property.

An irreducible module is, by definition, both indecomposable and completely re­ ducible. We shall shortly give examples of indecomposable modules that are not irre­ ducible (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=861" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

If R = F G, an irreducible F G-module V is a nonzero F -vector space with no non­ If R = F G, an irreducible F G-module V is a nonzero F -vector space with no non­ trivial, proper G-invariant subspaces. For example, if dimF V = 1 then V is necessarily irreducible (its only subspaces are 0 and V).

So reducible representations are those with a corresponding matrix representation whose matrices are in block upper triangular fonn.

Thus decomposable representations are those with a corresponding matrix representation whose matrices are in block diagonal fonn (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=862" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

If I G I > 1 , the regular representation of G is reducible (the augmentation ideal and the trace ideal are proper nonzero submodules). We shall later determine the conditions under which this representation is completely reducible and how it decomposes into a direct sum.

noted in Example 1 in the set of examples of group algebras, F( g } � F[x]j(xn 1). Thus the FG-modules are precisely the F[x]-modules annihilated by xn 1 . The latter (finite dimensional) modules are described, up to equivalence, by the Jordan Canonical Form Theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=862" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

If the minimal polynomial of g acting on an F ( g } -module V has distinct roots in F , there is a basis of V such that g (hence all its powers) is represented by a diagonal (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=862" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

In this case, V is a completely reducible F( g }­ module (being a direct sum of ! -dimensional ( g }-invariant subspaces). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=863" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

The polynomial x ble F( g }­ n general, tinct roots n 1 has distinct roots in F if and only if the characteristic of F does not divide n.

Foote 863</a>)</p>
Now V is reducible (span{v} is a ( g }-invariant subspace) but V is indecomposable (the above 2 x 2 elementary Jordan matrix is not similar to a diagonal matrix).

The first fundamental result in the representation theory of finite groups shows how Example 5 generalizes to noncyc lic groups. Theorem 1. (Maschke 's Theorem) Let G be a finite group and let F be a field whose characteristic does not divide J G J . If V is any FG-module and U i s any submodule of characteristic does not divide J G J . If V is any FG-module and U i s any submodule of V , then V has a submodule W s uc h that V = U ffi W ( i .e. , every submodule is a direct summand) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=863" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M. Foote 863</a>)</p>
The applications of Maschke's Theorem will be to finitely generated FG-modules. Unlike the situation of F[x]-modules, however, finitely generated FG-modules are automatically finite dimensional vector spaces (the difference being that FG itself is finite dimensional, whereas F [x] is not) .

Corollary 2. If G is a finite group and F is a field whose characteristic does not divide I G I , then every finitely generated FG-module is completely reducible (equivalently, every F -representation of G of finite degree is completely reducible).

The converse of Maschke's Theorem is also true. Namely, if the characteristic of F does divide I G I , then G possesses (finitely generated) F G-modules which are not completely reducible. Specifically, the regular representation (i.e., the module F G itself) is not completely reducible (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=866" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

In this section we give a famous classification theorem due to Wedderburn which de­ scribes, in particular, the structure of the group algebra F G when the characteristic of F does not divide the order of G. From this classification theorem we shall derive various consequences, including the fact that for each finite group G there are only a finite number of nonisomorphic irreducible F G-modules. This result, together with Maschke's Theorem, in some sense completes the Holder Program for representation theory of finite groups over such fields.

The remainder of the book is concerned with Maschke's Theorem, in some sense completes the Holder Program for representation theory of finite groups over such fields. The remainder of the book is concerned with developing t hnique s for determining and working with the irreducible representations as well as applying this knowledge to obtain group-theoretic information (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=868" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

Theorem 4. (Wedderburn's Theorem) Let R be a nonzero ring with l (not necessarily commutative). Then the following are equivalent: (1) every R-module is projective (2) every R-module is injective (3) every R-module is completely reducible (4) the ring R considered as a left R-module is a direct sum: 8 54 left R-module is a direct s R = L 1 EB L2 EB · · · EB Ln .

(5) as rings, R is isomorphic to a direct product of matrix rings over division rings, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=869" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M. Foote 869</a>)</p>
Definition. A ring R satisfying any of the (equivalent) properties i n Theorem 4 is called semisimple with minimwn condition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=869" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

Rings R satisfying any of the equivalent conditions of Theorem 4 also satisfy the minimum condition or descending chain condition (D. C. C) on left ideals: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=869" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

example, group algebras always have this property since in any strictly descending chain of ideals the vector space dimensions of the ideals (which are F -subspaces of FG) are strictly decreasing, hence the length of a the ideals (which are F -subspaces of FG) are strictly decreasing, hence the length of a strictly descending chain is at most the dimension of F G ( = I G 1). We shall therefore use the term "semisimple" to mean "semisimple with minimum condition." The rings R; in conclusion (5) of Wedderburn' s Theorem are called the Wedderburn components of R and the direct product decomposition of R is called its Wedderburn decomposition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=869" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

A commutative semisimple ring with minimum condition is an Artinian ring with Jacobson radical equal to zero and so is a direct product of fields (which are its Wedderburn components). One should note that condition (5) is a two-sided (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=869" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

In particular it implies that a sernisimple ring also has the minimum condition on right ideals: A useful way of thinking of the elements of the direct product R 1 x · · · x Rr in conclusion (5) is as n x n (block diagonal) matrices (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=869" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

Let G = S3 . By Theorem 10 the number of irreducible complex representations of explores the irreducible representations of cyclic groups over Q. Let G = S3 . By Theorem 10 the number of irreducible complex representations of G is three (= the number of conjugacy classes of S3 ). Since the sum of the squares of the degrees is 6, the degrees must be I , 1 and 2. The two degree 1 representations are immediately evident: the trivial representation and the representation of S3 into are immediately evident: the trivial representation and the representation of S3 into { ± 1 } given by mapping a permutation to its sign (i.e., u 1-+ + 1 if u is an even permu­ { ± 1 } given by mapping a permutation to its sign (i.e., u 1-+ + 1 if u is an even permu­ tation and u �-+ 1 if u is an odd permutation). The degree 2 representation can be found by decomposing the permutation representation on 3 basis vectors (described tation and u �-+ 1 if u is an odd permutation). The degree 2 representation can be found by decomposing the permutation representation on 3 basis vectors (described in Section 1) into irreducibles as follows: let S3 act on the basis vectors et , eJ of a vector space V by permuting their indices. The vector t = e 1 + e2 + e3 is a nonzero fixed vector, so t spans a !-dimensional G-invariant subspace (which is a copy of the trivial representation). By Maschke's Theorem there is a 2-dimensional G-invariant complement, I . Note that the permutation representation is not a sum of degree 1 representations: otherwise it could be represented by diagonal matrices and the per­ mutations would commute in their action this is impossible since the representation is faithful and G is non-abelian. Thus I cannot be decomposed further, so I affords the irreducible 2-dimensional representation (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/David Steven Dummit/Abstract Algebra (656)/Abstract Algebra - David Steven Dummit.pdf#page=876" target="_blank">David Steven Dummit & Richard M.

If ({! is a representation of G afforded by the F G-module V , the character of ({! If ({! is a representation of G afforded by the F G-module V , the is the function x G -+ F defined by x (g ) = tr q; (g). where tr q;(g) is the trace of the matrix of q; (g ) with respect to some basis of V (i.e., the sum of the diagonal entries of that matrix). The character is called irreducible or reducible according to whether the representation is irreducible or reducible, respectively. The degree of a character is the degree of any repre­ sentation affording it.

## Notes
Interesting change of variables trick for integration. Example: 1/(1+x^2). (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Walter Rudin/Real and Complex Analysis (439)/Real and Complex Analysis - Walter Rudin.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">Walter Rudin 19</a>)</p>

## Highlights
The Riesz representation theorem and the Hahn-Banach theorem allow one to " guess " the Poisson integral formula. They team up in the proof of Runge's theorem. They combine with Blaschke's theorem on the zeros of bounded holomorphic functions to give a pro (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Walter Rudin/Real and Complex Analysis (439)/Real and Complex Analysis - Walter Rudin.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Walter Rudin 14</a>)</p>
of of the Miintz-Szasz theorem, which concerns approximation on an interval. The fact that 13 is a Hilbert space is used in the proof of the Radon-Nikodym theorem, which leads to the theorem about differentiation of indefinite integrals, which in turn yields the existence of radial limits of bounded harmonic functions. The theorems of Plancherel and Cauchy combined give a theorem of Paley and Wiener which, in turn, is used in the Denjoy-Carleman theorem about infinitely differentiable functions on the real line. The maximum modulus theorem gives information about linear transformÂ­ line. The maximum ations on I!-spaces.

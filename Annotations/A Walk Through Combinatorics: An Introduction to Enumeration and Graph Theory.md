## Notes

- The key is that when you partition this way, the intersection of the two subsets is no empty\. This fails for n=2\.

## Highlights

- Theorem 1\.1\. [Pigeon-hole Principle] Let n and k be positive integers, and let n > k\. Suppose we have to place n identical balls into k identical boxes, where n > k\. Then there will be at least one box in which we place at least two balls\. Proof\.

- Theorem 1\.4\. [Pigeon-hole Principle, general version] Let n,m and r be positive integers so that n > rm\. Let us distribute n identical balls into m identical boxes\. Then there will be at least one box into which we place at least r + 1 balls (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=23" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 23</a>)
- Example 1\.3\. A chess tournament has n participants, and any two players play one game against each other\. Then it is true that in any given point of time, there are two players who have finished the same number of games\.

- Example 1\.5\. Ten points are given within a square of unit size\. Then there are two of them that are closer to each other than 0\.48, and there are three of them that can be covered by a disk of radius 0\.5\. Solution\.

- Example 1\.7\. Mr\. and Mrs\. Smith invited four couples to their home\. Some guests were friends of Mr\. Smith, and some others were friends of Mrs\. Smith\. When the guests arrived, people who knew each other beforehand shook hands, those who did not know each other just greeted each other\. After all this took place, the observant Mr\. Smith said "How interesting\. If you disregard me, there are no two people present who shook hands the same number of times"\. How many times did Mrs\. Smith shake hands?

- An obvious reformulation of that Example shows that it is simply impossible to have a party at which no two people shake hands the same number of times (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 29</a>)

- If we can complete both of these steps, then we will have proved our statement for all natural values of m\. Indeed, suppose not, that is, that we have completed the two steps described above, but still there are some positive integers for which our statement is not true (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=39" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 39</a>)

- discussion: that of the first n positive integers, that is, the set {1,2,3, ••• , n}\. As this set will be our canonical example, we introduce the notation [n] = {1,2,3, • • • , n\) for this set\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=43" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 43</a>)
- T h e o r e m 2\.4\. For all positive integers n, the number of all subsets of [n] is2 n \. Proof\.

- One common pitfall is to omit a careful proof of the Initial Step, then "prove" a faulty statement by a correct Induction Step\. For example, we could "prove" the faulty statement that all positive integers of the form In +1 are divisible by 2, if (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=43" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 43</a>)
- We claim that all horses have the same color\. As the number of all horses in the world is certainly finite, we can restate our claim as follows\. For any positive integer n, any n horses always have the same color (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=43" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 43</a>)
- These two sets have no intersection, so nothing forces the color of the horse in the first set to be the same as that of the horse in the second one!

- Example 2\.5\. Let the sequence {an} be defined by the relations ao = 0, and an+\ — a0 + ai + a 2 + • • • + an + n + 1 if n > 1\. Prove that for all positive integers n, the equality a„ = 2" 1 holds (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 44</a>)
- Definition 3\.1\. The arrangement of different objects into a linear order using each object exactly once is called a permutation of these objects\. The number n • \(n — 1\) • \(n — 2\) • • • 2 • 1 of all permutations of n objects is called n factorial, and is denoted by n!\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=58" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 58</a>)
- You may wonder how large this number is, in terms of n\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=58" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 58</a>)
- n! ~ v ^ \(-\) \. \(3\.1\) The symbol n! ~ z\(n\) sign means that limn\_>\.oo jfcx = 1Relation \(3\.1\) is called Stirling's formula, and we will use it in several later chapters\.

- The simplicity of the answer to the previous question was due to several factors: we used each of our objects exactly once, the order of the objects mattered, and the objects were all different\. In the rest of this section we will study problems without one or more of these simplifying factors\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=59" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 59</a>)
- This problem differs from the previous one in only one aspect: the objects are not all different\. The collection of the five red, three yellow, and two white flowers is often called a multiset\. A linear order that contains all the elements of a multiset exactly once is called a multiset permutation\.

- Theorem 3\.5\. Let n, k,01,02, •• • , a\* be non-negative integers satisfying Oi + 02 + • • • + Ofc = n\. Consider a multiset of n objects, in which ai objects are of type i, for all i 6 [k]\. Then the number of ways to linearly order these objects is n! ai! -a 2 ! a\*!'

- Definition 3\.8\. Let X and Y be two finite sets, and let / : X —> Y be a function so that \(1\) if f\(a\) = f\(b\), then a = b, and \(2\) for all y £ Y there is an x £ X so that f\(x\) — y, then we say that / is a bijection from X onto Y\.

- Definition 3\.9\. Let / : X —> Y be a function\. If / satisfies criterion \(1\) of Definition 3\.8, then we say that / is one-to-one or injective, or is an injection\. If / satisfies criterion \(2\) of Definition 3\.8, then we say that / is onto or surjective, or is a surjection\.

- Definition 3\.15\. The number of fc-element subsets of [n] is denoted \(?\) and is read "n choose fc"\. The numbers \(£\) are often called binomial coefficients, for reasons that will become clear in Chapter 4\. T h e o r e m 3\.16\.

- E x a m p l e 3\.19\. A medical student has to work in a hospital for five days in January\. However, he is not allowed to work two consecutive days in the hospital\. In how many different ways can he choose the five days he will work in the hospital? Solution\. The difficulty here is to make sure that we do not choose two consecutive days\. This can be assured by the following trick\. Let o-i, &i, 03; 0,4,05 be the dates of the five days of January that the student will spend in the hospital, in increasing order\. Note that the requirement that there are no two consecutive numbers among the aj, and 1 < a,{ < 31 for all % is equivalent to the requirement that l < a i < a?, — \ < a^ — 2 a\ — 3 < a5 — 4 < 27\. In other words, there is an obvious bijection between the set of 5-element subsets of [31] containing no two consecutive elements and the set of 5-element subsets of [27]\.

- Place the k boxes in a line, then place the balls in them in some way and align them in the middle of the boxes\. This creates a long line consisting of n balls and k — 1 walls separating the k boxes from each other\. Note that simply knowing in which order the n identical balls and k — 1 separating walls follow each other is the same as knowing the number of balls in each box\. So our task is reduced to finding the number of ways to permute the multiset consisting of n balls and k — 1 walls\.

- If this element forms a singleton block, then the remaining n— 1 elements have S\(n— 1, k — 1\) ways to complete the partition\. These partitions are enumerated by the first member of the right-hand side\. If, on the other hand, the element n does not form a block by itself, then the remaining n — 1 elements must form a partition with k blocks in one of S\(n — 1, k\) ways\. Then we can add n into any of the k blocks formed by this partition, multiplying the number of all our possibilities by k\. These partitions are enumerated by the second member of the right-hand side\. As the left-hand side enumerates all partitions of [n] into k blocks, the claim is proved\.

- To avoid such a waste of time and energy, it is best to find an explicit formula for an\.

- Note that while Theorems 8\.5 and 8\.21 sound very similar, they apply in different circumstances\. Theorem 8\.5 applies when [n] is split into two parts so that one part is [i]\. That is, [n] is split into intervals\. Theorem 8\.21 applies when [n] is split into two parts with no restrictions\. In other words, the first theorem applies when our objects are linearly ordered \(like days in a calendar, or people in a line\), and we cut that linear order somewhere to get two subsets\. The second theorem applies when we are free to choose our two subsets, that is, they do not have to be consecutive objects in a line\.

- Definition 16\.1\. Let P be a set, and let < be a relation on P so that \(a\) < is reflexive, that is, x < x, for all x G P, \(b\) < is transitive, that is, if x < y and y < z, then x < z, \(c\) < is antisymmetric, that is, if x < y and y < x, then x = y\. Then we say that P< = \(P, <\) is a partially ordered set, or poset\. We also say that < is a partial ordering of P\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=396" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 396</a>)
- If x G P is such that there is no y G P for which x < y, then we say that a; is a maximal element of P\. If for all z € P, z < x holds, then we say that x is the maximum element of P\. Minimal and minimum elements are defined accordingly\. The reader should verify that all finite posets have minimal and maximal elements\. Not all finite posets have minimum or maximum elements, however\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=397" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 397</a>)
- If x < y in a poset P, but there is no element z € P so that x < z < y, then we say that y covers x\. This notion enables us to formally define Hasse diagrams, the kind of diagrams we informally used in our introductory example (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=397" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 397</a>)
- The Hasse diagram of a finite poset P is a graph whose vertices represent the elements of the poset\. If x < y in P, then the vertex corresponding to y is above that corresponding to x\. If, in addition, y covers x, then there is an edge between x and y\.

- The dual notion is that of antichains\. If the subset S C P contains no two comparable elements, then we say that S is an antichain\. For example, {{2,3}, {1,3}, {3,4}, {2,4}} forms an antichain in B4 as none of these four sets contains another one\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=398" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 398</a>)
- A chain cover of a poset is a collection of disjoint chains whose union is the poset itself\. It seems plausible that if a poset has a large antichain, then it cannot be covered with just a few chains, and vice versa\. The following classic theorem shows the precise connection between the sizes of antichains and chain covers of a poset\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=399" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 399</a>)
- Just as for matchings, a chain, \(resp\. antichain\) X of P is called maximum if P has no larger chain \(resp\. antichain\) than X, and X is called maximal if it cannot be extended\. That is, no element can be added to X without destroying the chain \(resp\. antichain\) property of X\.

- Theorem 16\.8\. [Dilworth's Theorem] In a finite partially ordered set P, the size of any largest antichain is equal to the number of chains in any smallest chain cover\.

- If x < y are elements of P, then the set of all elements z satisfying x < z < y is called the closed interval between x and y, and is denoted by [x,y]\. If all intervals of P are finite, then P is called locally finite\. Note that this does not necessarily mean that P itself is finite\. The set of all positive integers with the usual ordering provides a counterexample\.

- Proposition 16\.12\. Let x < y be elements of the locally finite poset P\. Then the number of multichains x = XQ < x\ < x-x < • • • < Xk = y is equal to\( k \(x,y\)\.

- Definition 16\.14\. The inverse of the zeta function of P is called the Mobius function of P, and is denoted by /i = /ip\.

- It turns out that the inverse of the zeta function of P is even more important than the zeta function itself\. Therefore, it has its own name\.

- The major application of the Mobius function, the Mobius Inversion Formula, will generalize this idea for any locally finite poset P \. Theorem 16\.21\. [Mobius Inversion Formula] Let P be a poset in which each principal ideal is finite, and let f : P —> R be a function\. Let g : P —> R be defined by Then <?\(</\) = £ / \( \* \) • x<y f\(v\) = ^9\(x\)fJ,\(x,y\)\. x<y (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Miklos Bona/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory (404)/A Walk Through Combinatorics_ An Introduct - Miklos Bona.pdf#page=407" target="_blank">Miklos Bona 407</a>)
- There is a natural class of partial ordered sets called lattices for which additional techniques to compute the values of the Mobius functions are available\. Let P be a poset, and let x 6 P\. If a; <p a, then we say that a is an upper bound for x\. If b <p x, then we say that b is a lower bound for x\.

- Definition 16\.25\. A poset L is called a lattice if any two elements x and y of L have a minimum common upper bound a, and a maximum common lower bound b\.

- In this case, a is called the join of x and y, and b is called the meet of x and y\. We denote these relations by x V y = a, and x Ay = b\.

- A finite lattice always has a minimum and a maximum element, as we show in Exercise 7\. This is not necessarily true in infinite lattices\. For example, the lattice of all finite subsets of N does not have a maximum element, or even a maximal element, for that matter\.

- Proposition 16\.29\. If x, y, and t are elements of a lattice L, and x < t, and y < t, then xVy<t also holds\. Similarly, if r € L, and x > r, and y > r, then x Ay > r\.

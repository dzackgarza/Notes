How orthogonal matrices make least squares solutions much easier. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Steven J.

Once these coordinates have been determined, they can be used to compute v. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Steven J.

An n × n matrix Q is orthogonal if and only if QTQ = I (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Steven J. Leon/Linear Algebra With Applications (675)/Linear Algebra With Applications - Steven J. Leon.pdf#page=268" target="_blank">Steven J. Leon 268</a>)</p>
If the column vectors of A form an orthonormal set of vectors in Rm , then ATA = I and the solution to the least squares problem is x̂ = AT b (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Steven J.

What if the columns of A are not orthonormal? In the next section we will learn a method for finding an orthonormal basis for R(A). From this method we will obtain a factorization of A into a product QR, where Q has an orthonormal set of column vectors and R is upper triangular. With this factorization, the least squares problem is easily solved. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Steven J.

However, the main difficulty with this method is that, in forming the normal equations, we may well end up transforming the problem into an ill-conditioned one (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Steven J.

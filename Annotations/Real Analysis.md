## Highlights

- However, the above relationship between functions and their Fourier coefficients is not completely reciprocal when limited to Riemann integrable functions\. Thus if we consider the space R of such functions with its square norm, and the space `2 \(Z\) with its norm,1 each element f in R assigns a corresponding element {an } in `2 \(Z\), and the two norms are identical\. However, it is easy to construct elements in `2 \(Z\) that do not correspond to functions in R\. Note also that the space `2 \(Z\) is complete in its norm, while R is not\.2 Thus we are led to two questions: \(i\) What are the putative “functions” f that arise when we complete R? In other words: given an arbitrary sequence {an } ∈ `2 \(Z\) what is the nature of the \(presumed\) function f corresponding to these coefficients? \(ii\) How do we integrate such functions f \(and in particular verify \(1\)\)? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 17</a>)
- ∞ X n=−∞ |an | 2 = 1 2π Z π −π |f \(x\)| 2 dx\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 17</a>)
- f ∼ nt P an einx by \(1\) an = 1 2π Z π −π f \(x\)e −inx dx, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 17</a>)
- f ∼ nt P an einx by \(1\) an = 1 2π Z π −π f \(x\)e −inx dx, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 17</a>)
- f ∼ nt P an einx by \(1\) an = 1 2π Z π −π f \(x\)e −inx dx, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 17</a>)
- what method of integration can be used to integrate f and obtain that for it Z 1 0 f \(x\) dx = lim n→∞ Z 1 0 fn \(x\) dx ? It is with Lebesgue integration that we can solve both this problem and the previous one\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 18</a>)
- f increasing t\. We say that Γ is rectifiable if its length L is finite (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 18</a>)
- \(i\) What are the conditions on the functions x\(t\) and y\(t\) that guarantee the rectifiability of Γ? \(ii\) When these are satisfied, does the formula \(2\) hold? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 18</a>)
- a continuous curve Γ in the plane, given parametrically by Γ = {\(x\(t\), y\(t\)\)}, a ≤ t ≤ b, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 18</a>)
- The first question has a complete answer in terms of the notion of functions of “bounded variation\.” As to the second, it turns out that if x and y are of bounded variation, the integral \(2\) is always meaningful; however, the equality fails in general, but can be restored under appropriate reparametrization of the curve Γ\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=18" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 18</a>)
- the existence of continuous functions F that are nowhere differentiable, or for which F 0 \(x\) exists for every x, but F 0 is not integrable, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 19</a>)
- After some preliminaries we pass to the first important definition, that of exterior measure for any subset E of Rd \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 22</a>)
- \. This is given in terms of approximations by unions of cubes that cover E\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 22</a>)
- the class of measurable functions is closed under pointwise limits\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 22</a>)
- the collection of measurable sets is closed under complements and countable unions, and the measure is additive if the subsets in the union are disjoin (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=22" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 22</a>)
- in R every open set is a countable union of disjoint open intervals, while in Rd , d ≥ 2, every open set is “almost” the disjoint union of closed cubes, in the sense that only the boundaries of the cubes can overlap\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=23" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 23</a>)
- A set E is bounded if it is contained in some ball of finite radius\. A bounded set is compact if it is also closed\. Compact sets enjoy the Heine-Borel covering property: • Assume E is compact, E ⊂ S α Oα , and each Oα is open\. Then there are finitely many of the open sets, Oα1 , Oα2 , \. \. \. , OαN , such SN that E ⊂ fin S N j=1 Oαj \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 24</a>)
- A point x ∈ Rd is a limit point of the set E if for every r > 0, the ball Br \(x\) contains points of E\. This means that there are points in E which are arbitrarily close to x\. An isolated point of E is a point x ∈ E such that there exists an r > 0 where Br \(x\) ∩ E is equal to {x}\. A point x ∈ E is an interior point of E if there exists r > 0 such that Br \(x\) ⊂ E\. The set of all interior points of E is called the interior of E\. Also, the closure E of the E consists of the union of E and all its limit points\. The boundary of a set E, denoted by ∂E, is the set of points which are in the closure of E but not in the interior of E\. Note that the closure of a set is a closed set; every point in E is a limit point of E; and a set is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points\. Finally, a closed set E is perfect if E does not have any isolated points\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 24</a>)
- A union of rectangles is said to be almost disjoint if the interiors of the rectangles are disjoint\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 25</a>)
- Lemma 1\.1 If a rectangleSis the almost disjoint union of finitely many other rectangles, say R = S N k=1 Rk , then |R| = N X k=1 |Rk |\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=25" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 25</a>)
- Lemma 1\.2 If R, R1 , \. \. \. , RN are rectangles, and R ⊂ S N k=1 Rk , then |R| ≤ N X k=1 |Rk |\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=27" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 27</a>)
- Theorem 1\.3 Every open subset O of R can be writen uniquely as a countable union of disjoint open intervals\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=27" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 27</a>)
- Theorem 1\.4 Every open subset O of Rd , d ≥ 1, can be written as a countable union of almost disjoint closed cubes\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=28" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 28</a>)
- The Cantor set C is by definition the intersection of all Ck ’s: C= ∞ \ k=0 Ck \. The set C is not empty, since all end-points of the intervals in Ck \(all k\) belong to C\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 30</a>)
- For instance, C is closed and bounded, hence compact\. Also, C is totally disconnected: given any x, y ∈ C there exists z ∈ / C that lies between x and y\. Finally, C is perfect: it has no isolated points \(Exercise 1\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 30</a>)
- For instance, in terms of cardinality the Cantor set is rather large: it is not countable\. Since it can be mapped to the interval [0, 1], the Cantor set has the cardinality of the continuum \(Exercise 2\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 30</a>)
- Indeed, Ck is a disjoint union of 2k intervals of length (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=30" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 30</a>)
- 3−k , making the total length of Ck equal to \(2/3\)k \. But C ⊂ Ck for all k, and \(2/3\)k → 0 as k tends to infinity\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 31</a>)
- However, the exterior measure lacks the desirable property of additivity when taking the union of disjoint sets\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 31</a>)
- The exterior measure, as the name indicates, attempts to describe the volume of a set E by approximating it from the outside\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 31</a>)
- The precise definition is as follows: if E is any subset of Rd , the exterior measure1 of E is \(1\) m∗ \(E\) = inf ∞ X j=1 |Qj |, where the infimum is taken over all countable coverings E ⊂ S ∞ j=1 Qj by closed cubes\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 31</a>)
- Example 1\. The exterior measure of a point is zero\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=32" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 32</a>)
- Example 2\. The exterior measure of a closed cube is equal to its volume\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=32" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 32</a>)
- Example 3\. If Q is an open cube, the result m∗ \(Q\) = |Q| still holds\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=32" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 32</a>)
- Example 4\. The exterior measure of a rectangle R is equal to its volume\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=33" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 33</a>)
- Example 5\. The exterior measure of Rd is infinite\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=33" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 33</a>)
- Example 6\. The Cantor set C has exterior measure 0\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=33" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 33</a>)
- For every ² > 0, there exists a covering E ⊂ S ∞ j=1 Qj with ∞ X j=1 m∗ \(Qj \) ≤ m∗ \(E\) + ²\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=34" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 34</a>)
- Observation 1 \(Monotonicity\) If E1 ⊂ E2 , then m∗ \(E1 \) ≤ m∗ \(E2 \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=34" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 34</a>)
- Observation 2 \(Countable sub-additivity\) If E = S ∞ j=1 Ej , then m∗ \(E\) ≤ P ∞ j=1 m∗ \(Ej \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=34" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 34</a>)
- Observation 3 If E ⊂ Rd , then m∗ \(E\) = inf m∗ \(O\), where the infimum is taken over all open sets O containing E\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=34" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 34</a>)
- Observation 4 If E = E1 ∪ E2 , and d\(E1 , E2 \) > 0, then m∗ \(E\) = m∗ \(E1 \) + m∗ \(E2 \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=35" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 35</a>)
- Observation 5 If a set E is the countable union of almost disjoint cubes E = er S ∞ j=1 Qj , then m∗ \(E\) = ∞ X j=1 |Qj |\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=36" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 36</a>)
- This last property shows that if a set can be decomposed into almost disjoint cubes, its exterior measure equals the sum of the volumes of the cubes\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=36" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 36</a>)
- Despite observations 4 and 5, one cannot conclude in general that if E1 ∪ E2 is a disjoint union of subsets of Rd , then \(3\) m∗ \(E1 ∪ E2 \) = m∗ \(E1 \) + m∗ \(E2 \)\. In fact \(3\) holds when the sets in question are not highly irregular or “pathological” but are measurable in the sense described below\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 37</a>)
- The notion of measurability isolates a collection of subsets in Rd for which the exterior measure satisfies all our desired properties, including additivity \(and in fact countable additivity\) for disjoint unions of sets\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 37</a>)
- A subset E of Rd is Lebesgue measurable, or simply measurable, if for any ² > 0 there exists an open set O with E ⊂ O and m∗ \(O − E\) ≤ ²\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 37</a>)
- If E is measurable, we define its Lebesgue measure \(or measure\) m\(E\) by m\(E\) = m∗ \(E\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 37</a>)
- Property 1 Every open set in Rd is measurable\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 37</a>)
- In particular, we shall prove that the collection of measurable sets behave well under the various operations of set theory: countable unions, countable intersections, and complements\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=37" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 37</a>)
- Property 2 If m∗ \(E\) = 0, then E is measurable\. In particular, if F is a subset of a set of exterior measure 0, then F is measurable\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 38</a>)
- As a consequence of this property, we deduce that the Cantor set C in Example 6 is measurable and has measure 0\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 38</a>)
- Property 3 A countable union of measurable sets is measurable\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 38</a>)
- Property 4 Closed sets are measurable\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 38</a>)
- First, we observe that it suffices to prove that compact sets are measurable\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 38</a>)
- Indeed, S∞any closed set F can be written as the union of compact sets, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=38" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 38</a>)
- Lemma 3\.1 If F is closed, K is compact, and these sets are disjoint, then d\(F, K\) > 0\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=39" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 39</a>)
- Property 5 The complement of a measurable set is measurable\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=39" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 39</a>)
- Property 6 A countable intersection of measurable sets is measurable\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=39" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 39</a>)
- We point out that we have shown more than simply closure with respect to finite unions and intersections: we have proved that the collection of measurable sets is closed under countable unions and intersections\. This passage from finite operations to infinite ones is crucial in the context of analysis\. We emphasize, however, that the operations of uncountable unions or intersections are not permissible when dealing with measurable sets! (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=40" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 40</a>)
- Theorem S∞ 3\.2 If E1 , E2 , \. \. \., are disjoint measurable sets, and E = T S ∞ j=1 Ej , then m\(E\) = ∞ X j=1 m\(Ej \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=40" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 40</a>)
- Rd that increases If E1 , E2 , \. \. \. is a countable collection of subsets of S to E in the sense that Ek ⊂ Ek+1 for all k, and E = R S ∞ k=1 Ek , then we write Ek % E\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=41" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 41</a>)
- Similarly, if ET1 , E2 , \. \. \. decreases to E in the sense that Ek ⊃ Ek+1 for all k, and E = T1 ∞ k=1 Ek , we write Ek & E\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=41" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 41</a>)
- Corollary 3\.3 Suppose E1 , E2 , \. \. \. are measurable subsets of Rd \. \(i\) If Ek % E, then m\(E\) = limN →∞ m\(EN \)\. \(ii\) If Ek & E and m\(Ek \) < ∞ for some k, then m\(E\) = lim N →∞ m\(EN \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=41" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 41</a>)
- Its thrust is that, in effect, an arbitrary measurable set can be well approximated by the open sets that contain it, and alternatively, by the closed sets it contains\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=42" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 42</a>)
- Theorem 3\.4 Suppose E is a measurable subset of Rd \. Then, for every ² > 0: \(i\) There exists an open set O with E ⊂ O and m\(O − E\) ≤ ²\. \(ii\) There exists a closed set F with F ⊂ E and m\(E − F \) ≤ ²\. \(iii\) If m\(E\) is finite, there exists a compact set K with K ⊂ E and m\(E − K\) ≤ ²\. \(iv\) If m\(E\) is finite, there exists a finite union F = S N j=1 Qj of closed cubes such that m\(E4F \) ≤ ²\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=42" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 42</a>)
- The notation E4F stands for the symmetric difference between the sets E and F , defined by E4F = \(E − F \) ∪ \(F − E\), which consists of those points that belong to only one of the two sets E or F \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=42" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 42</a>)
- We can then assert that δE is measurable whenever E is, and m\(δE\) = δ d m\(E\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=43" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 43</a>)
- In the same way one can prove the relative dilation-invariance of Lebesgue measure\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=43" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 43</a>)
- One can also easily see that Lebesgue measure is reflection-invariant\. That is, whenever E is measurable, so is −E = {−x : x ∈ E} and m\(−E\) = m\(E\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=43" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 43</a>)
- A σ-algebra of sets is a collection of subsets of Rd that is closed under countable unions, countable intersections, and complements\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 44</a>)
- A more interesting and relevant example consists of all measurable sets in Rd , which we have just shown also forms a σ-algebra\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 44</a>)
- Another σ-algebra, which plays a vital role in analysis, is the Borel σ-algebra in Rd , denoted by BRd , which by definition is the smallest σalgebra that contains all open sets\. Elements of this σ-algebra are called Borel sets\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 44</a>)
- Since we observe that any intersection \(not necessarily countable\) of σ-algebras is again a σ-algebra, we may define BRd as the intersection of all σ-algebras that contain the open sets\. This shows the existence and uniqueness of the Borel σ-algebra\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 44</a>)
- Since open sets are measurable, we conclude that the Borel σ-algebra is contained in the σ-algebra of measurable sets\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 44</a>)
- do there exist Lebesgue measurable sets which are not Borel sets? The answer is “yes\.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 44</a>)
- From the point of view of the Borel sets, the Lebesgue sets arise as the completion of the σ-algebra of Borel sets, that is, by adjoining all subsets of Borel sets of measure zero\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=44" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 44</a>)
- Starting with the open and closed sets, which are the simplest Borel sets, one could try to list the Borel sets in order of their complexity\. Next in order would come countable intersections of open sets; such sets are called Gδ sets\.

- SupposeR fn ≥ 0 and fn \(x\) → f \(x\) for almost every x\. Is it true that n: R fn dx → R f dx ? Unfortunately, the example that follows provides a negative answer to this, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=81" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 81</a>)

- Both the integrability of f , and the value of its integral are unchanged if we modify f arbitrarily on a set of measure zero\. It is therefore useful to adopt the convention that in the context of integration we allow our functions to be undefined on sets of measure zero (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Stein/Real Analysis (725)/Real Analysis - Stein.pdf#page=86" target="_blank">Stein & Shakarchi 86</a>)

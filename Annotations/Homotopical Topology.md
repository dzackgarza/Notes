## Highlights

- Anyhow, we acquire the right to use without explanations terms like “Hausdorff space,” or “compact space,” or “countable base space,” and so on, and also use \(explicitly or implicitly\) facts like “a bijective continuous map of a compact space onto a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism,” or “a compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed\.” (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 14</a>)
- The symbol R1 always means the union \(inductive limit\) of the chain R1  R2  R3  : : : ; thus, R1 is the set of sequences \.x1 ; x2 ; x3 ; : : : / (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 14</a>)
- Show that none of the spaces R1 ; S1 ; D1 is metrizable\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 15</a>)
- There are other definitions of R1 in the literature\. For example, \(1\) the “Hilbert space” e” P ` for which the series 2 2 is the set of all real sequences \.x1 ; x2 ; x3 ; : : : / xi converges;Pthe topology is defined by the metric d2 \.\.x1 ; x2 ; x3 ; : : : /; \.y1 ; y2 ; y3 ; : : : // D \.yi  xi /2 ; \(2\) the Tychonoff space T is the set of all real sequences \.x1 ; x2 ; x3 ; : : : / with the base of topology formed by the sets f\.x1 ; x2 ; x3 ; : : : / 2 T j \.x1 ; : : : ; xn / 2 Ug for all n and all open U  Rn [a sequence Xi D \.xi1 ; xi2 ; xi3 ; : : : / in T converges to X D \.x1 ; x2 ; x3 ; : : : / 2 T if and only if limi!1 xin D xn for every n]\.

- Which of the inclusion maps R1 ! `2 ; R1 ! T; `2 ! T \(if any\) are continuous? Which of them \(if any\) are homeomorphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 15</a>)
- EXERCISE 6\. Prove that the real projective line is homeomorphic to the circle S1 \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 15</a>)
- The points with xi ¤ 0 form the ith principal affine chart\. The correspondence \.x0 W x1 W    W x n / $ \.x0 =xi ; : : : ; xi 1 =xi :xiC1 =xi ; : : : ; xn =xi / yields a homeomorphism of the affine chart onto Rn and equips the former with coordinates\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 15</a>)
- If we assign to a point of Sn  RnC1 a line passing through this point and the origin, we get a continuous map Sn ! RPn (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 16</a>)
- Thus, RPn may also be obtained from Dn by identifying all pairs of opposite points on the boundary sphere (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 16</a>)
- Like RPn , the space CPn is covered by n C 1 affine charts (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 16</a>)
- We call a topology weaker if it has more open sets, that is, fewer limit points \(for us, the weakest topology is the discrete topology\)\. Informally speaking, we call a topology weak if the attraction forces between the points are weak\. The opposite terminology considers points as repelling each other; from this point of view, the discrete topology is the strongest\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=16" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 16</a>)
- EXERCISE 7\. Prove that projective lines CP1 and HP1 are homeomorphic, respec2 and S4 tively, to S2 and S4 \. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 17</a>)
- We get a definition of a quaternionic projective space HPn \. One should notice, however, that , because of noncommutativity of the algebra H, one has to distinguish between left and right lines\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 17</a>)
- but even such an exotic object as the Cayley projective plane are very important for topology\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 17</a>)
- Suppose that in some space Rn two operations are defined: multiplication, a; b 7! ab, and conjugation, a 7! a\. Then we define similar operations in R2n D Rn  Rn by the formulas \.a; b/  \.c; d/ D \.ac  bd; bc C ad/; \.a; b/ D \.a; b/: Starting from the usual multiplication and identical conjugation \.a D a/ in R 1 D R, we get \(bilinear\) multiplications and conjugations in R2 ; R4 ; R8 ; R16 ; : : : (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 17</a>)
- The multiplication in R4 is the multiplication of quaternions\. It is bilinear, associative, and admits a unique division \(that is, the equation ax D b has a unique solution if a ¤ 0\) but is not commutative\. The multiplication in R8 is still worse: Not only it is not commutative, but also it is not associative [although the associativity relations involving only two letters, such as \.ab/a D a\.ba/; \.ab/b D ab2 ; \.ab/a 1 D a\.ba 1 /, etc\., hold]\. Still this multiplication possesses a unique division\. The algebra R 8 with this multiplication is called the Cayley algebra or octonion algebra and is denoted as Ca\.

- Much later in this book we will consider \(and prove\) the famous Frobenius conjecture: If the space Rn possesses a bilinear multiplication with a unique division, then n D 1; 2; 4, or 8\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 17</a>)
- there are, for example, nonassociative bilinear multiplications with a unique division in R4 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 17</a>)
- The nonassociativity of the Cayley multiplication impedes defining any lines in the space Can with n  3\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 17</a>)

End\.Rn / which assigns to a P 2 G\.n; k/ the orthogonal projection Rn ! P combined with the inclusion map P !

- There are obvious complex and quaternionic versions of the equalities G\.n; k/ D G\.n; n  k/; G\.n; 1/ D RPn 1 ; also, GC \.n; k/ D GC \.n; n  k/ and GC \.n; 1/ D Sn 1 \. The embeddings G\.n; k/ ! G\.n C 1; k/ and G\.n; k/ ! G\.n C 1; k C 1/ also have complex, quaternionic, and oriented analogs\.

- The compact classical groups include the group O\.n/ of orthogonal n  n matrices, the group U\.n/ of unitary n  n matrices, the groups SO\.n/ and SU\.n/ of matrices from O\.n/ and U\.n/ with determinant 1, and the group Sp\.n/ of quaternionic matrices of unitary transformations of Hn \.

- ; the homeomorphism assigns to counterclockwise rotation by an angle ˛   of R3 around an oriented axis ` a point of ` at the distance ˛= from the origin \(in the positive direction\)\. Since the rotation by the angle  around an oriented axis is not different from the rotation by the angle  around the same axis with the opposite orientation, the image of this map is the unit ball in R3 with the opposite points on the boundary identifie (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 20</a>)

- Finally, the groups U\.1/ and Sp\.1/, which are isomorphic, respectively, to the groups SO\.2/ and SU\.2/, are homeomorphic to S 1 and S 3 \.

- The spaces of orthonormal k-frames in Rn \(topologized as a subset of Rn      Rn \) is called the Stiefel manifold and is denoted as V\.n; k/\.

- The action of the group O\.n/ in Rn gives rise to its actions in Sn 1 ; Dn ; G\.n; k/; and V\.n; k/\. The subgroup SO\.n/ of O\.n/ acts also in GC \.n; k/\. There is also an action of O\.k/ in V\.n; k/: The matrices from O\.k/ are applied to the vectors of the frame\.

- Thus, almost all classical spaces described above are homogeneous spaces of compact classical groups; that is, they can be described as quotient spaces of these groups over some subgroups\. Here are these descriptions: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=21" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 21</a>)

- The set C\.X; Y/ of all continuous maps of a space X into a space Y is furnished by compact–open topology \(which can be thought of as the topology of uniform convergency on compact sets (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=33" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 33</a>)
- The base of open sets of this topology consists of sets of the form U\.K; O/, where K is a compact subset of X and O is an open subset of Y; the set U\.K; O/ consists of continuous maps f W X !

- For example, the cone over a space X with a base point x0 is obtained from the usual cone CX by collapsing the segment x0  I to a point which is chosen for the base point of the modified cone; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=35" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 35</a>)
- Suspensions and joins are modified in a similar way \(in the join the segment joining the base points is collapsed to a point\), and the images of segments collapsed are taken for the base points; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=35" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 35</a>)
- For a base point space X D \.X; x0 / the path space EX is defined as the space E\.X; x0 / of paths beginning at x0 , and the loop space X is defined as the space \.X; x0 / of loops beginning \(and ending\) at x0 ; (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=35" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 35</a>)
- Alternatively, one can define the bouquet X \_ Y as the subspace of the product X  Y composed of points \.x; y/ for which x D x0 or y D y0 \.

- We say that a subspace A of a topological space X is contractible in X if the inclusion map A ! X is homotopic to a constant map A ! X\. It is clear that if A is contractible \(in our usual sense; see Sect\. 3\.3\), then it is contractible in X, but the converse is not necessarily true (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=42" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 42</a>)
- We consider the invariants of two different kinds: X 7! \.X; Y/ and X 7! \.Y; X/ \(for a fixed Y\)\. Each of these kinds gives rise to a theory, and, for a long time, the two theories remain parallel or, better to say, dual\.

- But we encounter an unexpected obstacle when we try to introduce a CW structure into a product and, the more so, smash product or join of two CW complexes\.

- The CW decomposition of the Grassmann manifold G\.n; k/ described below is very important in topology \(in particular, for the theory of characteristic classes; see Lecture 19 ahead\) and also in algebra, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics\.

- There is a remarkable property of Schubert cells: Embeddings of G\.n; k/ to G\.n C 1; k/ and G\.n C 1; n C 1/ map every cell e\.m1 ; : : : ; ms / onto a cell with the same notation\. For this reason, the spaces G\.1; k/ and G\.1; 1/ are decomposed into cells corresponding to Young diagrams: In the second case they correspond to all Young diagrams, while in the first case they correspond to Young diagrams contained in the infinite horizontal half-strip of height k\.

- In particular, the manifold F\.nI 1; : : : ; n  1/ of full flags is decomposed into the union of cells corresponding to usual permutations of numbers 1; : : : ; n, and the dimension of a cell is equal to the number of inversions in a permutation\.

Thus, we see that the triviality of the homotopy groups, as well as the triviality of the homology groups, implies the homotopy triviality \(contractibility\) of a simply connected CW complex\. At the same time, we have the examples which show that neither the triviality of induced homotopy groups homomorphisms nor the triviality of induced homology homomorphisms secures homotopy triviality of a continuous map\.

- EXERCISE 10\. The space XAb is called an Abelianization, or Quillenization, of a path connected space X if the fundamental group of XAb is Abelian and there exists a continuous map X !

- But there are several remarkable examples of the Abelianization, two of which we will mention\. The first was discovered in 1971 by M\. Barratt, D\. Kahn, and S\. Priddy: The Abelianization of the space X D K\.S1 ; 1/, where S1 D [n Sn is the group of finite permutations of the set Z>0 , is XAb D \.1 S1 /0 D [n \.n Sn /0 \(the subscript 0 indicates that we consider only one component of the set\)\.

- Remark\. Our definition of an Abelianization is a simplified version of a more common definition in which the space XAb is assumed simple \(see Sect\. 8\.2\), or even an H-space \(see Exercise 2 in Sect\. 8\.2\) or even a loop space \(s (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=193" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 193</a>)
- This enhanced definition of an Abelianization plays an important technical role in one of the versions of constructing an algebraic K-functor\. The problem of the existence of an Abelianization in this sense is much more complicated, and there are no general theorems about it\.

- Proof\. We may assume that f is an embedding, so \.Y; X/ is a topological pair\.

- In other words, this homomorphism sends a cohomology class 2 H n \.XI G/ to a homomorphism ˛ 7! h ; ˛i of Hn \.X/ into G\. The fact that this homomorphism is onto yields the following important proposition\. Corollary 1\. For every homomorphism f W Hn \.X/ ! G, there exists a cohomology class 2 H n \.XI G/ such that f \.˛/ D h ; ˛i for every ˛ 2 Hn \.G/\. Remark also that this is defined up to an element of Ext\.Hn \.X/; G/; in particular, if Hn \.X/ and G are finitely generated, then this Ext group is finite, so is defined by f up to adding an element of finite order\.

- Thus, the transition from the integral coefficients to the rational, real, or complex coefficients kills the torsion\.

- At this moment, however, the difference between homology and cohomology becomes important\. For any topological space X, there exists the diagonal map W X ! X  X; \.x/ D \.x; x/\. This maps induces homomorphisms  W Hn \.XI G/ ! Hn \.X  XI G/;   W H n \.X  XI G/ ! H n \.XI G/I of these homomorphisms; the first one is useless for us now, but the second one provides cohomological multiplication: For 1 2 H n1 \.XI G/; 2 2 H n2 \.XI G/, we put 1 ^ 2 D  \. 1 ˝ 2/ 2 H n1 Cn2 \.XI G/: \(The classical notation ^, “cup,” is not very convenient, so often instead of 1 ^ 2 we will simply write 1 2 \.\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=216" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 216</a>)
- However, this way of defining the cohomological product has two important disadvantages\. First, we must still prove the independence of the CW structure\. Second, the diagonal map is not cellular (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=216" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 216</a>)
- \. To avoid these difficulties we will use the opposite order of the definition\. First, we will define a ^-product \(usually called the cup-product \) by a singular, topologically invariant, construction, and then we will use it to define the cross-product\.

- The proof of this theorem is based on the Hopf invariant, which is an integer assigned to every element of ' 2 4n 1 \.S2n /\. Its definition is as follows\.

- Consider a spheroid f W S4n 1 ! S2n and form the space X' D S 2n [f D4n \(aka the cone of f \)\. The space X' depends, up to a homotopy equivalence, only on ' \(which justifies the notation\)\. It has a natural CW structure with three cells of dimensions 0; 2n; and 4n\. Thus,  q Z for q D 0; 2n; 4n; q H \.X' I Z/ D 0 for q ¤ 0; 2n; 4n: The groups H 2n \.X' I Z/; H 4n \.X' I Z/ \(isomorphic to Z\) have natural generators \(determined by the canonical orientations of S2n and D4n \), and we denote these generators by a and b\.

- Remark 5\. Lemma 2 shows that the image of the Hopf homomorphism hW 4n 1 \.S 2n / ! Z is either the whole group Z or the group of even integers\. The choice between these two options is reduced to the question: Does 4n 1 \.S2n / contain an element with the Hopf invariant one? This question has several remarkable equivalent statements\. For example, it is possible to show that Sm possesses an H-space structure if and only if m is odd, that is, m D 2n  1, and 4n 1 \.S2n / contains an element with the Hopf invariant one\. The same condition is necessary and sufficient for the existence in RmC1 of a bilinear multiplication with a unique division\. The combination of Lemma 2 and Exercise 7 in Lecture 10 shows that the Hopf invariant of the Hopf class 2 2 3 \.S2 / equals 1 \(this corresponds to the complex number multiplication in R2 or to the natural group structure in S1 \)\.

- A set of charts which cover the manifold is called an atlas\. An atlas is called smooth \(analytic\) if such functions are all transition functions between charts of this atlas\. Two smooth \(analytic\) atlases are called smoothly \(analytically\) equivalent if their union is smooth \(analytic\) atlas\. A class of equivalent smooth \(analytic\) atlases is called a smooth \(analytic\) structure on a manifold\. A manifold with a smooth \(analytic\) structure is called a smooth \(analytic\) manifold\.

- There are two fundamental theorems in the theory of smooth manifolds \(also called differential topology \)\. Theorem 1\. Every smooth manifold is diffeomorphic \(that is, homeomorphic with preserving the smooth structure\) to a smooth surface in an Euclidean space\. Theorem 2\. Every compact smooth manifold is homeomorphic to a triangulated subset of an Euclidean space, and the homeomorphism can be made smooth on every simplex of the triangulation\.

- Remarks\. \(1\) In both theorems, the dimension of the Euclidean space can be as small as twice the dimension of the manifold\. \(2\) Theorem 2 also holds for noncompact manifolds, but the triangulation in this case has to be infinite\.

- Theorem 1 is proved in many textbooks in differential topology\. Its proof is not hard\. The situation with Theorem 2 is worse\. Since the 1920s, the topologist regarded this fact as obvious\. There are many geometric approaches to this result which look promising (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=230" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 230</a>)
- g\. For example, take a compact smooth surface in an Euclidean space and decompose this space into a union of small cubes\. If the decomposition satisfies some general position condition with respect to the surface, we can expect that the intersections of the surface with the cubes will be close to convex polyhedra and we can easily triangulate these polyhedra\. Or, choose a random finite subset of the smooth surface which is sufficiently dense, and take the Dirichlet domain; again we should get a subdivision of the surface into smooth polyhedra\. However, numerous attempts to make this proof rigorous turned out to be unsuccessful\. The first flawless proof of this theorem \(actually, of a stronger relative result\) was given in the 1930s by H\. Whitney\.

- Thus, a smoothly triangulated connected smooth manifold without boundary is a pseudomanifold\. The converse is wrong: A pseudomanifold is not always a manifold\. See the simplest example in Fig\. 66\.

- This proof provides a canonical generator for the group Hn \.X/ for a compact oriented pseudomanifold X: This is the homology class of the cycle, which is the sum of all n-dimensional simplices of X with orientations compatible with the orientation of X and with the coefficients all equal to 1\. This homology class is called the fundamental class of X \(and the cycle is called the fundamental cycle \)\.

- A more popular question arises in the topology of manifolds: If Y is a manifold and ˛ 2 Hn \.Y/, then when is it possible to find a closed oriented n-dimensional submanifold X of Y \(we assume that the reader understands what it is\) such that the homomorphism induced by the inclusion map sends ŒX into ˛ \(as people say, X realizes ˛\)?

- There are many remarkable results regarding submanifold realizations; for example, for any homology class ˛ of a manifold, there exists a number N such that N˛ can be realized by a submanifold\. \(For this result and other results, see the classical paper by Thom [84]\.\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=234" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 234</a>)

- For us, the most important will be the case when X is triangulated\. Recall that the star St\.s/ of a simplex s of triangulation is the union of simplices that contain s\. The link Lk\.s/ is the union of faces of simplices that contain s opposite to s\. Figure 67 shows examples of stars and links of a vertex and a one-dimensional simplex of the standard triangulation of the plane\.

- Proposition 2\. Every connected n-dimensional homology manifold is an n-dimensional pseudomanifold\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=236" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 236</a>)

- Remark 4\. A homology manifold is not always a topological manifold\. For example, there are manifolds with the same homology as a sphere, but not simply connected \(the best known example is the Poincaré sphere defined in S5 D f\.z1 ; z2 ; z3 / 2 C3 j jz 1 j2 C jz2 j2 C jz3 j2 D 1g by the equation z51 C z32 C z23 D 0\)\. The suspension over such a manifold is a homology manifold, but no neighborhoods of vertices are homeomorphic to a Euclidean space\.

- in the oriented case\. It turns out that these noncanonical isomorphisms reflect a very canonical duality called Poincaré duality which is much more classical than Poincaré isomorphisms (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=241" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 241</a>)

- The integer \.c X 1 ; c2 / D ki `i D hD 1 c1 ; c2 i i is called the intersection number of c1 and c2 \. It follows from the last formula and the properties of Poincaré isomorphism that the intersection number of two cycles depends only on the homology classes of these cycles, and we can speak of intersection numbers of homology classes: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=241" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 241</a>)
- A remarkable property of the intersection numbers is their geometric visualizability\. A simplex and its barycentric star transversely intersect each other at one point, so the intersection number of two cycles may be regarded as the number of their intersection points taken with the signs determined by their orientations\. This statement has a convenient differential statement\.

- Theorem 1\. Let X be a smooth closed oriented n-dimensional manifold, and let ˛ 1 2 Hm \.X/; ˛2 2 Hn m \.X/\. Let Y1 and Y2 be closed oriented submanifolds of X of dimensions m and n  m which realize ˛1 and ˛2 in the sense that ˛1 D \.i 1 / ŒY1  and ˛2 D \.i2 / ŒY2  where i1 ; i2 are inclusion maps\. We assume also that Y 1 ; Y2 are in general position \(which means that they intersect in finitely many points and transverse to each other at each of these points\)\. We assign a sign to every intersection point: plus if the orientations of Y1 and Y2 \(in this order\) compose the orientation of X at this point, and minus otherwise\. Then the intersection number \.˛ 1 ; ˛2 / equals to the number of the intersection points of Y1 and Y2 counted with the signs described above\.

- If X is a complex manifold, that is, its charts are maps into Cn and the transition maps are holomorphic, then X possesses a natural, “complex,” orientation\. The matter is that the Jacobian of a holomorphic map Cn ! Cn regarded as a smooth map R2n ! R2n is equal to the square of the absolute value of the complex Jacobian and, hence, (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=242" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 242</a>)
- Example\. Natural generators yr ; yn r of the groups H2r \.CPn /; H2\.n r/ \.CPn / have the intersection number 1\. Indeed, they are realized by projective subspaces CPr ; CPn r of CPn which \(in the general position\) intersect in one point\. Regarding the sign, we will make an important remark\. I (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=242" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 242</a>)

- Moreover, if Y1 ; Y2 are complex \(that is, locally determined by holomorphic equations\) submanifolds of X of complementary dimensions in a general position, then every point in Y1 ; Y2 contributes C1 into the intersection number of the homology classes\. Thus, \.yr ; yn r / D 1, not 1\.

- Notice that in the middle-dimensional homology of an even-dimensional manifold, Theorem 2 has the following, more algebraic restatement\. Theorem 3\. Let X be a connected closed orientable manifold of even dimension 2k, and let Hk0 \.X/ be the free part of Hk \.X/\. Then the integral bilinear form \(the intersection index\) on Hk0 \.X/ is unimodular [that is, the matrix k \.˛i ; ˛j /k where ˛ 1 ; ˛2 ; : : : is a system of generators in Hk0 \.X/ has determinant ˙1]\. This matrix is symmetric if k is even and is skew-symmetric if k is odd\. Since any skew-symmetric matrix of odd order is degenerate, we have the following: Corollary\. The middle Betti number of any closed orientable manifold of dimension 2 mod 4 is even; hence, the Euler characteristic of such a manifold is even\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=244" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 244</a>)
- For nonorientable manifolds neither is true; examples: the first Betti number of the Klein bottle is 1, and the Euler characteristic of the real projective plane is 1\.

- Theorem 3 demonstrates the importance of the theory of integral unimodular \(det D ˙1\) forms in topology of manifolds, especially of dimensions divisible by 4: For an oriented closed manifold of such dimension, there arises a unimodular integral quadratic form as the intersection form in the middle dimension (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=244" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 244</a>)
- For example, the famous Pontryagin theorem states that a homotopy type of a simply connected closed four-dimensional manifold is fully determined by this form\. A lot is known about the classification of such forms \(the best source is Milnor and Husemoller [58]\), but the question of which forms can be intersection forms for smooth closed four-dimensional simply connected manifolds is very far from being resolved\.

- First, we need to assume that all the intersections of the graph and the diagonal are transverse\. This condition may be formulated in the language of calculus\. If x0 is a fixed point of a smooth map f W X ! X, then there arises the differential, dx0 f W Tx0 X ! Tx0 X\. The graph and the diagonal are transverse at x0 if the matrix of dx0 f id is nondegenerate, that is, if fx0 f has no eigenvalues equal to 1\. If this condition holds, then every intersection point acquires some sign, and the intersection number, equal to the Lefschetz number by Theorem 3, is the “algebraic number of fixed points\.” The sign can be described as the parity of the number of real eigenvalues of dx0 f less than 1\.

- A very similar thing can be said about the vector fields\. A nondegenerate zero of a vector field can be assign a sign, and then the algebraic number of zeroes of a vector field must be equal to the Euler characteristic of the manifold\.

- Another extension of the Lefschetz theory may be obtained by admitting, for a manifold considered, a nonempty boundary\. Namely, if X is a compact manifold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=249" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 249</a>)

- he common boundary of the two copies \(see Fig\. 70\)\. Let f W X ! X be a continuous map without fixed points on @X, and let XX be the double of X\. We can extend f to a map ff W XX ! X  XX defining this map on the second half to be the same as on the first half [thus ff \.XX/ is contained in the first half of XX]\. It is obvious that ff has the same fixed points as f and L\.f / D L\.ff /; hence, the statement of the relation of Lefschetz numbers with fixed points holds for compact manifolds with boundary \(orientable or not\)\.

- EXERCISE 27\. There exists a different approach to the Lefschetz theory\. First we prove Theorem 1: The Lefschetz number of a fixed-point–free map is zero\. Then we consider a map f W X ! X with a nondegenerate fixed point, and, at a neighborhood of this point, we modify both X and f in such a way that the fixed point disappears and the Lefschetz number is changed in a controllable way\.

Š As to the homology homomorphism f Š \(called the inverse Hopf homomorphism \), it has a transparent geometric sense which is described, in the smooth case, by the following proposition (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=252" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 252</a>)

- This theorem provides a very powerful tool for determining multiplicative structure in cohomology, mainly for manifolds, but actually for all spaces, because of the naturality of the multiplicative structure\.

- Example\. If q C r  n, then the product of canonical generators of the groups H 2q \.CPn I Z/ and H 2r \.CPn I Z/ is the canonical generator of H 2\.qCr/ \.CPn I Z/; indeed, Poincaré isomorphism takes the three generators into the homology classes of projective subspaces of dimensions n  q; n  r, and n  q  r, and, in general position, intersection of the first two is the third\. Thus, the ring H  \.CPn I Z/ D position, intersection of the first two is the third\. Thus, the ring H n 0 n i H i the n \.CP I Z/ has the following structure: There is 1 2 H 0 n \.CP I Z/ and the L i the 2 n 2q n generator x 2 H \.CP I Z/; the group H \.CP I Z/ with 1  q  n is generated by xq \.

- Theorem 1 shows that the multiplicative structure in cohomology of a closed orientable manifold is rich \(many nonzero products\)\. Actually, we already have a strong statement of this kind: Theorems 2 and 3 of Sect\. 17\.5 show that if X is a compact oriented n-dimensional homology manifold, then for every infinite order class ˛ 2 H m \.XI Z/ there exists a ˇ 2 H n m \.XI Z/ such that h˛ ^ ˇ; ŒXi D 1\. If dim X D 2k and ˛1 ; ˛2 ; : : : is a basis in the free part of H k \.XI Z/, then the matrix kh˛ i ^ ˛j ; ŒXik is unimodular \(that is, its determinant is ˙1\)\.

- Suppose that a connected triangulated space X is an oriented n-dimensional homology manifold which, however, is not assumed to be compact; that is, the triangulation may be not finite\. In this case we still have a correspondence between \(oriented\) simplices and barycentric stars of complementary dimensions, but no isomorphism between chains and cochains, since chains are supposed to be finite linear combinations of simplices \(or barycentric stars\), and cochains are allowed to take nonzero values on infinitely many simplices\. To construct Poincaré isomorphism, we need to modify the definition either of chains or of cochains\.

But if T D @X \(where X is a compact orientable three-dimensional manifold\), then the inclusion homomorphism i  W H1 \.T/ !

- Most problems in homotopy topology consist in a homotopy classification of continuous maps between two topological spaces\. A natural intermediate problem is the question of whether a given continuous map A ! Y can be extended to a continuous map X ! Y for some X  A \(with a subsequent classification of such extensions\)\. This is what the obstruction theory was designed for (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=265" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 265</a>)
- Let X be a CW complex, and let Y be a connected topological space which is assumed homotopically simple \(that is, the action of the fundamental group in all homotopy groups is trivial; later, we will discuss several possibilities of removing or, at least, weakening this condition\)\. Consider the problem of extending a continuous map f W X n ! Y to a continuous map X nC1 ! Y \(where X n ; X nC1 are skeletons\)\. Let e  X be a cell of dimension n C 1, and let hW DnC1 ! X be a corresponding characteristic map\. There arises a continuous map fe D f ı hjSn W Sn ! Y\. It is obvious that f can be continuously extended to X n [ e if and only if fe is homotopic to a constant, that is, if fe represents the class 0 2  (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=265" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 265</a>)

- Furthermore, the possibility of extension of f to X nC1 is the same as the possibility of its extension to every \.n C 1/-dimensional cell of X\. If we construct, as above, a map fe W Sn !

- An algebraically more convenient approach consists in defining a tangent vector of X at x as a linear map vW C 1 \.X/ ! R \(C 1 \.X/ is the space of real C 1 -functions\) such that v\.fg/ D v\.f /g\.x/ C f \.x/v\.g/ \(in other words, tangent vectors are identified with directional derivatives\)\. Finally, if X is presented as a smooth surface in an Euclidean space, then a tangent vector to X is simply a tangent vector to this surface\.

- The set of tangent vectors to an n-dimensional manifold X at a point x is an n-dimensional vector space which is denoted as Tx X\. The union of all spaces Tx X possesses a natural topology and, moreover, a structure of a 2n-dimensional smooth manifold; this manifold is denoted as TX\. The natural projection TX ! X makes TX a total space of a vector bundle over X; this vector bundle is called the tangent bundle of X and is denoted as \.X/\.

- /\. A section of a tangent bundle is a vector field on the manifold\. A manifold whose tangent bundle is trivial is called parallelizable ; a manifold is parallelizable if it is possible to choose bases in all tangent spaces depending continuously of a point or, equivalently, if there exist n D dim X vector fields on X which are linearly independent at every point\.

- For example, the circle is parallelizable, the torus is parallelizable, while the two-dimensional sphere is not parallelizable\. The three-dimensional sphere is parallelizable: If it is presented as the space of unit quaternions, then the basis at the space Tx S3 is formed by quaternions ix; jx; kx where i; j; k are quaternion units\. If you replace quaternions by octonions, 7 you will prove that the sphere S7 is parallelizable (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=286" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 286</a>)
- There is a remarkable fact that no spheres besides S1 ; S3 ; S7 are parallelizable: This is one of the versions of the Frobenius conjecture proven by Adam (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=286" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 286</a>)
- Notice that the problem of parallelization of spheres is equivalent to the problem of existence of spheroids with the invariant Hopf equal to one (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=286" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 286</a>)

- The quotient bundle \.X/jY = \.Y/ is called the normal bundle of Y in X and is denoted as X \.Y/ or \.Y/\. The word “normal” is an indication of the fact that if X is a submanifold of an Euclidean space, then the total space of \.Y/ may be regarded as consisting of vectors at points of Y which are tangent to X and normal to Y\.

- If Y is a submanifold of a manifold X, then there arise two vector bundles with the base Y: \.Y/ and \.X/jY , and \.Y/  \.X/jY \(a tangent vector to a submanifold is also a tangent vector to the manifold (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=287" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 287</a>)
- Notice that the construction of normal bundles with all properties listed can be applied not only to submanifolds, that is, to embeddings of a manifold Y to a manifold X, but also to immersions W Y ! X; the only significant change is that the restriction bundle \.X/jY should be replaced by the induced bundle  \.X/\.

Deduce from the last equality that normal bundles of a manifold corresponding to different embeddings or immersions of this manifold to Euclidean spaces \(possibly, of different dimensions\) are stably equivalent\.

- Deduce from this that the tangent bundle to such a surface \(for example, to an arbitrary sphere with handles\) is stably trivial \(that is, stably equivalent to a trivial bundle\)\. A manifold whose tangent bundle is stably trivial is called stably parallelizable\. Obviously, a manifold is stably parallelizable if and only if its normal bundle is stably trivial\.

- FYI \(this is not an exercise\)\. A closed connected manifold is stably parallelizable if and only if it is parallelizable in the complement to a point\. A noncompact connected manifold if stably parallelizable if and only if it is parallelizable\. A manifold is stably parallelizable if and only if it is orientable and admits an immersion in the Euclidean space of the dimension bigger by 1\.

- The fibers are noncompact spaces which would have better been replaced by homotopy equivalent classical manifolds: Stiefel manifolds and spheres\. This can be done with the help of the following simple lemma\. Lemma\. If a vector bundle has a CW base, then it is possible to introduce in all fibers an Euclidean or Hermitian structure which depends continuously on the point of the base; moreover, this can be done in a homotopically unique way\.

- The set of all Euclidean \(Hermitian\) structures in fibers of a vector bundle is a total space of a fibration whose fiber is the space of all Euclidean \(Hermitian\) structures in a given vector space \( (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=289" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 289</a>)
- Obviously, the fiber of this fibration is contractible \(it is a convex subset of the space of all symmetric bilinear \(Hermitian\) forms in this vector space\. This fibration has a section \(all the obstructions are zeroes\) and this section is homotopically unique \(all difference cochains are zeroes\)\.

- Using these Euclidean or Hermitian structures in the fibers, we can replace the fibration k into the fibration k0 whose total space is the space of all orthonormal \(unitary\) frames in the fibers of \. The fiber of k0 is the Stiefel manifold V\.n; k/ or CV\.n; k/; in particular, 10 is the fibration whose fiber is the sphere Sn 1 \(S2n 1 in the complex case\); this fibration is called spherical\.

If F is a space with a faithful action of G, then, for a finite CW complex X, there is a bijection between the set of equivalence classes of Steenrod bundles over X with the structure group G and the standard fiber F and the set \.X; BG/ of homotopy classes of continuous maps X ! BG\. This construction belongs to J\. Milnor [55]\. It has further generalizations to the cases when G is not a topological group, but an H-space or a topological groupoid (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=295" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 295</a>)

- Some definitions and theorems of the previous sections can be clarified with the help of the classification theorem (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=295" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 295</a>)
- The definition of the sum of vector bundles can be done in the following way: If f W X ! G\.N; n/ and gW X ! G\.M; m/ are two continuous maps, then there arises a map f ˚ gW X ! G\.M C N; m C n/; \.f ˚ g/\.x/ D f \.x/ ˚ g\.x/  RN ˚ RM , and f   ˚ g  D \.f ˚ g/ , which gives an alternative construction of the sum of vector bundles\. The same for tensor products: We consider a map f ˝ gW X ! RNM ; f ˝ g\.x/ D f \.x/ ˝ g\.x/  RN ˝ RM D RNM , and f   ˝ g  D \.f ˝ g/ , which can be regarded as a definition of a tensor product of vector bundles \(same with complex vector bundles\)\. In a similar way, for a vector bundle , we can define S r ; ƒr ;   , etc\.

- Proof of Part \(1\) is immediate\. The restriction of  to RP1 D S1 is the Möbius bundle, and obviously it has no nowhere vanishing section\. Thus,  has no section over the first skeleton, which means that the first obstruction w1 \./ 2 H 1 \.RPn I Z2 / is not zero\.

- It is well known in algebra that every symmetric polynomial in n variables with coefficients in an arbitrary integral domain R has a unique presentation as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomial; the uniqueness statement means that no nonzero polynomial in e1 ; : : : ; en is equal to zero (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=300" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 300</a>)
- But this number is precisely the number of q-dimensional cells in the standard \(Schubert\) CW decomposition of G\.1; n/, which, in turn, does not exceed dimZ2 H q \.G\.1; n/I Z2 /, that is, the dimension of the space of characteristic classes\. Thus, all these numbers and dimensions are the same (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=300" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 300</a>)
- To establish a relation between characteristic classes it is sufficient to check it for splitting bundles, that is, for bundles isomorphic to sums of one-dimensional bundles\.

- We see also that a nonzero characteristic class with coefficients in Z2 of n-dimensional vector bundles takes a nonzero value on the bundle  ˚    ˚ \. This provides a method of finding relations between characteristic classes: A relation holds if it holds for  ˚    ˚ \.

Let X be a topological space \(with a base point\), and let the space X be \.n  1/-connected, that is,  0 \.X/ D 1 \.X/ D : : : D n 1 \.X/ D 0: Then H r \.X/ Š Hr 1 \.X/ for r  2n  2; and a similar isomorphism holds for homology and cohomology with arbitrary coefficients\.

- Theorem\. Let X be an \.n  1/-connected CW complex\. Then the suspension homomorphism †W r \.X/ ! rC1 \.†X/ is an isomorphism if r  2n  2 and is an epimorphism if r D 2n  1\.

- Remark 2\. The last results may serve as one more illustration of the Eckmann–Hilton duality described in Lecture 4\. The operations  and † are dual to each other\. The spaces X and †X have equal \(co\)homology groups \(with a dimension shift by 1\); their homotopy groups are the same in “stable dimensions,” that is, in dimensions less than twice the connectivity of X\. On the other hand, X and X have the same homotopy groups \(again, with a dimension shift\), while their \(co\)homology groups are the same in stable dimensions\.

- Mark one obvious but important property of homomorphisms of spectral sequences: If for some r, the homomorphism Er ! 0Er belonging to a homomorphism between spectral sequences is an isomorphism, then so are all homomorphisms Es ! 0Es with s > r \(including s D 1\)\. Moreover, if two homomorphisms between two spectral sequences coincide on Er for some r, then they coincide on Es for all s > r\.

- Q: Have you ever had the experience where you found a problem to be impossible to solve, and then after putting it aside for some time, an idea suddenly occurred leading to the solution? A: Yes, of course this happens quite often\. For instance, when I was working on homotopy groups \(1950\), I convinced myself that, for a given space X, there should exist a fiber space E, with base X, which is contractible; such a space would indeed allow me \(using Leray’s methods\) to do lots of computations on homotopy groups and Eilenberg–MacLane cohomology\. But how to find it? It took me several weeks \(a very long time, at the age I was then1 \. \. \. \) to realize that the space of “paths” on X had all the necessary properties—if only I dared call it a “fiber space,” which I did\. This was the starting point of the loop space method in algebraic topology; many results followed quickly\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=375" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 375</a>)
- We begin with a quotation from an interview which Jean-Pierre Serre gave in Singapore in February 1985 \(published in Mathematical Intelligencer, 1986, 8, 8–13\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=375" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 375</a>)
- uppose that we want to calculate the homotopy groups of some space X\. Consider the sequence of spaces, X; X; X; X; : : :\. Imagine that there is a way of calculating the homology of the loop space Y, provided that the homology of Y is known\. For this, we can use the spectral sequence of the Y Y path fibration EY ! Y \. But the first nontrivial homology group of k X is, by Hurewicz’s theorem, the same as its first nontrivial homotopy group, say, r \.k X/, which is, in turn, rCk \.X/\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=375" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 375</a>)
- We will not directly use this method here\. We prefer another method, also belonging to Serre: the method of killing spaces\. \(One can say that, roughly speaking, these two Serre’s methods are closely related to each other and lead to similar results\.\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=375" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 375</a>)
- If n \.X/ D  is the first nontrivial homotopy group of X, then XjnC1 is related to X by two fibrations: Xj nC1 K\.;n 1/ XjnC1 X ! K\.; n/; K\.;n 1/ XjnC1 ! X: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=376" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 376</a>)
- The first of them was constructed in Sect\. 11\.9: Its projection belongs to the homotopy class of maps corresponding to the fundamental class FX 2 H n \.XI /\. The projection of the second fibration is homotopic to the inclusion XjnC1 ! X of the fiber of the first fibration; in other words, it is the fibration over X induced by K\.;n 1/ K\.;n 1/ the path fibration EK\.; n/ !K\.; n/ with respect to the projection of the first fibration\. In still other words, both fibrations may be described as parts of the following commutative diagram of four fibrations: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=376" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 376</a>)
- We usually will use the second of these fibrations\. In principle, if we know the cohomology of K\.; n  1/, then we can at least try to find the cohomology of Xj nC1 , and hence the first nontrivial homotopy group of XjnC1 , which is the second nontrivial homotopy group of X\. And so on\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=376" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 376</a>)

- and hence 4 \.S3 j4 / D Z2 \) 4 \.S3 / D Z2 \) nC1 \.Sn / D Z2 for n  3\. The reader who was able to get through the exercises in Sect\. 10\.5 already knows this fact\. But even for that reader the easiness of the proof may be strong evidence of a big advantage of the method of spectral sequences\. At the same time, we can see a great importance of the “Eilenberg–MacLane cohomology” H  \.K\.; n/I / (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=377" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 377</a>)
- The computation of the Eilenberg–MacLane cohomology turned out to be hard work\. Still, the problem was fully solved \(for finitely generated Abelian \) in the 1950s, mostly by the French topologists A\. Borel, H\. Cartan, and J\.-P\. Serre\. The easiest part of this work was the computation of the rational cohomology ring H  \.K\.; n/I Q/\. T (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=378" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 378</a>)
- Theorem\. If  is a finitely generated \(finite\) Abelian group, then for every finitely generated Abelian group G and every n > 0 and q > 0, the group H q \.K\.; n/I G/ is finitely generated \(finite\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=378" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 378</a>)
- For n D 1, the statement is true: We know the spaces K\.Z; 1/ D S1 ; K\.Z2 ; 1/ D RP 1 ; K\.Zm ; 1/ D L1 m \(the infinite-dimensional lens space\) for m > 2 and their cohomology: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=378" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 378</a>)
- We say that a class C of Abelian groups is given if every Abelian group belongs or does not belong to C, and \(1\) isomorphic groups belong or do not belong to C simultaneously; \(2\) if a group belongs to C, then all its subgroups and all its quotients belong to C; \(3\) if a subgroup H of a group G and the quotient G=H belong to C, then G belongs to C\.

- Theorem\. Let X be a simply connected topological space such that all homology groups Hq \.X/; q > 0 are finitely generated \(finite\)\. Then all the homotopy groups q \.X/ are finitely generated \(finite\)\.

- Remark\. The requirement of X being simply connected is not unnecessary: For example, the homology groups of S1 \_ S2 are all finitely generated, while the group  2 \.S1 \_ S2 / is not finitely generated (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=380" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 380</a>)
- F EXERCISE 2\. Let E ! B be a homologically simple fibration\. Prove that if the homology groups of positive dimensions of two of the three spaces E; B; and F are finitely generated \(finite\), then the same is true for the homology groups of the third space\.

- Corollary\. The homotopy groups m \.S3 / are finite for all m  4\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=380" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 380</a>)
- Proof\. It was shown in Sect\. 25\.2 that all the groups Hm \.S3 j4 /; m > 0, are finite\. Hence, by the theorem, the groups m \.S3 j4 / are all finite, and m \.S3 j4 / D m \.S3 / for all m  4\.

- EXERCISE 3\. Prove that if all homology groups of some positive dimension of a simply connected \(or homotopically simple\) space belong to a class C of finitely generated Abelian groups, then all the homotopy groups of this space also belong to the class C\.

- EXERCISE 4\. Prove the following “Hurewicz C-theorem”: If for some simply connected space X, all homotopy groups m \.X/ with m < n belong to a class C \(as in Exercise 3\), then the groups Hm \.X/ with m < n also belong to C and the Hurewicz homomorphism n \.X/ ! Hn \.X/ is a C-isomorphism \(that is, its kernel and cokernel belong to C\)\. Prove also the inverse statement where homology and homotopy groups are swapped\.

- Remark\. It follows from the Hurewicz C-theorem that for every prime p the order of the group m \.S3 / with 4  m < 2p is not divisible by p (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=382" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 382</a>)

- In other words, for a simply connected space X with a free skew-commutative rational cohomology algebra, there is a dimension-preserving bijection between free additive generators of homotopy groups and free multiplicative generators of a rational cohomology algebra\.

- We have already noticed that the theorem on the ranks of homotopy groups of an odd-dimensional sphere is a corollary of the Cartan–Serre theorem\. However, the case of an even-dimensional sphere is not covered by Cartan–Serre, since the cohomology ring of an even-dimensional sphere has an undesirable relation: The square of an even-dimensional generator is equal to 0 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=388" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 388</a>)
- A reader may create an impression that as soon as we know the rational cohomology ring of, say, a simply connected CW complex, we can find the ranks of its homotopy groups\.

- A question arises: Is it possible to express in terms of rational cohomology information about a \(say, simply connected, CW\) space sufficient for determining the ranks of homotopy groups? The answer is yes; however, for this purpose, we need to consider, in addition to the classical cohomological multiplication, a sequence of “higher multiplications,” the Massey products \( (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=389" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 389</a>)

- It is possible to extend this construction to still “higher” Massey products\. For example, for a quadruple of cohomology classes ˛; ˇ; ; ı such that ˛ˇD0; ˇ D0; ı D 0; h˛; ˇ; i 3 0; hˇ; ; ıi 3 0, one can construct a cohomology class h˛; ˇ; ; ıi with a still bigger indeterminacy than triple Massey product (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=389" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 389</a>)
- A general algebraic description of Massey products is contained in the article by Fuchs and Weldon [41]\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=389" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 389</a>)
- It turns out that the rational cohomology of a simply connected space, given with the multiplicative structure and the whole infinite sequence of Massey products, determines the ranks of homotopy groups \(with Whitehead products and a sequence of Whitehead–Massey products in homotopy groups tensored with Q\)\.

- A different approach \(related to, but not based on Massey products\) to rational homotopy types was developed by Dennis Sullivan as the minimal model theory\. The main ingredient of this theory consists in assigning to a space a rational cochain complex furnished with an associative skew-commutative multiplication whose cohomology is the rational cohomology of the space \(in Sullivan’s original construction it is the complex of piecewise rational differential forms\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=389" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 389</a>)

- For formal spaces, a rational cohomology algebra determines ranks of homotopy groups \(by a procedure similar to that of this lecture\)\. Examples of formal spaces include loop spaces, spheres \(both oddand even-dimensional\), Kähler manifolds, and symmetric spaces\.

- We cannot say more, since we do not know the action of the differential labeled by the question mark\.

- The construction of this bijection uses a remarkable cohomology class F 2 H n \.K\.; n/I /, which has several equivalent definitions; for example, the universal coefficients formula isomorphism H n \.K\.; n/I / D Hom\.Hn \.K\.; n//; / D Hom\.; / connects F  with id \. Namely, for an ˛ 2 H n \.XI /, there exists a homotopically unique continuous map h˛ W X ! K\.; n/ such that h ˛ \.F / D ˛\. Our bijection is ˛ $ Œh˛ \.

A nonzero cohomology operation does not lower the dimension [that is, if 0 ¤ ' 2 O\.n; q; ; G/, then q  n\.] (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=400" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 400</a>)
- Here is an example of a cohomology operation which is not a homomorphism\. Let  be a ring, and let n be an even number\. The raising to a square H n \.XI / ! H 2n \.XI / is a cohomology operation which, in general, is not a homomorphism \(it certainly is a homomorphism if  D Z2 \)\.

- In particular, if  is finite, then H  \.K\.; n/I Q/ D 0, so there are no nontrivial cohomology operations from cohomology with finite coefficients into rational cohomology\.

- \. If n is odd, then H  \.K\.Z; n/I Q/ D H  \.Sn I Q/, so every nontrivial cohomology operation from odd-dimensional integral cohomology into rational cohomology preserves dimension and is a fixed rational number times the homomorphism induced by the inclusion Z ! Q\. If n is even, there also appear operations assigning to an integral cohomology class its powers \(rationalized\)\.

- The space K\.Zp ; n/ has precisely one \.n C 1/-dimensional cell \(obtained by attaching DnC1 to Sn by a spheroid Sn ! Sn of degree p\)\. Thus, H nC1 \.K\.Zp ; n/I Zp / is, at most, Zp , so there is, up to a multiplication by a constant, at most one cohomology operation of the type \.n; nC1; Zp ; Zp /\. But we know such an operation: the Bockstein homomorphism \(see Sect\. 15\.3\)\.

- If G is a field, then the ring of stable cohomology operations becomes an algebra\. If G D Zp , then this algebra is called the Steenrod algebra and is denoted as Ap (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=405" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 405</a>)
- 29\.1 An Introduction We begin with a construction of some important elements of the Steenrod algebra A 2 which are called Steenrod squares\. Steenrod squares Sqi are stable cohomology operations which are additive homomorphisms Sq i W H n \.XI Z2 / ! H nCi \.XI Z2 /: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=405" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 405</a>)
- They are defined for all i  0 and possess the following properties \(in addition to the properties required by the definition of stable cohomology operations\): \(1\) 8 Sq 8 < 0; if i > dim ˛; i ˛ D ˛ 2 ; if i D dim ˛; < ˛; if i D 0: (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=405" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 405</a>)

- Add to this that since Sq1 is not zero \(Sq1 ˛ D ˛ 2 for dim ˛ D 1\), it must be the Bockstein homomorphism \(see Sect\. 28\.3\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=407" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 407</a>)

- To finish the proof, notice that for any space X, the diagonal map W †X ! †X †X is homotopic to a map taking †X into †X \_†X: The homotopy ht W †X ! †X  †X is defined by the formula ht \.x/ D \.'t \.x/; t \.x//, where 't ; t W †X ! †X are two homotopies of the identity map \.'0 D 0 D id†X / such that '1 \.C1 X/ D x 0 ; 1 \.C2 X/ D x0 , where C1 X; C2 X are two cones composing †X and x0 2 †X is an \(arbitrarily chosen\) base point (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=408" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 408</a>)
- On the other hand, the cross-product of any two cohomology classes of X of positive dimensions has zero restriction to †X \_ †X \(at least in the case when X is a CW complex\)\. Hence, in the cohomology of †X, the cup-product of any two classes of positive dimensions is zero\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=408" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 408</a>)
- The Steenrod algebra A D A2 is the algebra of all stable cohomology operations over the field Z2 where the multiplication is defined as the composition\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=411" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 411</a>)
- It turns out that the algebra A is multiplicatively generated by Steenrod squares Sq i ; that is, every stable cohomology operation in Z2 -cohomology is a linear combination of iterations of Steenrod squares\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=411" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 411</a>)
- However, the Steenrod squares do not form a free system of multiplicative generators: There are relations between them\. In particular, an additive basis of the algebra A is not formed by all iterations of Steenrod squares, but only by iterations Sq I D Sqi1 Sqi2 : : : Sqik for which the sequence I D fi1 ; i2 ; : : : ; ik g satisfies the conditions i 1  2i2 ; i2  2i3 ; : : : ; ik 1  2ik (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=411" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 411</a>)
- \(such sequences are usually called admissible sequences, and the corresponding iterations of Steenrod squares are called admissible iterations \)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=411" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 411</a>)
- The multiplicative structure of A is determined by the so-called Adem relations \(see Adem [11]\): If a < 2b, then a b !

- Theorem\. H  \.K\.Z2 ; n/I Z2 / is a polynomial algebra with the generators SqI en for all admissible sequences I D fi1 ; : : : ; ik g with exc I < n\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=412" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 412</a>)
- Theorem\. The Steenrod algebra A2 is additively generated by admissible iterations Sq I \(without restrictions on excesses\)\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=416" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 416</a>)
- Thus, all stable cohomology operations in the cohomology with coefficients in Z2 are sums of iterations of Steenrod squares (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=416" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 416</a>)
- \. Moreover, we see that there must exist many relations between these iterations, since an arbitrary iteration is equal to a sum of admissible iterations\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=416" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 416</a>)
- Suppose that we are given a certain \(noncommutative\) polynomial in Steenrod squares, P\.Sq 1 ; Sq2 ; : : : /\. How can we prove that it is equal to zero? Theoretically, we need to prove the equality P\.Sq 1 ; Sq2 ; : : : /x D 0 for every cohomology class x 2 H n \.XI Z2 / of every, say, CW complex X\. Visibly, there arise two difficulties, and each of them seems to be a dead end\. First, how do we observe all cohomology classes of all CW complexes? Second, even for an individual x, how do we compute Sq I x for an iteration SqI of Steenrod squares? (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=417" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 417</a>)
- The second difficulty does not exist in the case when x is a product of onedimensional cohomology classes: Then SqI x can easily be found with Cartan’s formula\. And it turns out that we actually do not need anything else\. Here is an explanation\.

- FYI\.

- In the early 1930s, H\. Hopf gave a homotopy classification of continuous maps of an n-dimensional CW complex X into the ndimensional sphere\. It turned out that these homotopy classes bijectively correspond to cohomology classes in H n \.XI Z/1 \(see Sect\. 18\.4\); namely, the homotopy class of a map f W X ! Sn is bijectively characterized by the cohomology class f  \.s/ 2 H n \.XI Z/, where s 2 H n \.Sn I Z/ is the canonical generator\.

- But one should not think that the goal of the groundbreaking work of Steenrod was studying any cohomology operations\. The work \(Steenrod [81]\) was devoted to an old homotopy problem\. In the early 1930s, H\. Hopf gave a homotopy classification of continuous maps o (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=434" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 434</a>)
- Remark 1\. According to Steenrod’s construction, the reason for the existence of Steenrod squares lies in the noncommutativity of multiplication of cellular \(or classical\) cochains (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=435" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 435</a>)

- 31\.4 Nonexistence of Spheroids with an Odd Hopf Invariant Theorem\. If n is not a power of 2, the group 2n 1 \.Sn / does not contain elements whose Hopf invariant is odd\. \(See Remark 5 in Sect\. 16\.5\.\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=435" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 435</a>)
- Remark\. This theorem was proved by Hopf in the 1930s\. However, the proof was complicated and did not seem convincing to topologists of that time; even some \(false!\) counterexamples to it were published by some prominent mathematician (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=435" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 435</a>)
- Proof of Theorem\. Let ˛ 2 2n 1 \.Sn / be an element with an odd Hopf invariant, and let Y D Sn [f D2n , where f W S2n 1 ! Sn is a spheroid of the class ˛\. Then  q Z2 ; if q D 0; n; 2n; q H \.YI Z2 / D 0 for all other q; and, by definition of the Hopf invariant, the squaring operation H n \.YI Z2 / ! H 2n \.YI Z2 / is nontrivial\. But this operation is the same as Sqn , and if n is not a power of 2, then Sqn may be presented as a polynomial of Sqi with 0 < i < n \(see Exercise 2 in Sect\. 30\.5\)\. But since H q \.YI Z2 / D 0 for n < q < 2n, any such polynomial is zero on H n \.YI Z2 /\. This contradiction proves the theorem\.

- \. One of the possible proofs of this fact consists in a construction, which shows that the operations Sq 16 ; Sq32 ; : : : , indecomposable within the class of usual \(“primary”\) cohomology operations, are decomposable within the class of \(“secondary”\) cohomology operation\.

- The lens space has a natural cell decomposition which is obtained from the following Zp -invariant cell decomposition of S3 with p cells in every dimension 0; 1; 2; 3\. The circle S 1 D f\.z; 0/ j jzj D 1g  S3 is divided by the p 2ki points e0k D \.e p ; 0/; k D 0; 1; : : : ; p  1, into the union of p arcs; we denote the \(open\) arc joining e0k with e0kC1 \(throughout this section, we regard subscripts as 0k with e0kC1 2ki residues modulo p\) as e1k \. Next, we put e2k D f\.z1 ; z2 / 2 S3 j z2 2 R>0  e p g and take for e3k the domain between e2k and e2kC1 \. We get the desired cell decomposition of S3 \. \(Some people say that this decomposition reminds them of an orange; if the reader finds this comparison helpful, we appreciate it\.\) The transformation T maps the cells e0k ; e1k ; e2k ; e3k homeomorphically onto e0kC1 ; e1kC1 ; e2kCq ; e3kCq \. Thus, our cell decomposition of S3 gives rise to a cell decomposition of L\.p; q/, with one cell in every dimension, e0 ; e1 ; e2 ; e3 \. All the cells in S3 have natural orientations preserved by T; thus, the cells in L\.p; q/ are also naturally oriented\.

Moreover, elementary number theory states that if p is prime and p  3 mod 4, then every q not divisible by p is congruent either to a square or to a negative square \(for example, 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6  12 ; 32 ; 22 ; 22 ; 33 ; 12 mod 7\), (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=438" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 438</a>)
- Homotopy equivalent lens spaces are not necessarily homeomorphic\. For example, the lens spaces L\.7; 1/; L\.7; 2/ are homotopy equivalent, but not homeomorphic\. This fact can be established with the help of the so-called Reidemeister–Franz torsion\. The reader can find details in the book by Dubrovin, Fomenko, and Novikov [35] \(Sect\. 11 of Chap\. 1, Problems 5–8\), or in the book by de Rham, Maumary, and Kervaire [34]\.

- If we know the cohomology of the space X, we can find, relatively easily, the “stable part” of the cohomology of the first killing space of X, and then the same for the second, the third, and so on killing spaces (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=439" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 439</a>)
- s\. Hurewicz’s theorem gives us, every time, the corresponding homotopy group\. This method \(the Serre method\) does not permit us, however, to find the homotopy groups without dealing with other difficulties\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=439" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 439</a>)
- As we demonstrated in the previous lecture, the information about the action of stable cohomology operations may be used for computing stable homotopy groups\.

- n the upper row, there is the cohomology K\.Z2 ; N  1/ modulo 2, which coincides, in the stable dimensions, with the Steenrod algebra A2 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=441" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 441</a>)
- Thus, the cohomology of XjN is fully known to us, but the action of the cohomology operations in this cohomology is known to us only partially (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=441" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 441</a>)
- Thus, we have no full information on the action of cohomology operations in the cohomology of XjN , and hence we cannot find the cohomology of the next killing space\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=441" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 441</a>)
- The modern topology has no way to overcome this difficulty; the homotopy groups of spheres have not been calculated yet\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=441" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 441</a>)
- t\. But there is a possibility to “expose the difficulty in a pure form,” namely, to collect all the computations related to stable homotopy groups into one spectral sequence\. The initial term of this spectral sequence will be known, and all the difficulties will be concentrated in the computations of the differential\. This is what the Adams spectral sequence is\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=441" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 441</a>)
- Certainly, the role of the Adams spectral sequence is not restricted to exposing difficulties: It also allows us to resolve part of them\. Namely, the Adams spectral sequence may be furnished with an amount of additional structures \(for example, the multiplicative structure\) which do not show themselves at the level of usual killing spaces and which provide rich information on the action of the differentials\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=442" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 442</a>)
- The Serre method of computing homotopy groups consists in killing the cohomology groups ordered by their dimension: First, we kill the nth group, then pass to the \.nC1/st, and so on\. The Adams method also consists in killing cohomology groups, but in a different order\. Take a space X\. For example, let it be \.N 1/-connected, and we want to find the p-components of its homotopy groups from the dimension N to the dimension N C n\. At the first step we kill all the cohomology of X modulo p in these dimensions\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=442" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 442</a>)

- N C qi /\. There arises a fibration The spectral sequence of this fibration looks as follows\. In the upper row, there is a “free Ap -module”; that is, the action of cohomology operations in this row, at least in the dimensions not very much exceeding N, is free: There are no relations which do not follow from the relations in the Steenrod algebra Ap itself\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=442" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 442</a>)

- There arises a sequence of Adams killing spaces, X\.1/; X\.2/; X\.3/; : : :, with a chain of fibrations : : : X\.3/ ! X\.2/ ! X\.1/ ! X whose fibers are products of K\.Zp ; n/s\.

- Notice that the killing of all elements of Zp -cohomology of X, as well as all subsequent killing, may be made in a more economical way\. For example, if we kill the element  and, say, Pip  ¤ 0, we do not need to kill Pip  separately: It will be killed automatically simultaneously with \. Speaking more algebraically, we should not kill all elements of some basis of the vector space over Zp , but rather all elements of some system of generators of an Ap -module (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=443" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 443</a>)

[It is easy to understand: F 0 is a free module whose free generators bijectively correspond to the chosen generators of the module H  \.XI Zp /\.] The kernel of this epimorphism is again an Ap -module, but not necessarily free\. We construct a free Ap -module F1 and an Ap -epimorphism of it onto our kernel, in other words, an Ap -homomorphism F1 ! F0 whose image is the kernel of the epimorphism F0 ! H  \.XI Zp /\. Repeating this construction, we get an exact sequence : : : ! F3 ! F2 ! F1 ! F0 ! H  \.XI Zp / ! 0 of Ap -modules and Ap -homomorphisms in which all the modules Fi are free\. Such a sequence is called a free resolution of the module H  \.XI Zp /\.

- Let us return to geometry\. Our process is, in some sense, converging; that is, the cohomology of the spaces X\.k/ becomes less and less and, again in some sense, completely vanishes at the limit\. However, the Serre killing process was directly related \(via Hurewicz’s theorem\) to the homotopy groups of the space\. Namely, we always killed the cohomology of the smallest dimension, and every killing corresponded to some element of the homotopy group\. It is not so, however, for the Adams killing\.

- The decomposition G D compp G ˚ compp G \(see Sect\. 34\.6\) in the case when G is finitely generated, but not necessarily finite, should be replaced by the decomposition G D Compp G ˚ compp G, where compp G is the same as before, the subgroup of G consisting of 0 and all elements of finite order prime to p, and Compp G Š \.G= comp p G/\.

- The multiplicative structure in the cohomological Leray spectral sequence appeared because the cohomology groups of which this spectral sequence is made possess a multiplicative structure\. The groups of which the Adams spectral sequence is made are homotopy groups which do not possess any multiplicative structure\. Well, there certainly is the Whitehead product, but it is useless for the Adams spectral sequence since it is zero in the stable dimensions (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=473" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 473</a>)

- L An associative unitary graded algebra A D m Am over a field K is called a Hopf algebra if the following axioms hold\. \(1\) \(2\) \(3\) \(4\) A m D 0 for negative m, and A0 D K\. There is defined a diagonal map or comultiplication W A !

- Example 1\. Cohomology \(as well as homology\) of an H-space X with coefficients in a field is a Hopf algebra: The multiplication and comultiplication are induced by the diagonal map X !

- If A is a Hopf algebra and B; C are A-modules, then the tensor product B ˝K C also has a natural structure of an A-module\. Indeed, B ˝K C is naturally an \.A ˝K A/module, and the algebra homomorphism W A ! A ˝K A turns it into an A-module\.

- We begin with a computation of the E2 -term of the Adams spectral sequence for the case of 2-components of stable homotopy groups of spheres, that is, the cohomology of the Steenrod algebra mod 2\.

- But even without this, we see now that the orders of the 2-components of the stable groups nCk \.Sn / with k D 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7 are 2, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 16 or 8 (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=488" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 488</a>)
- We see that the problem of the computation of the stable homotopy groups of spheres falls into two parts: the computation of the cohomology of the Steenrod algebra and the computation of the differentials of the Adams spectral sequence\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=491" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 491</a>)
- The first part is reduced to a purely mechanical work \(or to a computer program\) and can be done up to any degree\. In the book Stable Homotopy Theory of Adams \(see Adams [2]\) the result of this computation is presented for t  s  17\.

- In addition to all this, we remark that the computation of 2-components of 14th and further stable homotopy groups of spheres encounters a difficulty: The grading arguments no longer guarantee the triviality of differentials (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=493" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 493</a>)
- Within our dimension range, the only necessity for considering the Adams spectral sequence arises for p D 3\. Indeed, we already know \(see Sect\. 27\.4\) that the first S p-component in the stable homotopy groups of spheres is Zp  2p 3 0 p 3 \.S / and the S second is Zp  4p 5 0 p 5 \.S /; thus, besides S Z5  7 0 \.S / and S Z7  11 \.S 0 /, the groups  S n \.S 0 / with n  13 do not have p-components with p > 3\.

- Here each group Exts;t which occurs in the E2 -term can be effectively computed; the process is purely algebraic\. However, no such effective method is given for computing the differentials dr in the spectral sequence or to determine the group extension by which p S \.X; Y/ is built up from the E1 -term; these are topological problems\.

- In fact, when a chance has arisen to show that such a differential d r is nonzero, it has been regarded as an interesting problem, and duly solved\.

- As we can see from this quotation from Adams’ article \(Adams [8]\), its author did not think that the existence of the algorithm for computing the cohomology is equivalent to its computing (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=496" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 496</a>)
- existence of the algorithm for computing the cohomology is equivalent to its computing\. Adams devoted several works to this subject\. Here we will formulate his most important results\.

- We conclude this lecture with an example of an Adams spectral sequence with a nontrivial differential\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=497" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 497</a>)

- Thus, we have constructed a secondary operation '\. It is a family of partial multivalued homomorphisms H N \.XI Zp / Ü H NCn 1 \.XI Zp / \(partial because they are defined only on the intersection of the kernels of the operations ˛i ; multivalued because they are defined modulo the images of the operations ˇi \)\.

- The best-known example of a secondary cohomology operation is the so-called second Bockstein homomorphism\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=500" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 500</a>)

- If one does not restrict this theory to stable operations, and considers arbitrary coefficient groups, then it becomes true that the cohomology with the action of all this higher cohomology operations fully determines the homotopy type of a simply connected space\.

- On the other hand, elements of the stable homotopy groups of spheres arise from the Adams spectral sequence\. What is the relation between \(primary and higher\) cohomology operations and stable homotopy groups of spheres?

- We already know that the homotopy groups of a space \(even of a CW complex\) do not fully determine its homotopy type\. There are two exceptions: when all the homotopy groups are trivial, and when there is only one nontrivial homotopy group\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=502" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 502</a>)
- Suppose that a CW complex X has trivial homotopy groups of all dimensions except n1 and n2 , and n1 \.X/ D …1 ; n2 \.X/ D …2 \. Then there (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=502" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 502</a>)
- This shows that a space of the form S N [DNCq with a nontrivial action of Sqq exists only for q D 1; 2; 4; 8\. We explained in Sect\. 31\.4 that this is equivalent to the fact that a group 4n 1 \.S 2 n/ contains an element with odd Hopf invariant only for n D 1; 2, and 4\. Let us mention a more classical \(and actually equivalent\) approach to the problem of the odd Hopf invariant \(known as the Frobenius conjecture\) (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=502" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 502</a>)

- These cohomology operations are called Postnikov factors\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=503" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 503</a>)
- arises a \(homotopically unique\) map X ! K\.…1 ; n1 / which may be considered a fibration, and the fiber is K\.…2 ; n2 /\. In the cohomology spectral sequence of this fibration with coefficients in …2 , the fundamental class u2 2 H n2 \.K\.…2 ; n2 /I …2 / D 20;n 2 E 20;n2 is transgressive and is taken by the transgression into some element f1 of E 2n2 C1;0 D H n2 C1 \.K\.…1 ; n1 /I …2 /\. This f1 , on one hand, fully determines the fibration, and hence \(the homotopy type of\) X, and on the other hand it can be regarded as a \(primary\) cohomology operation H n1 \.I …1 / ! H n2 C1 \.I …2 /\. Thus, the homotopy type of a space X with two nontrivial homotopy groups is determined by these groups plus one primary cohomology operation, which is called the \(first\) Postnikov factor of X\.

- Thus, according to the Postnikov theory, the homotopy type of a simply connected CW complex is determined by the homotopy groups plus a sequence of cohomology operations, a primary one, a secondary one, and so on, such that every operation from this sequence in defined on the kernel of the previous one\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=504" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 504</a>)

- K-theory emerged as an independent part of topology in the late 1950s, when the limits of the possibilities of the methods based on spectral sequences and cohomology operations \(and studied in Chaps\. III–V\) became visible (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=505" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 505</a>)
- It consisted of replacing cohomology as the basic homotopy invariant by an entirely new object, the so-called K-functor\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=505" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 505</a>)
- The first works in K-theory were published in 1959, and as early as 1963 most of its results were completed \(including all the results described below, with the exception of the proof of the Adams conjecture\)\. And it is remarkable that all works in K-theory of this period belong to four authors: Frank Adams, Michael Atiyah, Raoul Bott, and Friedrich Hirzebruch\. There is no name of Alexander Grothendieck on this list, for he has no works in topology; but according to common opinion, it was Grothendieck who had first conceived of the key ideas of K-theory that found their applications not only in topology\. The topological applications of K-theory obtained during its “heroic period” were really impressive\. Let us mention only a simple proof of the nonexistence of division algebras in dimensions different from 1, 2, 4, 8; the precise computation of the maximal number of linearly independent vector fields on the sphere of an arbitrary dimension; the computation of the order of the image of the “J-homomorphism” n \.SO/ ! nS ; theorems of nonembeddability and nonimmersibility of various manifolds into Euclidean spaces; as well as various (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=505" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 505</a>)

- integrality theorems for rational linear combinations of characteristic classes\. The solution of the problem of the index of an elliptic operator found in 1963 by Atiyah and Singer would have been totally impossible without K-theory\. (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=506" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 506</a>)
- for the usual cohomology \(for example, with the coefficients in Z\) the following Whitehead theorem holds: If X and Y are simply connected CW complexes, and if a continuous map f W X ! Y induces an isomorphism f  W H  \.YI Z/ ! H  \.XI Z/, then f is a homotopy equivalence \(see Sect\. 14\.5\)\. K-theory also assigns to a \(finite\) CW complex a graded group that depends on it in a functorial way, but there is no analog of Whitehead’s theorem: It is quite possible that f  W K  \.Y/ ! K  \.X/ is an isomorphism, but f is not a homotopy equivalence\. Some extraordinary theories were conceived \(or, better to say, recollected\) that have all the advantages of K-theory and are free of this flaw\. The best known of these theories is the cobordism theory, which exists in a variety of versions \(the same is true for K-theory, by the way\)\. For cobordisms, the analog of Whitehead’s theorem is valid; thus, from the point of view of homotopy theory, cobordism theory is not worse than cohomology\. The topologists were able to construct for cobordisms an analog of the Adams spectral sequence, the so-called Adams–Novikov spectral sequence, which was repeatedly applied to homotopy calculations\. A theory of cobordism-valued characteristic classes proved to be very (<a href="file:////home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Anatoly Fomenko/Homotopical Topology (707)/Homotopical Topology - Anatoly Fomenko.pdf#page=506" target="_blank">Anatoly Fomenko 506</a>)
- useful\. At last the assertion that cobordisms are better than K-theories had a precise statement: The \(complex\) K-theory may be embedded into the \(complex\) cobordism theory as a direct summand\. We pay a tribute to cobordism theories by devoting a separate lecture to them \(Lecture 44\)\.

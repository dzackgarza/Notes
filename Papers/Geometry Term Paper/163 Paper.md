# Preface

The primary purpose of this paper is to discuss Alexandre Grothendieck, who is often cited as one of the most influential mathematical thinkers of the 20th century. In order to fully appreciate the impact of his contributions, it is necessary to provide some historical context in which to place his work, and to this end, this paper will also discuss the history, content, and some of the key figures in the field of Algebraic Geometry.

This topic was chosen in part because of the significance of Grothendieck's accomplishments and the legacy he has left on modern mathematical theory, but also because it allows place the field of Geometry in a wider context, with a narrative that spans from the time of the Greeks to the proof of the infamous last theorem of Fermat near the turn of the 20th century. In particular, the interplay between Algebra and Geometry has a rich and storied history, including a unification between the two fields that has advanced rapidly in the past two to three hundred years.

Treating this subject cohesively will require not only examining the historical context, however -- in order to fully appreciate the impact of some of the more modern results, it will be necessary to cover some of the mathematical content as well. To this end, this paper does not seek to provide a rigorous treatment of Algebraic Geometry - many references are provided in the reference section that serve this purpose quite nicely.

Instead, such mathematical inclusions are meant to inform the historical narrative, and so attention will be restricted to only those definitions that provide a common and unifying language in which to frame the results that are mentioned. It is often touted that the field of Algebraic Geometry is somewhat obtuse, and rife with "heavy mathematical machinery" -- it is for this reason that a secondary goal of this paper is to help demystify the subject, and perhaps provide some motivations for why such mathematical machinery would be invented, and why it has earned its place as a rich and distinguished field of mathematical inquiry.

Ultimately, the goal of this paper is to understand and discuss Grothendieck's pioneering use of _schemes_, a construct introduced in his well-known 1957 'Tohoku' paper, which helped lay a new framework for Algebraic Geometry and has driven advances in field ever since. In order to understand the significance of schemes, however, one must first understand _sheaves_, the construct that schemes are meant to generalize and extend. Sheaves in turn are in many ways defined analogously to _manifolds_, which are often thought of as spaces that locally resemble standard Euclidean space, and it is from this construct that a great deal of geometric intuition can be derived and used to guide powerful algebraic generalizations.

# Algebraic Geometry: A Historical Perspective

## The Greeks

Algebraic Geometry is among the oldest branch of mathematics, which was studied as early as 400 BCE by the Greeks in the form of conic sections. For the Greeks, in fact, the division between Algebra and Geometry was perhaps indistinguishable. Without the benefits of a numeral system amenable to calculations, nor convenient symbolic shorthands used in modern mathematics, the very problems they studied were inextricably tied to the geometric situations from which they were born.

Because the Greeks worked not primarily with individual number, but instead _magnitudes_: lengths, areas, volumes, and ratios thereof. Because of this, algebraic identities such as $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ would have been expressed in terms of relationships between geometric figures -- in this case, perhaps as certain arrangements and rearrangements of squares and rectangles as shown in the figure below.

Of primary interest to the Greeks was the solution of algebraic equations by means of examining the intersection of algebraic curves. In this way, they were led to study the _conic sections_, those curves which can be obtained by intersecting a plane with the surface of a cone. In modern parlance, one might refer to such sections as those traced out by real numbers $x$ and $y$  that satisfy a relationship of the form $Ax^2 +By^2 + Cxy + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, where the coefficients $A$ through $F$ are also taken to be real. Despite not quite having the algebraic notation to state the problem in this form nor the benefit of modern analytic and algebraic tools, the Greeks were able to characterize all such sections, yielding circles, ellipses, hyperbolas, parabolas, straight lines, and the degenerate case of a single point.

Accordingly, the Greeks were aware of methods (for example) to solve problems such as "squaring a rectangle", to which one might associate equations of the form $x^2 = ab$, regarding the quantity $x^2$ as the area of a unknown square and both $a$ and $b$ as known side lengths. In their mathematical framework, all such "constructions" were necessarily geometric in nature, and were thus restricted to those which could be obtained with use of a compass and straightedge. In these terms, such a problem might be cast as finding the solutions $x$ that satisfy the cross-ratio $\frac{x}{b} = \frac{a}{x}$ instead. A similar example is the problem of "doubling the cube" - that is, given a cube with known side lengths, constructing a second cube with exactly twice the volume of the first. This amounts to finding $x$ that satisfy a similar ratio $\frac{x^3}{a^3} = \frac{b}{a}$ instead. Considering the simplest case of the unit cube led to questions concerning whether number such as $\sqrt[3]{2}$ were constructible in the geometric sense described above, a question that would remain unsolved until the advent of the algebraic tools of Galois Theory in the 19th century

However, although in many cases the Greeks made use of coordinates, their study of geometry did not have the same analytic flavor that it takes on today - the modern notion of a coordinate system would not enter the mathematical zeitgeist until nearly the 17th century, with the work of Rene Descartes. Moreover, the classical study was restricted to algebraic curves in at most 3 dimensions, and usually over fields such as $\RR$ or $\QQ$, and so it remained until the "Geometric Renaissance" of the 18th and 19th centuries.

## Modern Times

Due to reverence of the infamous fifth postulate of Euclid, the study of _synthetic geometry_ - that built on a collection axiomatic foundations - remained the dominant mode of Geometric thought. With the advent of Cartesian coordinates, however, a separate study of _analytic_ or coordinate geometry began, coinciding with the beginning of the study of alternative geometries based upon negating the fifth postulate. However, the unreasonable effectiveness of coordinates in applications to science and engineering endeavors, along with the invention of Calculus in the mid 17th century, led to the flourishing of the analytic branch in favor of synthetic approaches.

And so it remained until roughly the 19th century - it was at this point in time that it began to become apparent that alternative and equally valid non-Euclidean geometries could arise from the negation of the fifth postulate, leading to the study of elliptic and hyperbolic geometries. In particular, during this period there was a resurgence of the field of _projective geometry_, which was originally studied by Brunelleschi as the "geometry of perspective" in the 15th century, and reformulated in terms of "points at infinity" around the 17th century by Kepler and Desargues.

Around this time, a notion of _affine geometry_ had also come into the picture, which is roughly characterized as a generalization of Euclidean geometry in which the notion of absolute distance is forgotten, and the concepts that remain meaningful are instead the notions of parallel lines, collinearity, and the preservation of certain ratios. It was known early on that Euclidean geometry could be recovered as a special case of projective geometry, and as affine geometry and new non-Euclidean geometries were discovered, it was soon thought that _all_ such geometries could in fact be recovered in such a way, making projective geometry a more general and universal theory.

A major proponent of this point of view in the 19th century was Felix Klein (of Klein Bottle fame),  who sought to classify all geometries with his _Erlangen Program_. He believed that projective geometry would provide a unifying framework under which all other geometries could be united, and introduced the idea that such geometries could be characterized using the theory of groups. It was with the advent of Klein's program that traditionally synthetic approaches found rigorous footing in analytic and algebraic notions.

## The Erlangen Program: Euclidean Geometries

In particular, the program laid out a framework in which any given geometry could be categorized as a group of symmetries acting on a vector space. It is of some interest to see how these constructions

For example, fix some field $k$ - in the familiar setting, one might choose $\RR$, but many interesting ideas can be had by examining the general case. Ine can fix some coordinate system and consider sets of ordered $n$-tuples $k^n \definedas \theset{(k_1, k_2, \cdots k_n) \mid k_i \in k}$. Equipping this set with pointwise operations of addition and scalar multiplication, one can obtain a vector space $V_k$ of $n$ dimensions over the base field $k$. Then, given a vector space, one can consider linear maps from $V_k$ to itself, and if $n$ is finite, these are entirely characterized by $n\times n$ square matrices. In particular, one can form groups of such matrices, and examine the actions of groups upon $V_k$.

Since several such groups will be useful in our endeavor to recover some familiar geometries, a few definitions are in order. In each situation, it will be assumed that $k$ is a field, and $V_k$ is a vector space of finite dimension $n$ over the field $k$.

Definition: The set of $n\times m$ matrices with entries in $k$ will be denoted $M\_{n,m}(k)$. If $n=m$, this will simply be abbreviated to $M_n(k)$, which denotes the set of $n\times n$ matrices over $k$.

In general, any $n\times n$ matrix gives rise to a mapping from $V_k$ to itself via matrix-vector multiplication. One is often interested in such mappings that are invertible, which prompts the next definition.

Definition: The _general linear group of dimension $n$,_ $GL_n(K)$, is a group that is defined as the set $\theset{M \in M_n(k) \mid \det (M) \neq 0}$, the set of invertible $n\times n$ matrices with entries in $k$, equipped with matrix multiplication.

This can alternatively be characterized as a representation the set of all invertible linear maps from $V_k$ to itself, equipped with function composition. For the purpose of this discussion, this group is quite large, so we will be interested in certain subgroups.

Defintion: The _orthogonal group of dimension $n$_, $O_n(k)$, is defined as the set $\theset{M \in GL_n(k) \mid MM^T = I}$, where $M^T$ denotes the transpose of a matrix and $I$ denotes the unique identity matrix that satisfies $AI = IA = A$ for every $A\in M_n(K)$.

It can be shown $O_n(k)$ is in fact a subgroup of $GL_n(k)$. Equivalently, it can be characterized by those matrices $M$ for which $M^{-1}$ = $M^T$, and also those for which $\det M = \pm 1$. If one takes $k=\RR$, these are exactly the distance-preserving transformations (often referred to as \_isometries_) of $\RR^n$ that preserve the origin. Taking the dimension to be either 2 or 3 reveals that this produces a group consisting of both rotations around the origin, and reflections _through_ the origin.

In Euclidean geometry, one is also interested in translating and transporting one figure to another point in space, which motivates the next definition.

Definition: The _group of translations_ in vector space $V_k$ of dimension $n$ is denoted $T_n(k)$, and is equivalent to $k^n$, the set of all $n$-tuples with entries in $k$.

The above definition is a consequence of the fact that any translation can be identified with a vector along which the translation occurs, which does not depend on the point being considered.

Equipped with these definitions, we can finally define one of the main groups of interest: the Euclidean group.

Definition: The _Euclidean group of dimension n_ is the group defined by $E_n(k) \definedas T_n(k) \rtimes O_n(k)$, the semi-direct group product of the group of translations and the orthogonal group.

The purpose of this definition is to capture what is known about Euclidean geometry - it is invariant under "rigid motions", or isometries, which can in turn be characterized as the combination of translations, rotations, and reflections about lines. It turns out that these exact types of motions are what preserve the essential elements of classical Euclidean geometry - length, angle, ratios, parallel lines, and intersections of lines.

While defining the notion of a semidirect product is perhaps outisde the scope of this paper, it happens to be the exact algebraic tool that describes how such isometries can be constructed. In this case, it captures the notion the if one first performs a translation, followed by a rotation or reflection, this motion can equivalently be carried out by first performing the rotation or reflection, and then translating by the new rotated or reflected image of the original translation vector.

Taking a field such as $\RR$ and the dimension of $n=2$, we find that the vector space $\RR^2$ along with the group $E_2(\RR)$ provides enough information to completely characterize the usual notions of Euclidean geometry in the plane.

## Affine Geometries

In the affine case, one is often interested in maps $T: k^n \rightarrow k^n$ of the form $v \mapsto Mv + b$ where $M$ is a a linear translation and $b$ is another vector in $k^n$. These maps are often called _affine transformations_, and the resulting spaces are often described as "vector spaces in which the origin is forgotten." Another way of stating this is that allowing the morphisms to be both linear maps _and_ translations obviates the need for a distinguished zero vector, and allows one to equivalently treat similar figures without reference to an absolute coordinate system.

While this may seem like an abstract notion, it is in fact one that is commonly and implicitly used by anyone who has worked with vector spaces in any capacity: vector spaces are in fact affine spaces over themselves. It is this fact that allows one to denote a _vector_ in this space by an $n$-tuple of points, and to use the same notation for a _point_ of that space. Similarly, one commonly uses the affine structure of a vector space when transporting a vector to a chosen origin and treating it equivalently to the original vector.

Affine transformations are themselves more general than linear transformations. For one, linear maps must preserve the origin, sending zero to zero, while affine maps may not. In addition to the rotations and translations present in the Euclidean case, elements of the affine group additionally may induce both uniform and non-uniform scaling, as well as shearing of figures. And in contrast to the Euclidean case, affine transformations do not in general preserve angles and distances - they do, however, still preserve straight lines, and send parallel lines to parallel lines.

In order to obtain this type of geometry in the framework of the Erlangen program, one can carry out similar constructions to arrive at the following result:

Definition: The _affine group of dimension $n$_ is defined as $Aff_n(k) \definedas T_n(k) \rtimes GL_n(k)$.

As noted earlier, the group $O_n(k)$ is a subgroup of $GL_n(k)$, and so this result suggested to Klein and his contemporaries that Euclidean geometry was in fact a restriction, or special case, of affine geometry.

## Projective Geometries

In the case of projective geometry, one wants to introduce a notion of "perspective projection" in addition to the isometries obtained in the Euclidean and Affine cases. However, in order to do so, one must forego the preservation of parallel lines. This is a consequence of the early study of the subject, with respect to capturing 3 dimensional images on a 2 dimensional medium. This required the introduction of a point at which all parallel lines in the image would meet, which is now referred to as a _vanishing point_ or a _point at infinity_.

To see why Klein considered Projective geometry to be in some ways the most general and universal of the geometries known at his time, it suffices to carry out a similar construction in the projective case. One first takes a vector space $V_k$, constructs a group that will act as the symmetries of the desired, and identifies the geometry as the result that the group action on the

Definition: Given a group $G$, the _center_ of a group $Z(G)$ is defined as $Z(G) \definedas \theset{g\in G \mid gh = hg ~\forall h\in G}$, the set of elements that commute with every other element of the group.

Definition: The _projective linear group of dimension $n-1$_ is the group defined by $PGL\_{n-1}(k) = GL_n(k) / Z(GL_n(k))$, the general linear group quotiented by its center.

The $n+1$ condition is the first noticeable difference, which arises from the fact that a projective space of dimension $n$ is obtained from a vector spaces of dimension $n+1$, and the projective transformations (often called _homographies_) are induced by the linear transformations in that vector space. Such projective transformations play an important role in complex analysis, where one can realize the _Mobius group_ $PGL_2(\CC)$ as fractional linear transformations on the Riemann sphere $\CC \cup \theset{\infty}$, which could equivalently be denoted the \_complex projective line_.

It can then be shown that, for fixed $k$ and $n$, both the Euclidean and Affine groups are isomorphic to subgroups of the Projective group, and it is in this way that those geometries can be recovered as special cases of transformations on a projective space.

## Post-Erlangen Program

Armed with the tools of the Erlangen program, geometry once again become an active mathematical research topic, and its impact was felt throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. It was one of the first attempts at providing a unifying framework under which many disparate parts of mathematics could be connected and derived from one another, revealing new connections and insights.

It is a fact that the program was not all-encompassing - for example, tangential fields such as Riemannian geometry do not easily fit into this framework. But perhaps its most significant and lasting impact on Mathematics lies in its cultural effects, and in particular how mathematical knowledge is organized and synthesized. It proved the usefulness of having unifying frameworks, a theme that would become quite prominent in the 20th century and lay the groundwork for the invention of category theory in the 1940s.

# Geometry into the 20th Century

## The Italian School

Parallel to the Erlangen program, Algebraic Geometry progressed independently. It became clear that affine and projective spaces were fundamental to the subject, as were functions (and particularly polynomials) on those spaces. Major work was done in this area by a group referred to as "The Italian School" in Rome, primarily driven by Severi, Castelnuovo and Enriques. In order to discuss their work, it is necessary to introduce several more definitions.

Definition: _Affine $n$-space_ over a field $k$, denoted $A^n(k)$ is defined as the set of $n$-tuples $(k_1, k_2, \cdots k_n)$, along with the information of the vector spaces $V_k$ of dimension $n$ over $k$ and the action of the affine group $Aff_n(k)$ on $V_k$.

In many ways, this is very similar to the vector space $k^n$ defined previously, and in fact there is a map  $k^n \rightarrow A^n(k)$ that is colloquially referred to as "forgetting the origin", and a reverse map $A^n(k) \rightarrow k^n$ that amounts to choosing a coordinate system. An affine space is chosen generally when one doesn't need to full structure of a vector space, but would still like to consider notions such as points, relative distances, collinearity, and the other isometries preserved by the affine group.

If one then fixes some polynomial $p$ in the polynomial ring $k[x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n]$ over $n$ indeterminates with coefficients in $k$, one can examine points of the form $\bar{a} = (a_1, a_2, \cdots a_n)$ in $A^n(k)$ such that $p(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n) = 0$. The collection of such points is referred to as the \_zero locus_ of such a polynomial, or equivalently an _algebraic hypersurface_.

For example, take $k=\RR$ and consider polynomials of degree 2 in $k[x,y]$. In generality, the hypersurface of such a polynomial $p(x,y)$ will be defined by the relation $p(x,y) = Ax^2 + By^2 + Cxy + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, where the coefficents $A-F$ are taken to be real numbers. But this exactly describes the general equation of a conic section, as studied by the Greeks, and so we find that this new notion of a hypersurface perfectly generalizes algebraic surfaces such as conic sections, but allows for variation in both dimension and base field.

This prompts the following definition:

Definition: Given a set $S\subseteq k[x_1, x_2, \cdots x_n]$ of the form $S = \theset{p_1, p_2, \cdots p_m}$, the \_affine algebraic variety of $S$_ is defined as $V(S) = \theset{\bar{a} \definedas (a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n) \mid p_i(\bar{a}) = 0~ \forall p_i \in S}$. (Note that the set $S$ is sometimes referred to as a \_system_ of polynomials.)

In other words, one can take a number of polynomials and consider the points where they _simultaneously_ vanish, which is equivalent to looking at the intersections of their associated hypersurfaces, and combine all of this information into a structure called a _variety_. It is these objects -- roughly speaking, the zero loci of polynomials -- that form one of the fundamental structures upon which much Algebraic Geometry is based.

To see why such an object may be interesting, take $k=\RR$, the ring $k[x,y]$, and consider the polynomial $p_1(x,y) = y^2-x^3$. The variety $V(\theset{p1})$ traces out an \_elliptic curve_ in the $x$-$y$ plane, shown in the first figure below, an object with a rich analytic and algebraic structure. In contrast, consider also the polynomial $p_2(x,y) = y^2-x^3+x$, then $V(\theset{p_2})$ is also an elliptic curve, as shown in the second figure. Finally, consider $p_3(x,y) = y^{2} - x^{3}-3x^{2}$, shown in the third figure.

An immediate qualitative difference is that $p_1$ has a "cusp" near 0, where it may be unclear what the correct assignment of a tangent line should be, while the second is "smooth" but also has a "double point" at which there are two possible choices for a tangent line. The third, on the other hand, does not seem to exhibit any such irregularities, which are in general referred to as \_singularities_ of the curve, and so one might be inclined to wonder what causes such singularities to occur, and if there are perhaps conditions on the polynomials themselves that might guarantee that the curves generated contain no such singularities.

Such questions drove many results in the classification of algebraic curves, and it was found that the _genus_ associated to the curve, an essentially topological property, was a powerful tool in such classifications. It was the extension of these ideas to the classification algebraic _surfaces_ in higher dimensions that the Italian school focused their efforts on. To this end, many results were produced, but their results and methods of proof have remained contentious throughout the 20th century.

## The Weil Conjectures and Grothendieck

Various progress in other areas of geometry was made throughout the first half of the 20th century, most notably the advances of Hilbert and his proof of the _Nullstellensatz_ (roughly translated as "theorem of zero loci"). Recalling that a variety was defined over system $S$ of polynomials, where $S$ is contained in some polynomial ring $k[x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n]$, one form of the _Nullstellensatz_ shows that if one wants to check whether the variety $V(S)$ is nonempty, one can equivalently check whether $S$ is a (proper) ideal in this ring. This firmly cemented the link between Algebra and Geometry, providing a bridge that allowed many of the tools from either one of these fields to be used in the other.

Around 1950, a mathematician named Andre Weil set forth "The Weil Conjectures", three proposals that stem from setting $k$ to be a finite field, considering the resulting varieties, and defining analogs of the Riemann-Zeta function in order to count the number of rational points on the resulting algebraic curves. Weil conjectured that certain properties similar to the traditional Zeta function should hold, particular with respect to the locations of their zeros.

In doing so, he was able to formulate an analog of the Riemann Hypothesis for this situation, and further conjectured that many of the newly formed tools of homological algebra could be brought to bear on such a problem. Homological tools had proved to be both powerful and successful in topology in the first half of the century, and it was at this point that many researchers were beginning to generalize such theories and apply them to other areas. In particular, Weil suspected that applying homological methods from algebraic topology to these conjectures would have significant number-theoretic ramifications.

It is here that Alexandre Grothendieck enters the picture, as well as his contemporary John-Pierre Serre, for within 15 years Grothendieck had published solutions to two out of three of these conjectures. In the process, he introduced many of the tools that would become standard in modern Algebraic Geometry - his major contributions being in the development of the necessary homological tools, a cohomology theory for varieties. Such contributions were framed with in the recently developed language of category theory, and included the definitions of abelian categories, derived functors, injective resolutions, schemes, and sheaves.

Grothendieck's general approach, which has gained traction widely across mathematics in the resulting years, was noticing that certain classes of geometric objects could be characterized by instead considering all of the maps _into_ that object from other similar objects. In particular, this applies to algebraic variety - one can associate to a given variety a collection of particularly well-behaved functions on that variety, the so-called "regular" functions, and in this way study the variety itself.

This collection of functions constitutes the simplest example of of a _sheaf_, modulo a number of technical conditions that must be taken care of first. Perhaps more surprisingly, this collection forms a ring. Given any ring $R$, one can form the set of prime ideals of $R$, denoted $\text{SPec}(R)$, and even equip with with a topology (what is usually referred to as the _Zariski topology_. If one then introduces a topological space into the picture, there is a construction entitled the _structure sheaf_ on the space which contains information about the functions on that space, and taking a topological space along with such a structure sheaf produces the construction known as a _scheme_.

Although the construction of scheme itself is detailed, its power lies in its similarity to notions in differential geometry, where homological methods had been successfully applied. It is in this way that many powerful tools from the study of manifolds can be generalized to work on algebraic objects, and similarly to allow advances in the algebraic theory of rings to be brought to bear on geometric problems.

However, such constructions proved to not just be limited to interplays between geometry, topology, and algebra, but as Weil had hoped, laid the groundwork for many of these tools to be applied to number theory. This culminated in the celebrated proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in the 1990s, which built upon on many of the tools developed during this period.

In summary, perhaps the most notable influence of Algebraic Geometry on the face of mathematics has been the bridges it has created between different fields. In its study, many mathematical "rosetta stones" have been built, allowing deeper connections to be built between disparate fields of mathematics, and moreover making possible the transport of power techniques across seemingly disparate domains. In the latter half of the 20th century, Grothendieck made the decision to quit Mathematics, and spent most of his remaining days living in the Pyrenees in solitude until his death in 2014. And although mathematics is not a lone endeavor, it is particularly hard to overstate the singular contributions of Grothendieck, for his ideas permeate Mathematics to this day.

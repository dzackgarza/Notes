- Scratchwork on separate paper, write up / present solutions

- $f_0 = \sqrt{x}$. 

- Throw away paper! Scratchwork not necessary.

- Extra credit: 20pts = 1 quiz

- Office hours: free tutoring by a professional

- Evidence vs proof: graphing yields the conjecture, algebra yields the proof

- Can't do the following: take $f(x) = x^2$
\[  
a^2 = b^2 \\
\implies \sqrt{a^2} = \sqrt{b^2} \\
\implies a = b
\]
  thus $f$ is injective.

  - But take $a=2, b=-2$, then $f(a) = f(b) = 4$ but $a\neq b$. 
    What went wrong?

- What is and is not exponential: $x^c$ vs $c^x$

- Solving exponential equations: $5x^{1\over 7} = 3$.
  - Replace with greek letters

- Worksheet 3.4, part 1: shifting
- Worksheet 3.4, part 4: sample problems


- Poll: what's useful for class. Groupwork on worksheets? Lectures on big ideas? More calculations/examples?


- Grammarly

- Select pages you actually want me to look at / want feedback on.

- Switching approach: grading will be more strict, and ask for feedback iff you want it
  
  - Less than 90% average on preclasses: will likely be issues

- Error checking: run argument backwards.

- Common error: $\ln(y^2 - 16) = 2\ln(y-16)$

- How to investigate: $(x-\phi)^n(x-\psi)$.

- Refer to any posted notes first?

- $A(t)$ computes total balance, not interest.

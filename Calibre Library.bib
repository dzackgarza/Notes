    author = "James J. Callahan",
    note = "A half-century ago, advanced calculus was a well-de?ned subject at the core of the undergraduate mathematics curriulum. The classic texts of Taylor [19], Buck [1], Widder [21], and Kaplan [9], for example, show some of the ways it was approached. Over time, certain aspects of the course came to be seen as more signi?cant—those seen as giving a rigorous foundation to calculus—and they - came the basis for a new course, an introduction to real analysis, that eventually supplanted advanced calculus in the core. Advanced calculus did not, in the process, become less important, but its role in the curriculum changed. In fact, a bifurcation occurred. In one direction we got c- culus on n-manifolds, a course beyond the practical reach of many undergraduates; in the other, we got calculus in two and three dimensions but still with the theorems of Stokes and Gauss as the goal. The latter course is intended for everyone who has had a year-long introduction to calculus; it often has a name like Calculus III. In my experience, though, it does not manage to accomplish what the old advancedcalculus course did. Multivariable calculusnaturallysplits intothreeparts:(1)severalfunctionsofonevariable,(2)one function of several variables, and (3) several functions of several variables. The ?rst two are well-developed in Calculus III, but the third is really too large and varied to be treated satisfactorily in the time remaining at the end of a semester. To put it another way: Green’s theorem ?ts comfortably; Stokes’ and Gauss’ do not.

    note = "This radical first course on complex analysis brings a beautiful and powerful subject to life by consistently using geometry (not calculation) as the means of explanation. Aimed at undergraduate students in mathematics, physics, and engineering, the book's intuitive explanations, lack of advanced prerequisites, and consciously user-friendly prose style will help students to master the subject more readily than was previously possible. The key to this is the book's use of new geometric arguments in place of the standard calculational ones. These geometric arguments are communicated with the aid of hundreds of diagrams of a standard seldom encountered in mathematical works. A new approach to a classical topic, this work will be of interest to students in mathematics, physics, and engineering, as well as to professionals in these fields.

    note = "This is a textbook for an introductory combinatorics course that can take up one or two semesters. An extensive list of problems, ranging from routine exercises to research questions, is included. In each section, there are also exercises that contain material not explicitly discussed in the preceding text, so as to provide instructors with extra choices if they want to shift the emphasis of their course. Just as with the first edition, the new edition walks the reader through the classic parts of combinatorial enumeration and graph theory, while also discussing some recent progress in the area: on the one hand, providing material that will help students learn the basic techniques, and on the other hand, showing that some questions at the forefront of research are comprehensible and accessible for the talented and hard-working undergraduate. The basic topics discussed are: the twelvefold way, cycles in permutations, the formula of inclusion and exclusion, the notion of graphs and trees, matchings and Eulerian and Hamiltonian cycles. The selected advanced topics are: Ramsey theory, pattern avoidance, the probabilistic method, partially ordered sets, and algorithms and complexity. As the goal of the book is to encourage students to learn more combinatorics, every effort has been made to provide them with a not only useful, but also enjoyable and engaging reading.

    title_sort = "Understanding Analysis (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)",
    author_sort = "Abbott, Stephen",
    author = "Stephen Abbott",
    note = "This lively introductory text exposes the student to the rewards of a rigorous study of functions of a real variable. In each chapter, informal discussions of questions that give analysis its inherent fascination are followed by precise, but not overly formal, developments of the techniques needed to make sense of them. By focusing on the unifying themes of approximation and the resolution of paradoxes that arise in the transition from the finite to the infinite, the text turns what could be a daunting cascade of definitions and theorems into a coherent and engaging progression of ideas. Acutely aware of the need for rigor, the student is much better prepared to understand what constitutes a proper mathematical proof and how to write one.
Fifteen years of classroom experience with the first edition of *Understanding Analysis* have solidified and refined the central narrative of the second edition. Roughly 150 new exercises join a selection of the best exercises from the first edition, and three more project-style sections have been added. Investigations of Euler’s computation of ζ(2), the Weierstrass Approximation ­ Theorem, and the gamma function are now among the book’s cohort of seminal results serving as motivation and payoff for the beginning student to master the methods of analysis.

    note = "We have tried to design this book for both instructional and reference use, during and after a first course in algebraic topology aimed at users rather than developers; indeed, the book arose from such courses taught by the authors. We start gently, with numerous pictures to illustrate the fundamental ideas and constructions in homotopy theory that are needed in later chapters. A certain amount of redundancy is built in for the reader's convenience: we hope to minimize :fiipping back and forth, and we have provided some appendices for reference. The first three are concerned with background material in algebra, general topology, manifolds, geometry and bundles. Another gives tables of homo topy groups that should prove useful in computations, and the last outlines the use of a computer algebra package for exterior calculus. Our approach has been that whenever a construction from a proof is needed, we have explicitly noted and referenced this. In general, wehavenot given a proof unless it yields something useful for computations. As always, the only way to un derstand mathematics is to do it and use it. To encourage this, Ex denotes either an example or an exercise. The choice is usually up to you the reader, depending on the amount of work you wish to do; however, some are explicitly stated as ( unanswered) questions. In such cases, our implicit claim is that you will greatly benefit from at least thinking about how to answer them.

\#\#\# Review
First Edition Review:
{"}Naber’s book, together with its predecessor[N4] subtitled Foundations, occupies a less populated niche in the market. This is the sector of teachable texts on differential geometry and its use in physics. Teachability does not refer to a definition-theorem-proof format. Nor does it imply anything about the depth of the treatment. Rather, it has to do with the organization of the topics, the selection of examples, the amount of instructive details provided, the ability to anticipate questions from the reader, and knowing when to stop.{"}
\\--SIAM REVIEW
\#\#\# From the Back Cover
This is a book on topology and geometry, and like any book on subjects as vast as these, it has a point of view that guided the selection of topics. The author’s point of view is that the rekindled interest that mathematics and physics have shown in each other of late should be fostered, and that this is best accomplished by allowing them to cohabit. The goal is to weave together rudimentary notions from the classical gauge theories of physics and the topological and geometrical concepts that became the mathematical models of these notions. The reader is assumed to have a minimal understanding of what an electromagnetic field is, a willingness to accept a few of the more elementary pronouncements of quantum mechanics, and a solid background in real analysis and linear algebra with some of the vocabulary of modern algebra. To such a reader we offer an excursion that begins with the definition of a topological space and finds its way eventually to the moduli space of anti-self-dual SU(2)-connections on S4 with instanton number -1. This second edition of the book includes a new chapter on singular homology theory and a new appendix outlining Donaldson’s beautiful application of gauge theory to the topology of compact, simply connected , smooth 4-manifolds with definite intersection form. Reviews of the first edition: “It is unusual to find a book so carefully tailored to the needs of this interdisciplinary area of mathematical physics…Naber combines a deep knowledge of his subject with an excellent informal writing style.” (NZMS Newsletter) {"}...this book should be very interesting for mathematicians and physicists (as well as other scientists) who are concerned with gauge theories.{"} (ZENTRALBLATT FUER MATHEMATIK) “The book is well written and the examples do a great service to the reader. It will be a helpful companion to anyone teaching or studying gauge theory …” (Mathematical Reviews)

The first four chapters introduce the central ideas of string theory, the tools of conformal field theory and of the Polyakov path integral, and the covariant quantization of the string. The next three chapters treat string interactions: the general formalism, and detailed treatments of the tree level and one loop amplitudes. Chapter eight covers toroidal compactification and many important aspects of string physics, such as T-duality and D-branes. Chapter nine treats higher-order amplitudes, including an analysis of their finiteness and unitarity, and various nonperturbative ideas. An appendix giving a short course on path integral methods is included. This is an essential text and reference for graduate students and researchers interested in modern superstring theory.

Sheaf theory is also important in other fields of mathematics, notably algebraic geometry, but that is outside the scope of the present book. Thus a more descriptive title for this book might have been Algebraic Topology from the Point of View of Sheaf Theory. Several innovations will be found in this book. Notably, the con cept of the {"}tautness{"} of a subspace (an adaptation of an analogous no tion of Spanier to sheaf-theoretic cohomology) is introduced and exploited throughout the book. The fact that sheaf-theoretic cohomology satisfies 1 the homotopy property is proved for general topological spaces. Also, relative cohomology is introduced into sheaf theory. Concerning relative cohomology, it should be noted that sheaf-theoretic cohomology is usually considered as a {"}single space{"} theory.

Two books discussing more recent results are Weibel, An Introduction to Homological Algebra, 1994, and Gelfand– Manin, Methods of Homological Algebra, 2003. In their Foreword, Gelfand and Manin divide the history of Homological Algebra into three periods: the rst period ended in the early 1960s, culminating in applications of Ho- logical Algebra to regular local rings. The second period, greatly in uenced by the work of A. Grothendieck and J. -P. Serre, continued through the 1980s; it involves abelian categories and sheaf cohomology. The third period, - volving derived categories and triangulated categories, is still ongoing. Both of these newer books discuss all three periods (see also Kashiwara–Schapira, Categories and Sheaves). The original version of this book discussed the rst period only; this new edition remains at the same introductory level, but it now introduces the second period as well. This change makes sense pe- gogically, for there has been a change in the mathematics population since 1979; today, virtually all mathematics graduate students have learned so- thing about functors and categories, and so I can now take the categorical viewpoint more seriously. When I was a graduate student, Homological Algebra was an unpopular subject. The general attitude was that it was a grotesque formalism, boring to learn, and not very useful once one had learned it.

This new edition of the widely used analysis book continues to cover real analysis in greater detail and at a more advanced level than most books on the subject. Encompassing several subjects that underlie much of modern analysis, the book focuses on measure and integration theory, point set topology, and the basics of functional analysis. It illustrates the use of the general theories and introduces readers to other branches of analysis such as Fourier analysis, distribution theory, and probability theory. This edition is bolstered in content as well as in scope-extending its usefulness to students outside of pure analysis as well as those interested in dynamical systems. The numerous exercises, extensive bibliography, and review chapter on sets and metric spaces make Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications, Second Edition invaluable for students in graduate-level analysis courses. New features include: * Revised material on the n-dimensional Lebesgue integral. * An improved proof of Tychonoff's theorem. * Expanded material on Fourier analysis. * A newly written chapter devoted to distributions and differential equations. * Updated material on Hausdorff dimension and fractal dimension.

Using the W.L. Putnam Mathematical Competition for undergraduates as an inspiring symbol to build an appropriate math background for graduate studies in pure or applied mathematics, the reader is eased into transitioning from problem-solving at the high school level to the university and beyond, that is, to mathematical research. Key features of Putnam and Beyond * Preliminary material provides an overview of common methods of proof: argument by contradiction, mathematical induction, pigeonhole principle, ordered sets, and invariants. * Each chapter systematically presents a single subject within which problems are clustered in every section according to the specific topic. * The exposition is driven by more than 1100 problems and examples chosen from numerous sources from around the world; many original contributions come from the authors. * Complete solutions to all problems are given at the end of the book. The source, author, and historical background are cited whenever possible. This work may be used as a study guide for the Putnam exam, as a text for many different problem-solving courses, and as a source of problems for standard courses in undergraduate mathematics. Putnam and Beyond is organized for self-study by undergraduate and graduate students, as well as teachers and researchers in the physical sciences who wish to to expand their mathematical horizons.

The approach taken by the authors in Problems in Algebraic Number Theory is based on the principle that questions focus and orient the mind. The book is a collection of about 500 problems in algebraic number theory, systematically arranged to reveal ideas and concepts in the evolution of the subject. While some problems are easy and straightforward, others are more difficult. For this new edition the authors added a chapter and revised several sections. The text is suitable for a first course in algebraic number theory with minimal supervision by the instructor. The exposition facilitates independent study, and students having taken a basic course in calculus, linear algebra, and abstract algebra will find these problems interesting and challenging.

    note = "Preface to the Instructor This is a text for a one-quarter or one-semester course in probability, aimed at stu dents who have done a year of calculus. The book is organized so a student can learn the fundamental ideas of probability from the first three chapters without reliance on calculus. Later chapters develop these ideas further using calculus tools. The book contains more than the usual number of examples worked out in detail. It is not possible to go through all these examples in class. Rather, I suggest that you deal quickly with the main points of theory, then spend class time on problems from the exercises, or your own favorite problems. The most valuable thing for students to learn from a course like this is how to pick up a probability problem in a new setting and relate it to the standard body of theory. The more they see this happen in class, and the more they do it themselves in exercises, the better. The style of the text is deliberately informal. My experience is that students learn more from intuitive explanations, diagrams, and examples than they do from theo rems and proofs. So the emphasis is on problem solving rather than theory.

    note = "Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning grew out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same ?eld, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years. In particular, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic models. Also, the practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation pro- gation. Similarly, new models based on kernels have had signi?cant impact on both algorithms and applications. This new textbook re?ects these recent developments while providing a comp- hensive introduction to the ?elds of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or ?rst year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or - chine learning concepts. Knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some familiarity with probabilities would be helpful though not - sential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.

In a disarmingly simple, step-by-step style that never sacrifices mathematical rigor, the authors — Morris Tenenbaum of Cornell University, and Harry Pollard of Purdue University — introduce and explain complex, critically-important concepts to undergraduate students of mathematics, engineering and the sciences.The book begins with a section that examines the origin of differential equations, defines basic terms and outlines the general solution of a differential equation-the solution that actually contains every solution of such an equation. Subsequent sections deal with such subjects as: integrating factors; dilution and accretion problems; the algebra of complex numbers; the linearization of first order systems; Laplace Transforms; Newton's Interpolation Formulas; and Picard's Method of Successive Approximations.The book contains two exceptional chapters: one on series methods of solving differential equations, the second on numerical methods of solving differential equations. The first includes a discussion of the Legendre Differential Equation, Legendre Functions, Legendre Polynomials, the Bessel Differential Equation, and the Laguerre Differential Equation. Throughout the book, every term is clearly defined and every theorem lucidly and thoroughly analyzed, and there is an admirable balance between the theory of differential equations and their application. An abundance of solved problems and practice exercises enhances the value of Ordinary Differential Equations as a classroom text for undergraduate students and teaching professionals. The book concludes with an in-depth examination of existence and uniqueness theorems about a variety of differential equations, as well as an introduction to the theory of determinants and theorems about Wronskians.

    note = "One of the most cited books in mathematics, John Milnor's exposition of Morse theory has been the most important book on the subject for more than forty years. Morse theory was developed in the 1920s by mathematician Marston Morse. (Morse was on the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study, and Princeton published his Topological Methods in the Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable in the Annals of Mathematics Studies series in 1947.) One classical application of Morse theory includes the attempt to understand, with only limited information, the large-scale structure of an object. This kind of problem occurs in mathematical physics, dynamic systems, and mechanical engineering. Morse theory has received much attention in the last two decades as a result of a famous paper in which theoretical physicist Edward Witten relates Morse theory to quantum field theory. Milnor was awarded the Fields Medal (the mathematical equivalent of a Nobel Prize) in 1962 for his work in differential topology. He has since received the National Medal of Science (1967) and the Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society twice (1982 and 2004) in recognition of his explanations of mathematical concepts across a wide range of scienti.c disciplines. The citation reads, {"}The phrase sublime elegance is rarely associated with mathematical exposition, but it applies to all of Milnor's writings. Reading his books, one is struck with the ease with which the subject is unfolding and it only becomes apparent after re.ection that this ease is the mark of a master.' Milnor has published five books with Princeton University Press.

These symmetry groups may be represented by matrices, which allows them to be studied by elementary methods from calculus and linear algebra. This naive approach to Lie theory is originally due to von Neumann, and it is now possible to streamline it by using standard results of undergraduate mathematics. To compensate for the limitations of the naive approach, end of chapter discussions introduce important results beyond those proved in the book, as part of an informal sketch of Lie theory and its history. John Stillwell is Professor of Mathematics at the University of San Francisco. He is the author of several highly regarded books published by Springer, including The Four Pillars of Geometry (2005), Elements of Number Theory (2003), Mathematics and Its History (Second Edition, 2002), Numbers and Geometry (1998) and Elements of Algebra (1994).

The fact that the topics are introduced in their historical contexts will enable students to better appreciate and understand the mathematical ideas involved...If one constructs a list of topics central to a history course, then they would closely resemble those chosen here.{"}(David Parrott, Australian Mathematical Society){"}The book...is presented in a lively style without unnecessary detail. It is very stimulating and will be appreciated not only by students. Much attention is paid to problems and to the development of mathematics before the end of the nineteenth century... This book brings to the non-specialist interested in mathematics many interesting results. It can be recommended for seminars and will be enjoyed by the broad mathematical community.{"} (European Mathematical Society){"}Since Stillwell treats many topics, most mathematicians will learn a lot from this book as well as they will find pleasant and rather clear expositions of custom materials. The book is accessible to students that have already experienced calculus, algebra and geometry and will give them a good account of how the different branches of mathematics interact.{"}(Denis Bonheure, Bulletin of the Belgian Society)This third edition includes new chapters on simple groups and combinatorics, and new sections on several topics, including the Poincare conjecture. The book has also been enriched by added exercises.

    note = "With graduate school, young mathematicians take the first step toward a career in mathematics. During this period, they make important decisions that will affect the rest of their careers. Here now is a detailed guide to help students navigate those years and the years that follow. In his inimitable and forthright style, Steven Krantz addresses the major issues of graduate school, including deciding where to go, passing the qualifying exams, finding an advisor, writing a thesis, and getting that first job. As with his earlier guide, How to Teach Mathematics, Krantz avoids generalities, giving clear advice on how to handle real situations. In addition, he includes a description of the basic elements of a mathematical education, as well as three appendices on the structure of a typical department and university and the standard academic ranks. Steven G. Krantz is an experienced mathematician and an award-winning author. He has worked in many different types of mathematics departments, supervised both masters and doctoral students, and is currently the Chair of the Mathematics Department at Washington University in St. Louis.Other AMS titles by Steven Krantz are A Primer of Mathematical Writing and Techniques of Problem Solving.

\#\#\# Review
“This is the third edition of this well-known introduction to linear algebra. The main changes, apart from the usual improvements during a new edition, are the number of exercises which has more than doubled, new formatting including color printing, new sections on product spaces, quotient spaces, duality, and the chapter on ‘Operators on Real Vector Spaces’ … . if you liked the previous editions, you will like this new edition even better!” (G. Teschl, Monatshefte für Mathematik, 2016)
“This third edition, appearing eighteen years after the second edition, is a further polishing of the existing approach. This book was and still is an interesting and useful text for a second course in linear algebra, concentrating on proofs after the concepts and mechanics have been covered in a first course.” (Allen Stenger, MAA Reviews, maa.org, May, 2016)
AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL MONTHLY  
{"}The determinant-free proofs are elegant and intuitive.{"}
CHOICE   
{"}Every discipline of higher mathematics evinces the profound importance of linear algebra in some way, either for the power derived from its techniques or the inspiration offered by its concepts. Axler demotes determinants (usually quite a central technique in the finite dimensional setting, though marginal in infinite dimensions) to a minor role. To so consistently do without determinants constitutes a tour de forces in the service of simplicity and clarity; these are also well served by the general precision of Axler’s prose. Students with a view towards applied mathematics, analysis, or operator theory will be well served. The most original linear algebra book to appear in years, it certainly belongs in every undergraduate library.{"} 
ZENTRALBLATT MATH   
{"}Altogether, the text is a didactic masterpiece.{"}

{"}Clarity through examples is emphasized … the text is ideal for class exercises … I congratulate the author and the publisher for a well-produced textbook on linear algebra.{"}

    note = "Introductory Complex Analysis is a scaled-down version of A. I. Markushevich's masterly three-volume {"}Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable.{"} Dr. Richard Silverman, the editor and translator of the original, has prepared this shorter version expressly to meet the needs of a one-year graduate or undergraduate course in complex analysis. In his selection and adaptation of the more elementary topics from the original larger work, he was guided by a brief course prepared by Markushevich himself.  
The book begins with fundamentals, with a definition of complex numbers, their geometric representation, their algebra, powers and roots of complex numbers, set theory as applied to complex analysis, and complex functions and sequences. The notions of proper and improper complex numbers and of infinity are fully and clearly explained, as is stereographic projection. Individual chapters then cover limits and continuity, differentiation of analytic functions, polynomials and rational functions, Mobius transformations with their circle-preserving property, exponentials and logarithms, complex integrals and the Cauchy theorem , complex series and uniform convergence, power series, Laurent series and singular points, the residue theorem and its implications, harmonic functions (a subject too often slighted in first courses in complex analysis), partial fraction expansions, conformal mapping, and analytic continuation.  
Elementary functions are given a more detailed treatment than is usual for a book at this level. Also, there is an extended discussion of the Schwarz-Christolfel transformation, which is particularly important for applications.  
There is a great abundance of worked-out examples, and over three hundred problems (some with hints and answers), making this an excellent textbook for classroom use as well as for independent study. A noteworthy feature is the fact that the parentage of this volume makes it possible for the student to pursue various advanced topics in more detail in the three-volume original, without the problem of having to adjust to a new terminology and notation .  
In this way, *Introductory* *Complex Analysis* serves as an introduction not only to the whole field of complex analysis, but also to the magnum opus of an important contemporary Russian mathematician.

\#\#\# Review
From the reviews of the second edition:
“It starts off with five chapters covering basics on smooth manifolds up to submersions, immersions, embeddings, and of course submanifolds. … the book under review is laden with excellent exercises that significantly further the reader’s understanding of the material, and Lee takes great pains to motivate everything well all the way through … . a fine graduate-level text for differential geometers as well as people like me, fellow travelers who always wish they knew more about such a beautiful subject.” (Michael Berg, MAA Reviews, October, 2012)

This book provides a unified account of homological algebra as it exists today. The historical connection with topology, regular local rings, and semi-simple Lie algebras are also described. This book is suitable for second or third year graduate students. The first half of the book takes as its subject the canonical topics in homological algebra: derived functors, Tor and Ext, projective dimensions and spectral sequences. Homology of group and Lie algebras illustrate these topics. Intermingled are less canonical topics, such as the derived inverse limit functor lim1, local cohomology, Galois cohomology, and affine Lie algebras. The last part of the book covers less traditional topics that are a vital part of the modern homological toolkit: simplicial methods, Hochschild and cyclic homology, derived categories and total derived functors. By making these tools more accessible, the book helps to break down the technological barrier between experts and casual users of homological algebra.

Once these ideas are established, the author goes on to show that the scope of harmonic analysis extends far beyond the setting of the circle group, and he opens the door to other contexts by considering Fourier transforms on the real line as well as a brief look at Fourier analysis on locally compact abelian groups.

The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called “Divide-and-Conquer”), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many exercises and problems have been added for this edition. The international paperback edition is no longer available; the hardcover is available worldwide.

The authors Gelfand and Manin explain all the main ideas of the theory of derived categories. Both authors are well-known researchers and the second, Manin, is famous for his work in algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. The book is an excellent reference for graduate students and researchers in mathematics and also for physicists who use methods from algebraic geometry and algebraic topology.

They then computed the Fourier coefficients of these forms in terms of period integrals and L-functions. In this book the authors take an alternate approach to these theorems and generalize them to the setting of Hilbert modular varieties of arbitrary dimension. The approach is conceptual and uses tools that were not available to Hirzebruch and Zagier, including intersection homology theory, properties of modular cycles, and base change. Automorphic vector bundles, Hecke operators and Fourier coefficients of modular forms are presented both in the classical and adèlic settings. The book should provide a foundation for approaching similar questions for other locally symmetric spaces.

    note = "During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.

It is designed for an introductory probability course taken by mathematics, the physical and social sciences, engineering, and computer science students. The text can be used in a variety of course lengths, levels, and areas of emphasis. For use in a standard one-term course, in which both discrete and continuous probability is covered, students should have taken as a prerequisite two terms of calculus, including an introduction to multiple integrals. In order to cover Chapter 11, which contains material on Markov chains, some knowledge of matrix theory is necessary. The text can also be used in a discrete probability course. For use in a discrete probability course, students should have taken one term of calculus as a prerequisite. All of the computer programs that are used in the text have been written in each of the languages TrueBASIC, Maple, and Mathematica. Contents: 1) Discrete Probability Distributions. 2) Continuous Probability Densities. 3) Combinatorics. 4) Conditional Probability. 5) Distributions and Densities. 6) Expected Value and Variance. 7) Sums of Random Variables. 8) Law of Large Numbers. 9) Central Limit Theorem. 10) Generating Functions. 11) Markov Chains. 12) Random Walks.

Volume 3 begins with the essential aspects of the theory of locales, proceeding to a study in chapter 2 of the sheaves on a locale and on a topological space, in their various equivalent presentations: functors, etale maps or W-sets. Next, this situation is generalized to the case of sheaves on a site and the corresponding notion of Grothendieck topos is introduced. Chapter 4 relates the theory of Grothendieck toposes with that of accessible categories and sketches, by proving the existence of a classifying topos for all coherent theories.

    note = "Many people think there is only one “right” way to teach geometry. For two millennia, the “right” way was Euclid’s way, and it is still good in many respects. But in the 1950s the cry “Down with triangles!” was heard in France and new geometry books appeared, packed with linear algebra but with no diagrams. Was this the new “right” way, or was the “right” way something else again, perhaps transformation groups? In this book, I wish to show that geometry can be developed in four fundamentally different ways, and that all should be used if the subject is to be shown in all its splendor. Euclid-style construction and axiomatics seem the best way to start, but linear algebra smooths the later stages by replacing some tortuous arguments by simple calculations. And how can one avoid projective geometry? It not only explains why objects look the way they do; it also explains why geometry is entangled with algebra. Finally, one needs to know that there is not one geometry, but many, and transformation groups are the best way to distinguish between them. Two chapters are devoted to each approach: The ?rst is concrete and introductory, whereas the second is more abstract. Thus, the ?rst chapter on Euclid is about straightedge and compass constructions; the second is about axioms and theorems. The ?rst chapter on linear algebra is about coordinates; the second is about vector spaces and the inner product.

    note = "The purpose of this book is to give a systematic development of differential and integral calculus for functions of several variables. The traditional topics from advanced calculus are included: maxima and minima, chain rule, implicit function theorem, multiple integrals, divergence and Stokes's theorems, and so on. However, the treatment differs in several important respects from the traditional one. Vector notation is used throughout, and the distinction is maintained between n-dimensional euclidean space En and its dual. The elements of the Lebesgue theory of integrals are given. In place of the traditional vector analysis in £3, we introduce exterior algebra and the calculus of exterior differential forms. The formulas of vector analysis then become special cases of formulas about differential forms and integrals over manifolds lying in P. The book is suitable for a one-year course at the advanced undergraduate level. By omitting certain chapters, a one semester course can be based on it. For instance, if the students already have a good knowledge of partial differentiation and the elementary topology of P, then substantial parts of Chapters 4, 5, 7, and 8 can be covered in a semester. Some knowledge of linear algebra is presumed. However, results from linear algebra are reviewed as needed (in some cases without proof). A number of changes have been made in the first edition. Many of these were suggested by classroom experience. A new Chapter 2 on elementary topology has been added.

The theory has emerged over recent decades as essential both for the analysis of algorithms and for the study of scientific models in many disciplines, including probability theory, statistical physics, computational biology, and information theory. With a careful combination of symbolic enumeration methods and complex analysis, drawing heavily on generating functions, results of sweeping generality emerge that can be applied in particular to fundamental structures such as permutations, sequences, strings, walks, paths, trees, graphs and maps. This account is the definitive treatment of the topic. The authors give full coverage of the underlying mathematics and a thorough treatment of both classical and modern applications of the theory. The text is complemented with exercises, examples, appendices and notes to aid understanding. The book can be used for an advanced undergraduate or a graduate course, or for self-study.

Essential and fundamental ideas are presented in an effort to make the book accessible to a broad audience, and, in addition, their applications to signal processing are kept at an elementary level. The book begins with an introduction to vector spaces, inner product spaces, and other preliminary topics in analysis. Subsequent chapters feature: The development of a Fourier series, Fourier transform, and discrete Fourier analysis Improved sections devoted to continuous wavelets and two-dimensional wavelets The analysis of Haar, Shannon, and linear spline wavelets The general theory of multi-resolution analysis Updated MATLAB code and expanded applications to signal processing The construction, smoothness, and computation of Daubechies' wavelets Advanced topics such as wavelets in higher dimensions, decomposition and reconstruction, and wavelet transform Applications to signal processing are provided throughout the book, most involving the filtering and compression of signals from audio or video. Some of these applications are presented first in the context of Fourier analysis and are later explored in the chapters on wavelets. New exercises introduce additional applications, and complete proofs accompany the discussion of each presented theory. Extensive appendices outline more advanced proofs and partial solutions to exercises as well as updated MATLAB routines that supplement the presented examples. A First Course in Wavelets with Fourier Analysis, Second Edition is an excellent book for courses in mathematics and engineering at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable resource for mathematicians, signal processing engineers, and scientists who wish to learn about wavelet theory and Fourier analysis on an elementary level.

Yet Euler's formula is so simple it can be explained to a child. Euler's Gem tells the illuminating story of this indispensable mathematical idea. From ancient Greek geometry to today's cutting-edge research, Euler's Gem celebrates the discovery of Euler's beloved polyhedron formula and its far-reaching impact on topology, the study of shapes. In 1750, Euler observed that any polyhedron composed of V vertices, E edges, and F faces satisfies the equation V-E+F=2. David Richeson tells how the Greeks missed the formula entirely; how Descartes almost discovered it but fell short; how nineteenth-century mathematicians widened the formula's scope in ways that Euler never envisioned by adapting it for use with doughnut shapes, smooth surfaces, and higher dimensional shapes; and how twentieth-century mathematicians discovered that every shape has its own Euler's formula. Using wonderful examples and numerous illustrations, Richeson presents the formula's many elegant and unexpected applications, such as showing why there is always some windless spot on earth, how to measure the acreage of a tree farm by counting trees, and how many crayons are needed to color any map. Filled with a who's who of brilliant mathematicians who questioned, refined, and contributed to a remarkable theorem's development, Euler's Gem will fascinate every mathematics enthusiast.

    note = "The authors of First Concepts of Topology demonstrate the power, the flavor and the adaptability of topology, one of the youngest branches of mathematics, in proving so-called existence theorems. An existence theorem asserts that a solution to some given problem exists; thus it assures those who hunt for a solution that their labors may not be in vain. Since existence theorems are frequently basic to the structure of a mathematical subject, the applications of topology to the proofs of these theorems are frequently basic to the structure of a mathematical subject, the applications of topology to the proofs of these theorems constitute a unifying force for large areas of mathematics. In Part I of this monograph an existence theorem governing a large class of one-dimensional problems is treated; all the important ingredients in its proof, such as continuity of functions, compactness and connectedness of point sets, are developed and illustrated. In Part II, its two-dimensional analogue is carefully built via the necessary generalizations of the one-dimensional tools and concepts. The results are applied to such fundamental mathematical objects as zeros of polynomials, fixed points of mappings, and singularities of vector fields. The reader will find that each of the new concepts he masters will prove to be of invaluable help in his mathematical progress, especially in understanding the basis of the calculus. -- from back cover.

Physical heuristics have provided inspiration for new mathematical definitions (such as that of Gromov-Witten invariants) leading in turn to the solution of problems in enumerative geometry. Conversely, the availability of mathematically rigorous definitions and theorems has benefited the physics research by providing the required evidence in fields where experimental testing seems problematic. The aim of this volume, a result of the CIME Summer School held in Cetraro, Italy, in 2005, is to cover part of the most recent and interesting findings in this subject.

This class of spaces is important, since (using ideas borrowed from `Monstrous Moonshine') it is possible to give a bundle-theoretic definition of EU-(BG).

This very active subject has connections to algebraic topology, theoretical physics, number theory and algebraic geometry, and all these connections are represented in the sixteen papers in this volume. A variety of distinct perspectives are offered, with topics including equivariant complex elliptic cohomology, the physics of M-theory, the modular characteristics of vertex operator algebras, and higher chromatic analogues of elliptic cohomology. This is the first collection of papers on elliptic cohomology in almost twenty years and gives a broad picture of the state of the art in this important field of mathematics.

Nothing more than first courses in linear algebra and multivariate calculus are required, and the most direct and straightforward approach is used at all times. Numerous diagrams illustrate both the ideas in the text and the examples of curves and surfaces discussed there.The second edition has extra exercises with solutions available to lecturers online.

It is a jewel of mathematical exposition, judiciously picking exactly the right mixture of detail and generality to display the richness within. The text is mostly self-contained, requiring only undergraduate analysis and linear algebra. By relying on a unifying idea--transversality--the authors are able to avoid the use of big machinery or ad hoc techniques to establish the main results. In this way, they present intelligent treatments of important theorems, such as the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, the Poincaré-Hopf index theorem, and Stokes theorem. The book has a wealth of exercises of various types. Some are routine explorations of the main material. In others, the students are guided step-by-step through proofs of fundamental results, such as the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem. An exercise section in Chapter 4 leads the student through a construction of de Rham cohomology and a proof of its homotopy invariance. The book is suitable for either an introductory graduate course or an advanced undergraduate course.

Discussion covers elliptic curves as complex tori and as algebraic curves; modular curves as Riemann surfaces and as algebraic curves; Hecke operators and Atkin-Lehner theory; Hecke eigenforms and their arithmetic properties; the Jacobians of modular curves and the Abelian varieties associated to Hecke eigenforms. As it presents these ideas, the book states the Modularity Theorem in various forms, relating them to each other and touching on their applications to number theory. The authors assume no background in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. Exercises are included.

    note = ". . . both Gauss and lesser mathematicians may be justified in rejoic ing that there is one science [number theory] at any rate, and that their own, whose very remoteness from ordinary human activities should keep it gentle and clean. - G. H. Hardy, A Mathematician's Apology, 1940 G. H. Hardy would have been surprised and probably displeased with the increasing interest in number theory for application to {"}ordinary human activities{"} such as information transmission (error-correcting codes) and cryptography (secret codes). Less than a half-century after Hardy wrote the words quoted above, it is no longer inconceivable (though it hasn't happened yet) that the N. S. A. (the agency for U. S. government work on cryptography) will demand prior review and clearance before publication of theoretical research papers on certain types of number theory. In part it is the dramatic increase in computer power and sophistica tion that has influenced some of the questions being studied by number theorists, giving rise to a new branch of the subject, called {"}computational number theory. {"} This book presumes almost no background in algebra or number the ory. Its purpose is to introduce the reader to arithmetic topics, both ancient and very modern, which have been at the center of interest in applications, especially in cryptography. For this reason we take an algorithmic approach, emphasizing estimates of the efficiency of the techniques that arise from the theory.

It has thus become essential for workers in many scientific fields to have some familiarity with the subject. The authors have tried to be as comprehensive as possible, dealing in a unified manner with, for example, graph theory, extremal problems, designs, colorings and codes. The depth and breadth of the coverage make the book a unique guide to the whole of the subject.

The common thread is the existence of a linear space with a topology or two (or more). Here the paths diverge in the choice of how that topology is defined and in whether to study the geometry of the linear space, or the linear operators on the space, or both. In this book I have tried to follow the common thread rather than any special topic. I have included some topics that a few years ago might have been thought of as specialized but which impress me as interesting and basic. Near the end of this work I gave into my natural temptation and included some operator theory that, though basic for operator theory, might be considered specialized by some functional analysts.

The first part of the book contains chapters on arithmetic, elementary and analytic geometry, algebra, differential and integral calculus, functions of complex variables, integral transforms, ordinary and partial differential equations, special functions, and probability theory. The second part discusses molecular physics and thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, oscillations and waves, optics, special relativity, quantum mechanics, atomic and nuclear physics, and elementary particles. The third part covers dimensional analysis and similarity, mechanics of point masses and rigid bodies, strength of materials, hydrodynamics, mass and heat transfer, electrical engineering, and methods for constructing empirical and engineering formulas. The main text offers a concise, coherent survey of the most important definitions, formulas, equations, methods, theorems, and laws. Numerous examples throughout and references at the end of each chapter provide readers with a better understanding of the topics and methods. Additional issues of interest can be found in the remarks. For ease of reading, the supplement at the back of the book provides several long mathematical tables, including indefinite and definite integrals, direct and inverse integral transforms, and exact solutions of differential equations.

    note = "Since the publication of its first edition, this book has served as one of the few available on the classical Adams spectral sequence, and is the best account on the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. This new edition has been updated in many places, especially the final chapter, which has been completely rewritten with an eye toward future research in the field. It remains the definitive reference on the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The first three chapters introduce the homotopy groups of spheres and take the reader from the classical results in the field though the computational aspects of the classical Adams spectral sequence and its modifications, which are the main tools topologists have to investigate the homotopy groups of spheres. Nowadays, the most efficient tools are the Brown-Peterson theory, the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, and the chromatic spectral sequence, a device for analyzing the global structure of the stable homotopy groups of spheres and relating them to the cohomology of the Morava stabilizer groups. These topics are described in detail in Chapters 4 to 6. The revamped Chapter 7 is the computational payoff of the book, yielding a lot of information about the stable homotopy group of spheres. Appendices follow, giving self-contained accounts of the theory of formal group laws and the homological algebra associated with Hopf algebras and Hopf algebroids. The book is intended for anyone wishing to study computational stable homotopy theory. It is accessible to graduate students with a knowledge of algebraic topology and recommended to anyone wishing to venture into the frontiers of the subject.

Many exercises illustrate and sharpen the theory and extended exercises give the reader an active part in complementing the material presented in the text. One novel feature is a chapter devoted to a quick but thorough treatment of Grobner basis theory and the constructive methods in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry that flow from it. Applications of the theory and even suggestions for computer algebra projects are included. This book will appeal to readers from beginners to advanced students of commutative algebra or algebraic geometry. To help beginners, the essential ideals from algebraic geometry are treated from scratch. Appendices on homological algebra, multilinear algebra and several other useful topics help to make the book relatively self- contained. Novel results and presentations are scattered throughout the text.

Although assuming few mathematical pre-requisites, the standard of mathematical rigour is not compromised. The material covered includes the standard core of categories; functors; natural transformations; equivalence; limits and colimits; functor categories; representables; Yoneda's lemma; adjoints; monads. An extra topic of cartesian closed categories and the lambda-calculus is also provided - a must for computer scientists, logicians and linguists! 
This Second Edition contains numerous revisions to the original text, including expanding the exposition, revising and elaborating the proofs, providing additional diagrams, correcting typographical errors and, finally, adding an entirely new section on monoidal categories. Nearly a hundred new exercises have also been added, many with solutions, to make the book more useful as a course text and for self-study.

Starting from the foundations, this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality. The book then turns to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representations of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits. These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterized by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions. This second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including two new chapters on topics of active interest. One is on symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories and the coherence theorems for them. The second describes 2-categories and the higher dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence. The bibliography has also been expanded to cover some of the many other recent advances concerning categories.

Its easy-to-read treatment offers an intuitive approach, featuring informal discussions followed by thematically arranged exercises. Intended for undergraduate courses in abstract algebra, it is suitable for junior- and senior-level math majors and future math teachers. This second edition features additional exercises to improve student familiarity with applications. An introductory chapter traces concepts of abstract algebra from their historical roots. Succeeding chapters avoid the conventional format of definition-theorem-proof-corollary-example; instead, they take the form of a discussion with students, focusing on explanations and offering motivation. Each chapter rests upon a central theme, usually a specific application or use. The author provides elementary background as needed and discusses standard topics in their usual order. He introduces many advanced and peripheral subjects in the plentiful exercises, which are accompanied by ample instruction and commentary and offer a wide range of experiences to students at different levels of ability.

The authors introduce chapters by indicating why the material is important and, at the same time, relating the new material to things from the students background and linking the subject matter of the chapter to the broader picture.Instructors will find the latest edition pitched at a suitable level of difficulty and will appreciate its gradual increase in the level of sophistication as the student progresses through the book. Rather than inserting superficial applications at the expense of important mathematical concepts, the Beachy and Blair solid, well-organized treatment motivates the subject with concrete problems from areas that students have previously encountered, namely, the integers and polynomials over the real numbers.Supplementary material for instructors and students available on the books Web site: www.math.niu.edu/{\char`\~}beachy/abstract\_algebra/

It is intended to be, as the title suggests, a first introduction to the subject. Even so, a few words are in order about the purposes of the book. Algebraic geometry has developed tremendously over the last century. During the 19th century, the subject was practiced on a relatively concrete, down-to-earth level; the main objects of study were projective varieties, and the techniques for the most part were grounded in geometric constructions. This approach flourished during the middle of the century and reached its culmination in the work of the Italian school around the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. Ultimately, the subject was pushed beyond the limits of its foundations: by the end of its period the Italian school had progressed to the point where the language and techniques of the subject could no longer serve to express or carry out the ideas of its best practitioners.

The combination of the author’s extensive knowledge of combinatorics and classical and practical tools from algebra will inspire motivated students to delve deeply into the fascinating interplay between algebra and combinatorics. Readers will be able to apply their newfound knowledge to mathematical, engineering, and business models. The text is primarily intended for use in a one-semester advanced undergraduate course in algebraic combinatorics, enumerative combinatorics, or graph theory. Prerequisites include a basic knowledge of linear algebra over a field, existence of finite fields, and group theory. The topics in each chapter build on one another and include extensive problem sets as well as hints to selected exercises. Key topics include walks on graphs, cubes and the Radon transform, the Matrix–Tree Theorem, and the Sperner property. There are also three appendices on purely enumerative aspects of combinatorics related to the chapter material: the RSK algorithm, plane partitions, and the enumeration of labeled trees. Richard Stanley is currently professor of Applied Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Stanley has received several awards including the George Polya Prize in applied combinatorics, the Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Leroy P. Steele Prize for mathematical exposition.

The four main chapters present the basic material of the subject: fundamental group and covering spaces, homology and cohomology, higher homotopy groups, and homotopy theory generally. The author emphasizes the geometric aspects of the subject, which helps students gain intuition. A unique feature of the book is the inclusion of many optional topics which are not usually part of a first course due to time constraints, and for which elementary expositions are sometimes hard to find. Among these are: Bockstein and transfer homomorphisms, direct and inverse limits, H-spaces and Hopf algebras, the Brown representability theorem, the James reduced product, the Dold-Thom theorem, and a full exposition of Steenrod squares and powers. Researchers will also welcome this aspect of the book.

A second feature consists of an emphasis on homological algebra: basic notions on complexes are presented as soon as modules have been introduced, and an extensive last chapter on homological algebra can form the basis for a follow-up introductory course on the subject. Approximately 1,000 exercises both provide adequate practice to consolidate the understanding of the main body of the text and offer the opportunity to explore many other topics, including applications to number theory and algebraic geometry. This will allow instructors to adapt the textbook to their specific choice of topics and provide the independent reader with a richer exposure to algebra. Many exercises include substantial hints, and navigation of the topics is facilitated by an extensive index and by hundreds of cross-references.

    note = "This is a graduate textbook covering an especially broad range of topics. The first part of the book contains a careful but rapid discussion of the basics of linear algebra, including vector spaces, linear transformations, quotient spaces, and isomorphism theorems. The author then proceeds to modules, emphasizing a comparison with vector spaces. A thorough discussion of inner product spaces, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and finite dimensional spectral theory follows, culminating in the finite dimensional spectral theorem for normal operators. The second part of the book is a collection of topics, including metric vector spaces, metric spaces, Hilbert spaces, tensor products, and affine geometry. The last chapter discusses the umbral calculus, an area of modern algebra with important applications. For the third edition, the author has: * added a new chapter on associative algebras that includes the well known characterizations of the finite-dimensional division algebras over the real field (a theorem of Frobenius) and over a finite field (Wedderburn's theorem); * polished and refined some arguments (such as the discussion of reflexivity, the rational canonical form, best approximations and the definitions of tensor products); * upgraded some proofs that were originally done only for finite-dimensional/rank cases; * added new theorems, including the spectral mapping theorem and a theorem to the effect that , dim(V)=dim(V*) with equality if and only if V is finite-dimensional;* corrected all known errors; * the reference section has been enlarged considerably, with over a hundred references to books on linear algebra. From the reviews of the second edition: {"}In this 2nd edition, the author has rewritten the entire book and has added more than 100 pages of new materials. ... As in the previous edition, the text is well written and gives a thorough discussion of many topics of linear algebra and related fields. ... the exercises are rewritten and expanded. ...

The goal is to rigorously present the fundamental concepts within the context of illuminating examples and stimulating exercises.

The continuity, differentiability, integrability, and power series representation properties of functions of a single variable are established. The next few chapters describe the topological and metric properties of Euclidean space. These are the basis of a rigorous treatment of differential calculus (including the Implicit Function Theorem and Lagrange Multipliers) for mappings between Euclidean spaces and integration for functions of several real variables. Special attention has been paid to the motivation for proofs. Selected topics, such as the Picard Existence Theorem for differential equations, have been included in such a way that selections may be made while preserving a fluid presentation of the essential material.

Frank Adams, the founder of stable homotopy theory, gave a lecture series at the University of Chicago in 1967, 1970, and 1971, the well-written notes of which are published in this classic in algebraic topology. The three series focused on Novikov's work on operations in complex cobordism, Quillen's work on formal groups and complex cobordism, and stable homotopy and generalized homology. Adams's exposition of the first two topics played a vital role in setting the stage for modern work on periodicity phenomena in stable homotopy theory. His exposition on the third topic occupies the bulk of the book and gives his definitive treatment of the Adams spectral sequence along with many detailed examples and calculations in KU-theory that help give a feel for the subject.

Over the last few years powerful new methods in analysis and topology have led to the development of the modern global theory of symplectic topology, including several striking and important results. At its publication in 1995, *Introduction to Symplectic Topology* was the first comprehensive introduction to the subject and it has since become an established text in this fast-developing branch of mathematics. This second edition has been significantly revised and expanded, with new references and additional examples and theorems. It includes a section on new developments and an expanded discussion of Taubes and Donaldson's recent results.

    note = "With firm foundations dating only from the 1950s, algebraic topology is a relatively young area of mathematics. There are very few textbooks that treat fundamental topics beyond a first course, and many topics now essential to the field are not treated in any textbook. J. Peter May’s A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology addresses the standard first course material, such as fundamental groups, covering spaces, the basics of homotopy theory, and homology and cohomology. In this sequel, May and his coauthor, Kathleen Ponto, cover topics that are essential for algebraic topologists and others interested in algebraic topology, but that are not treated in standard texts. They focus on the localization and completion of topological spaces, model categories, and Hopf algebras. The first half of the book sets out the basic theory of localization and completion of nilpotent spaces, using the most elementary treatment the authors know of. It makes no use of simplicial techniques or model categories, and it provides full details of other necessary preliminaries. With these topics as motivation, most of the second half of the book sets out the theory of model categories, which is the central organizing framework for homotopical algebra in general. Examples from topology and homological algebra are treated in parallel. A short last part develops the basic theory of bialgebras and Hopf algebras.

 *How to Be Less Stupid About Race* is your essential guide to breaking through the half-truths and ridiculous misconceptions that have thoroughly corrupted the way race is represented in the classroom, pop culture, media, and politics.

But in the midst of this reckoning, widespread denial and misunderstandings about race persist, even as white supremacy and racial injustice are more visible than ever before.  
Combining no-holds-barred social critique, humorous personal anecdotes, and analysis of the latest interdisciplinary scholarship on systemic racism, sociologist Crystal M. Fleming provides a fresh, accessible, and irreverent take on...

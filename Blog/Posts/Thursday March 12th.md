While hanging out with a few friends, we came up with a question that should have a clear direct answer: is the 2-sphere $S^2$ being a Lie group? If not, what is the obstruction?

My initial intuition here was something along these lines: if $S^2$ were a topological group, we could consider its Lie algebra by taking the tangent space at the identity $e$ (where without loss of generality, we can rotate $S^2$ to identify $e$ with the North pole.)

Now 

It turns out that the following is true:

Theorem
: $S^n$ is a topological group $\iff n=0,1,3$.

My impression was that this should be related to the fact that the only normed division algebras are $\RR, \CC, \HH$, and \OO$, but couldn't find an obvious proof along those lines. A bit of searching on Math StackExchange turned up the following proofs:



Proof
:

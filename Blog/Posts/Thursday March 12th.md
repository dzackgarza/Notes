While hanging out with a few friends, we came up with a question that should have a clear direct answer: is the 2-sphere $S^2$ being a Lie group? If not, what is the obstruction?

My initial intuition here was that the tangent space at every point should "look the same" in some sense

It turns out that the following is true:

Theorem
: $S^n$ is a topological group $\iff n=0,1,3$.

My impression was that this should be related to the fact that the only normed division algebras are $\RR, \CC, \HH$, and \OO$, but couldn't find an obvious proof along those lines. A bit of searching on Math StackExchange turned up the following proofs:



Proof
:

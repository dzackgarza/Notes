Cool fact: you can show the non-existence of Hopf invariant one elements in dimensions $1,2,4,8$ using K theory. 
The argument is pretty clean, and the paper is only 8 pages: <https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/adamatiy.pdf>

See Mosh-Tang for the original proof using cohomology operations: <https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/moshtang.pdf>.
This also apparently includes computations of cohomology of EM spaces.

Interesting question in arithmetic statistics: for $G \in \Grp$ finite, how many Galois extensions are there $K/\QQ$ with $G = \Gal(K/\QQ)$ and $\Delta \leq N$ for some fixed $N$?

\envlist

- For $G=\ZZ/2$, it is $O(N)$.
- For $G=\ZZ/3$, it is $O(\sqrt N )$.

One can ask a similar question about $\Cl(K)$ for $G\in \Ab$, or replacing $\QQ$ with function fields $\FF_q(t)$ for $q=p^n$, and ask questions about frequency of primes ramifying, splitting, or remaining inert.

Cool fact: there is an equivalence of categories between finitely-generated extensions $K/k$ with $\trdeg(K/k) = 1$ and regular projective curves $C_{/k}$.
The (reverse) functor is the one sending a curve $C$ to its function field $k(C)$.

Hurwitz spaces come up here!

## The Galois action on symplectic K-theory

> Reference: Tony Feng, "The Galois action on symplectic K-theory", EAKTS. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ulm8bCcuW2Q>

- Significance of higher $K$ groups:

![image_2021-04-29-13-18-09](figures/image_2021-04-29-13-18-09.png)

- Theorem and consequence of Quillen-Lichten: $K_{4i-2}(\ZZ) \tensor \ZZ_p \cong H^2_{\et}( \ZZ \invert{p}, \ZZ_p(2i))$.
  - Similar relationship between topological $K$ theory and singular cohomology
  - Related to $\zeta(1-2i)$ by the Iwasawa main conjecture (Mazur-Wiles)
  - Isomorphism to $H^2_\sing(X, \ZZ_p(2i)$where $X$ is an etale $K(\pi, 1)$ for $\pi \da \pi_1(\ZZ\invert{p})$ which is a quotient of $\Gal( \Qbar / \QQ)$.
  - Interpretation of local system/etale sheaf 

- This sheaf: $\ZZ_p(1) \da \underset{n}{\directlim}\, \mu_{p^n}$ and $\ZZ_p(i) \da \ZZ_p(1)^{\tensor i}$.

- Etale homotopy of $\OO_K$ for $K$ a global field: a punctured 3-manifold
- Interpret $H^1(\ZZ\invert{p}) = H^1_{\Grp}(\pi_1 G)$ for $G \da \ZZ\invert{p})$, also isomorphic to $\Ext^1_G$: space of 2-dimensional Galois representations

- For congruence subgroups \( \Gamma\leq \GL_2(\ZZ) \), there is a natural Galois action on $H^*( \Gamma, \ZZ_p)$.

- Langlands philosophy: all Galois representations are accounted for by the cohomology of arithmetic groups

- $\B \SP_{2g}(\ZZ)$ is the etale homotopy type of $\Ag$

- PPAV: a complex torus $\CC^g/ \Lambda$ with a polarization: symplectic form on the lattice with a positivity condition.
  Principal: perfect pairing.

  - Can recover \( \Lambda = H_1(A; \ZZ) \) 
  - Quotient Siegel half-space (contractible) by $\Sp_{2g}(\ZZ)$ to forget choice of basis for \( \Lambda \).
  Take stack quotient.

  - Free quotient of contractible space: homotopy type of $\B \SP_{2g}(\ZZ)$.

- Some coincidences:
\[
H_{\Grp}(\Sp_{2g}(\ZZ)) \pcomplete
\cong
H_\Sing (\HH_g / \Sp_{2g}(\ZZ))\pcomplete
\cong
H_\Sing(\Ag(\CC); \ZZ_p)
\cong 
H_\et (\Ag_{g, \CC}; \ZZ_p)
.\]

- Can define an algebraic stack $A_g$ over any $S\in \Sch$, classifying flat families of PPAVs.
  - Can write \( \mathcal{A}_{g, \CC} = \mathcal{A}_{g, \QQ} \fiberprod{\spec \QQ} \spec \CC    \) which has a natural action of $\Aut(\CC/\QQ)$ on the 2nd factor, which factors to $\Gal(\Qbar/\QQ)$.

  - Produces an action on $H_\et( \mathcal{A}_{g, \CC}; \ZZ_p)$.

- Classifying space of a category: geometric realization of the nerve.

- Constructing $K$ theory:

  ![image_2021-04-29-13-40-18](figures/image_2021-04-29-13-40-18.png)

- Can also do Quillen's plus construction: $K_i(\ZZ) = \pi_i( \B\GL_{\infty}(\ZZ)^+)$, which is stable homology?

- Original paper title: Galois action on stable *cohomology* of $\Ag$.
  Need $p\gg i$, otherwise proof had many issues.
  Passing to stable homotopy theory made things easier!

- Question: where are $\B \Gamma$ Shimura varieties?

- Lie groups are homotopy equivalent to their maximal compact subgroups

- Hodge map: came from taking the Hodge bundle and its Chern classes, where the fiber over every $A\in \Ag$ is $H^0(A, \Omega_A^1)$ the Hodge cohomology

- Galois action unramified except at $p$ implies it factors through $\pi_1 \ZZ\invert{p}$?

- Guessing the Galois action: trivial on the first factor, the cyclotomic character on the second

  ![image_2021-04-29-13-53-53](figures/image_2021-04-29-13-53-53.png)

- Room for extensions: the Galois action looks like the following, with a quotient in the bottom-right, a sub in the top-left, and a possible extension in the top-right:

  ![image_2021-04-29-13-54-39](figures/image_2021-04-29-13-54-39.png)

- Informal statement of main theorem:

  ![image_2021-04-29-13-55-03](figures/image_2021-04-29-13-55-03.png)

- Consider the category of extensions and find a universal object.

- $\spec \ZZ\invert{p}$: integers punctured at $p$

- What does it mean for an algebra to be *faithfully flat* over another algebra?

- p-adic Hilbert functor: see Bhatt-Lurie.

  - Use this to get "almost" results, then use prismatic techniques (where one has Frobenius) to remove the "almost".

- Extracting $p$th roots? 
  Passing from $k[g_1, \cdots, g_n]$ to $k[g_1^{1/p}, \cdots, g_n^{1/p}]$, I think...

- F-pure and strongly F-regular singularities are characteristic $p$ analogs of log-canonical and log-terminal singularities in the minimal model program.

- Tilting: pass from mixed characteristic to characteristic $p$.
  Try to use simpler proofs/theorems from characteristic $p$ situation.

  - Going forward: some limiting process after inverting $p$..?
    Going backward: take Witt vectors.
    

- What properties of schemes descend along faithfully flat morphism? See EGA.
  However, what properties descend for the $\fpqc$ topology?

  - What is a faithfully flat morphism?

- See Faltings' *almost purity* theorem.

- Commutative algebra: see excellent regular domains, integral vs algebraic closures.
  Cohen-Macauly rings and modules

- Can have $\fpqc$ coverings that are not $\fppf$ coverings.

- What is a *regular* scheme?

  - Theorem: any finite covering of a regular scheme is an $\fpqc$ covering

  - Very nontrivial in characteristic zero.

  - Noether normalization can show some finite coverings of $\AA^3_{/k}$ are not $\fppf$ coverings.

- Sometimes local or coherent cohomology classes

- Grothendieck's descent: faithfully flat implies something is an equivalence.

## Class groups and Galois representations

> Reference: Ribet, "Class Groups and Galois Representations". <https://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/herbrand.pdf>

- Alternate definition of class group: the group of fractional idea.s
  Defined as $\ZZ[\mspec \OO_K]$ (the free $\ZZ\dash$module on maximal ideals) modulo principal fractional ideals

- What *is* the maximal unramified extension, i.e. the Hilbert class field?

- The Artin map from CFT: $\Cl(K) \mapsvia{\sim} \Gal(H/K)$ where $\mfp \mapsto \Frob_{\mfp}$.

- Set $G_k \da \Gal(\Qbar/K)$, then $\Cl(K)$ is a quotient of $G_k^{\Ab}$.

  - Equivalently, $\Cl(K)\dual \leq G_k\dual$ where $(\wait)\dual \da \Hom_{\Top\Grp}(\wait, \CC\units)$.
  I.e. take continuous characters.

- Open question: are there infinitely many quadratic fields $K$ for which $\Cl(K) = 0$

- Dedekind zeta function:
\[
\zeta_K \da \prod_{\mfp \in \mspec \OO_K}(1 - N(\mfp)^{-s} )\inv
.\]
  - Note: guessing about the indexing set here.
  Original source just indexes over $\mfp$...

  - $\Res_{s=1} \zeta_K$ involves $h_k \da \# \Cl(K)$.

- Serre stresses: use functional equation to look at $s=0$ instead of $s=1$!
  Leads to cleaner/simpler formulas.

- Kummer proved FLT for exponent $p$ for **regular** primes, i.e. $\gcd(h_K, p) = 1$.
  - Kummer's criterion: $p$ is regular iff $p$ divides none of the numerators of some Bernoulli numbers.

- What is the Teichmüller character?

- BSD conjecture: define the Tate-Shafarevich group as $\Sha(E/\QQ)$ for an elliptic curve, then
\[
\# \Sha(E/\QQ) \underset{?}{=} \qty{ L(E, 1) \over \Omega} \qty{ \#(E(\QQ))^2 \over \prod_\ell w_\ell}
,\]
  where \( \Omega \) is a period and \( w_\ell \) are the local Tamagawa numbers.

- Need lower bounds of sizes of class groups.
  Might be able to use elliptic curves, congruences between Eisenstein series and cusp forms on $\operatorname{U}(2, 2)$ -- can obtain 4-dimensional Galois representations that lead to nontrivial elements of $\Sha$.

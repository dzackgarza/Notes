- Some big conjectures in AG/NT:
  - The Ash Conjecture:
    Galois representations coming from torsion cohomology classes of locally symmetric spaces.
  - Deligne's weight monodromy conjecture:
    Something to do with complete intersections.
- What's the deal with prismatic cohomology?
  - Something coming from Bhatt: an integral version of $p\dash$adic Hodge theory which is supposed to link a bunch of other cohomology theories.

- What is a Dirichlet character?
- A Dirichlet character is equivalent to a group homomorphism
\[
\chi:(\mathbb{Z} / N)^{\times} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{\times}
.\]
- What is a Dirichlet $L\dash$function?
  - Definition of a Dirichlet $L\dash$function:
  \[
  L(s ; \chi):=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\chi(n)}{n^{s}}
  =
  =\prod_{p}\left(1-\chi(p) p^{-s}\right)^{-1}
  .\]

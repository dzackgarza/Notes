- One can take etale cohomology of varieties, and later refine to schemes, and thus take it for the base field even when it's not algebraically closed and extract arithmetically interesting information.

- Prismatic cohomology: meant to relate a number of other cohomology theories

- Prism: a pair $(A, I)$ where $A$ is a commutative ring with a derived Frobenius lift $\phi:A\to A$, i.e. a $\delta\dash$structure.
  - $I \normal A$ is an ideal defining a Cartier divisor.

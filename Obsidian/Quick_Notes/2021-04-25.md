## Fukaya Category

Description of a certain wrapped [Fukaya category](Fukaya%20category) $\OO$: take the objects to be (Lagrangian) embedded curves, the morphisms are the graded abelian groups $\hom_\OO \definedas \qty{\bigoplus_{L_0 \transverse L_1} \ZZ/2\ZZ, \bd}$ wher $\bd$ is given by counting holomorphic strips, localize along small isotopies.


## Notes from Eisenbud

Add to Algebra qual review doc #todo

An ideal $\mfp$ is prime iff $JK \subset \mfp \implies J \subset \mfp$ or $K\subset \mfp$.

A ring is a domain iff the ideal $(0)$ is prime.

> Inductively, if $\mfp$ contains a product of ideals then it contains one of them.

Maximal ideals are prime, since $\mm$ maximal implies that $R/\mm$ is a field.

A ring is *local* iff it has a unique maximal ideal $\mm$.

An element $e$ is idempotent iff $e^2 = e$.

An $R\dash$algebra $S$ is a ring $S$ and a homomorphism $\alpha:R \to S$.

Every ring is a $\ZZ\dash$algebra in a unique way.

The most interesting commutative algebras are $S/I$ where $S = k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ for $k$ a field, $\ZZ$, or the localization of a ring at a prime ideal.

## The representation ring

Tags: #idle_thoughts

- The [representation ring](representation%20ring) $R(G)$: the free \(\ZZ\dash\)module on isomorphism classes of irreducible [representations](../zettelkasten/representation%20theory.md).

  - How can we construct this using modern [groupoid](groupoid) yoga? 
  Take the category \( \modsleft{G} \), somehow restrict to just [irreducibles](irreducibles).
  Maybe there's a better thing to do here though, like "ignoring" reducibles the same way John Carlson "ignored" projectives.
  But okay, anyway, take that category. 
  Take its [nerve](nerve) and then the [geometric realization](geometric%20realization) and then $\pi_0$ or something?
  And then take the free \(\ZZ\dash\)module.
  I definitely need to ask some homotopy theorists how this construction goes for usual [../zettelkasten/K-Theory](../zettelkasten/K-Theory.md) in modern terms.
  So like...
  \[
  \ZZ \left[ \pi_0 \abs{ N \cat{C} } \right]
  .\]
  The $\pi_0$ should be taking isomorphism classes somehow, but maybe this only works for groupoids?
  But okay, whatever, I just need a functor that takes categories into spaces where two objects end up in the same path component iff they're isomorphic in $\cat{C}$. 
  So maybe this needs to be something more [simplicial](Simplicial%20set).

Description of a certain wrapped Fukaya category $\OO$: take the objects to be (Lagrangian) embedded curves, the morphisms are the graded abelian groups $\hom_\OO \definedas \qty{\bigoplus_{L_0 \transverse L_1} \ZZ/2\ZZ, \bd}$ wher $\bd$ is given by counting holomorphic strips, localize along small isotopies.



## Notes from Eisenbud

An ideal $\pr$ is prime iff $JK \subset \pr \implies J \subset \pr$ or $K\subset \pr$.

A ring is a domain iff the ideal $(0)$ is prime.

> Inductively, if $\pr$ contains a product of ideals then it contains one of them.

Maximal ideals are prime, since $\mm$ maximal implies that $R/\mm$ is a field.

A ring is *local* iff it has a unique maximal ideal $\mm$.

An element $e$ is idempotent iff $e^2 = e$.

An $R\dash$algebra $S$ is a ring $S$ and a homomorphism $\alpha:R \to S$.

Every ring is a $\ZZ\dash$algebra in a unique way.

The most interesting commutative algebras are $S/I$ where $S = k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ for $k$ a field, $\ZZ$, or the localization of a ring at a prime ideal.

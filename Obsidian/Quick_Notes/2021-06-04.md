- Problem: for many QFTs, we don't know how to write down the quantum observables $\mcf(U)$ for an open $U \subseteq X$ (e.g. for $X$ spacetime).
- Three approaches:
  - Factorizable cosheaves (topological/differential geometric)
  - Vertex algebras (algebra and analysis)
  - Chircal/factorization algebras

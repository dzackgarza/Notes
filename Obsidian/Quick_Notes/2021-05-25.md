- Brauer groups, Azumaya algebras
  - This is some $H^2$ perhaps? Like $\Br(X) = H^2(X; \GG_m)$?
    Need to figure out what kind of cohomology this is though.
- Brauer-Manin pairing, Tate pairing
- degree of cycles on Chow
- central fiber, formal schemes
  - There is a sensible way to define Brauer groups for formal schemes as a holim
- $\lim^1$
- See GAGA principle

- Modular forms can be defined as functions $\HH\to \CC$ satisfying weak $\Gamma\dash$invariance.
- Also sections of a bundle: the modular curve.
- Weights refer to growth rates of these functions
- A weight $k$ modular form is an element of $H^0(X; \omega^{\tensor k})$ where $X$ is the compactified modular curve, a quotient of $H \union \PP^1(\QQ)$
  - This definition extends to $H/\Gamma$

- Weird fact: $M_1$ is one-dimensional, but for $g\geq 2$ we have $\dim M_g = 3g-3$

  - Special things for $g=1$: $\qdash$expansions (i.e. Fourier seres), vanishing Torelli, $\pi_1 \TT$ for the torus is abelian, the $\theta$ function has a discrete zero locus, infinite product expansions like Jacobi's triple product

- Higher genus generalizations come not from a Teichm√ºller cover $T_g \surjects M_g$ or $M_g$, no one seems to care about those though.
  - People do care about Siegel modular forms: replace $\HH$ with $\HH_S^g$ the symmetric $g\times g$ matrices with positive-definite imaginary part

- $\HH_S^g/\Sp(2g; \ZZ)$ is somehow a model for PPAVs, $M_g$ embeds as a variety since we have Jacobians.

- Hodge bundle: rank $g$ over $M_g$, fibers over isomorphism classes are $H^0(X, K_X)$ where $K$ is the canonical, then take the determinant bundle.


  - Surprisingly, $\HH_S^g$ is a Lie group but not a Lie algebra: $[AB]^t = -[BA]^t$, so it's not closed.

## Gromov-Witten Invariants in Derived AG 

My main question: does introducing derived stacks somehow make *some* computation easier??
I haven't found any explicit computations of these, but sources alluded to actual counts (numbers) conjecturally coming from physics, where a few have been verified.

Why care about coherent sheaves?

- Donaldson-Thomas invariants are supposed to relate to Gromov-Witten invariants:

## Derived Stacks 

- We can't prove the Tate conjecture?
  I guess this is an arithmetic analog of the Hodge conjecture. 
  Serre's book calls some isomorphism the Tate conjecture and says it's proved though.

- Pithy explanation of a derived scheme: a space which can be covered by Zariski opens $Y\cong \spec A^*$ where $A\in \cdga_{k}$.

  - Schemes and stacks can be very singular. 
  Derived schemes/stacks act a bit like smooth, nonsingular objects.
  Morphisms behave like they are transverse?

- Derived modular stacks of coherent sheaves over $X$ remember the entire deformation theory of sheaves on $X$.
  - The homology of its "tangent space" at a point $[E]$ is $\Ext^*(E, E)$, which only holds in restricted degrees if you only use a non-derived moduli scheme or stack.

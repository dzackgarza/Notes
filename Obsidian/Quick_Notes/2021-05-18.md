- Want to study homology cobordism groups of 3-manifolds $\Theta_\ZZ^3$.
  - We don't understand the torsion in this group.
  - Reduce to study of a group of "$\iota$ complexes".
  - Theorem: it has a $\ZZ^{\infty}$ summand.

- See [[Seifert fibered spaces]].

- People like HF because there are a lot of computation tools!
  In particular, a surgery formula.

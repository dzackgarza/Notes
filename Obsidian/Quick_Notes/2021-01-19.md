- What is [the canonical bundle](../zettelkasten/Canonical%20bundle.md)?
- What is the [Tautological bundle](Tautological%20bundle)?
 	 Is this the *same* as the canonical bundle?
- How does one define $\OO(1)$? [O(1)](../zettelkasten/O(D)%20for%20D%20a%20divisor.md)
- Tensoring differential forms: $\omega^{\tensor k}$.
  What algebraic things does this live in? How do you write it in local coordinates?

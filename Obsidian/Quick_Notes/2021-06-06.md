- Context: the infinity category of spaces, i.e. homotopy types
- Take smooth manifolds, take the Yoneda embedding to $\Psh(\sm\Mfd)$: these satisfy a Mayer-Vietoris gluing property, and homotopy invariance in the sense that $\Hom(\wait, X) \cong \Hom(\wait \cross I, X)$
  - Why the first argument: homotopy invariance *as a presheaf*

- AG setting: $\Psh(\sm\Sch_{/k})$, send to presheaves to define **motivic spaces**.
  - Satisfies a Nisnevich gluing condition and $\AA^1$ invariance
  Similar homotopy invariance: $F(\AA^1 \cross X)\cong F(X)$.

- See Betti realization for $k=\CC$: $\sm\Sch_{/\CC}\to \Spaces$ where $X\mapsto X(\CC)$.

- From topology: identify $\B \U_n(\CC) = \Gr_n(\CC)$ to get rank $\Vect_{/\CC}^{n}(U) \cong \pi_0 \Maps(U, \B \U_n(\CC))$.


- Problem in AG: there are two rank 2 vector bundles on $\PP^1 \cross \AA^1$ whose fibers over 0 and 1 are $\OO^2$ and $\OO(1) \oplus \OO(-1)$.

- Theorem: for $U$ smooth affine $\kSch$, there is an equivalence of rank $n$ vector bundles on $U$ mod equivalence to $\pi_0 \Maps_{\Spc(k)}(U, \B \GL_n)$ where again $\B\GL_n \cong \Gr_n$.
  - Would like this for non-smooth non-affine schemes?

- Algebraic K theory: finitely generated projective \(R\dash\)modules mod equivalence with $\oplus$, then take group completion to get $K_0(R)$.
  - $K_0(k) \cong \NN^\gp \cong \ZZ$.
- To get a space: take $K(R) \da \Proj(\rmod)^\gp$ to get a space, set $K_i R \da \pi_i K(R)$

- Prop: the $K$ theory space here is a motivic space, $K: \sm\Sch_{/k}\op \to \Spaces$.

- Interesting fact: $\Loop^\infty \SS \cong (\Finset, \disjoint)^\gp$.


- Note from Yuri Sulyma:
"B is [widespread but] really bad notation for geometric realization. You should think of B as part of an equivalence B: {monoidal categories} -> {pointed connected (2-)categories}. Up to the Quillen equivalence {Kan complexes} ~= {spaces}, geometric realization takes a (quasi-)category (or simplicial set) and inverts all the morphisms.

So $M^\gp = \Omega\realize{\B M}$: you take $M$, deloop to turn the objects into morphisms, invert all the morphisms, then take loops to get your objects back."


- Theorem (Morel-Voevodsky): $X\in \sm\kSch$
\[
K(X) \cong \Maps_{\Spaces(k)}(X, \ZZ \cross \Gr_\infty)
.\]

- Uses stratification of $\Gr$ by affines, thanks Schubert calculus!

## Stanford AG: Samir Canning, joint with Hannah Larson

- What is the universal curve over $M_g$?

- What is the tautological ring, and how does it relate to the Chow ring?

- What are the $\kappa$ classes?

- Question: when does $A^*(M_g) = R^*(M_g)$?

- The integral Chow ring is *very* unknown. We know it only very recently for $M_2, \bar{M_2}$. Compare to rational Chow rings: we know them as quotients of polynomial rings for $M_g, g\leq 23$.

- Can stratify $M_g$ by gonality.

- What are hyperelliptic curves?

  > I definitely have known this at several points in time, yeesh.

- Look at Hurwitz space: moduli spaces of degree $n$ covers of $\PP^1$ by smooth genus $g$ curves? At least this specific one is.

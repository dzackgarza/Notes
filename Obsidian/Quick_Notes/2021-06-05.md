- $(\infty, 2)$ category: discrete set of objects, enriched in categories, $2\dash$morphisms are strictly associative?
- $(\infty, n)$ categories: all $n+k\dash$morphisms are invertible.
- There is an embedding $n\Cat$ into $(\infty, n)\dash\Cat$with a specific model structure.
- Model structure on $\sSet$: fibrant objects are Kan complexes, there is a Quillen equivalence between $\Top$ and $\sSet$
- $\inftycat{\infty, 1}$: enriched in $\inftygpd$
  - Quasicategory: lifting property with lifting against inner horns

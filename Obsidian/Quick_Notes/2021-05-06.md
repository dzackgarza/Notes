- [[Algebraic de Rham complex]]:
![image_2021-05-06-11-15-55](figures/image_2021-05-06-11-15-55.png)

- Can get a derived version: take *non-abelian derived functors*, i.e. take a [[simplicial resolution]] by simplicial polynomial algebras and apply the functor to the resolution.
  - Equivalently a [[left Kan extension]]?
- Define $\Ld \Omega^1 _{A/R}$ to be the [[cotangent complex]] and take derived exterior powers for the other degrees.
- Derived [[Hodge filtration]] may not be complete, so take completion: take cone (cofiber?) in derived category and take a hocolim.

- Fact: de Rham complex has a universal property, initial (strictly, so odd elements square to zero) commutative [[DGA]] receiving a map $A\to X^0$, so the initial way to turn an algebra into a DGA.
  Does the derived version have a similar property?

- $\HH(A/R) \da A^{\tensor_R S^1}$ the $S^1$ tensoring, take homotopy fixed points to get $\HC^-$.
- Associated graded of $\HH$ recovers derived de Rham:

  - Why does this happen? $\HH(A/R)$ is the initial [[simplicial algebra | simplicial $R\dash$algebra]] with an $S^1\dash$action receiving a map from $A$.
  - Analogies
    - Simplicial ring $\mapstofrom$ [[CDGAs]]
    - $S^1$ action $\mapstofrom$ the differential

- Can take homotopy groups of $\HH$????

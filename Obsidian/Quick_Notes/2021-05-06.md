- [[Algebraic de Rham complex]]:
![image_2021-05-06-11-15-55](figures/image_2021-05-06-11-15-55.png)

- Can get a derived version: take *non-abelian derived functors*, i.e. take a [[simplicial resolution]] by simplicial polynomial algebras and apply the functor to the resolution.
  - Equivalently a [[left Kan extension]]?
- Define $\Ld \Omega^1 _{A/R}$ to be the [[cotangent complex]] and take derived exterior powers for the other degrees.
- Derived [[Hodge filtration]] may not be complete, so take completion: take cone (cofiber?) in derived category and take a hocolim.

- Fact: de Rham complex has a universal property, initial (strictly, so odd elements square to zero) commutative [[DGA]] receiving a map $A\to X^0$, so the initial way to turn an algebra into a DGA.
  Does the derived version have a similar property?

- $\HH(A/R) \da A^{\tensor_R S^1}$ the $S^1$ tensoring, take homotopy fixed points to get $\HC^-$.
- Associated graded of $\HH$ recovers derived de Rham:

![image_2021-05-06-11-25-44](figures/image_2021-05-06-11-25-44.png)

  - Why does this happen? $\HH(A/R)$ is the initial [[simplicial algebra | simplicial $R\dash$algebra]] with an $S^1\dash$action receiving a map from $A$.
  - Analogies
    - Simplicial ring $\mapstofrom$ [[CDGAs]]
    - $S^1$ action $\mapstofrom$ the differential

- Can take homotopy groups of $\HH$????

- Some relevant things about [[Morava K-theory]]:
![Tate construction and homotopy orbits/fixed points in the norm map](figures/image_2021-05-06-13-11-30.png)

- Produce a virtual fundamental class for flow categories.
  Moduli spaces of trajectories appearing will be "derived orbifolds".

  - Use some derived/spectral version of the usual Novikov ring?

- Flow category:
![image_2021-05-06-13-15-11](figures/image_2021-05-06-13-15-11.png)

  - Enriched in spaces
  - Use a so-called *Kuranishi flow category*.
  - Use [[ambidexterity]], some kind of Poincar√© duality for orbifolds

- Where do flow categories come from?
  One natural source: Morse functions.
  Objects are critical points, morphisms are roughly trajectories.

- Given a functor $\cat{C} \to \Sp$ out of a flow category, can construct a spectrum as a $\hocolim$.
  Turns Floer data into stable homotopy data?

- Defining a flow category:

![image_2021-05-06-13-18-44](figures/image_2021-05-06-13-18-44.png)

  - Morphisms are moduli spaces of Floer trajectories, i.e. flow lines using the symplectic form?

  - Action map $A: P\to \RR$ given by integration, objects of $P$ form a poset.

  - Action induces a filtration $P_{ \lambda} \da \ts{ p\in P \st A(p) < \lambda}$.

  - Get filtered modules, need to work with a completion of this filtration.
    Tough to build/describe, uses point-set language and zigzags.
    Maybe easier in infty-categorical language?

- Get an $E_2$ ring spectrum -- not great! 
  But there is an Ore condition that makes things nicer.

- Can express enrichments in terms of [[lax functors]] from an indexing 2-category
  - Cats of objects of set type $S$ and morphism type $V$ are lax functors from some indiscrete indexing 2-category (associated to $S$?) to a bicategory associated to $V$.

- How does one construct the [[virtual fundamental class]]?
  Under orientability hypothesis, have some kind of Alexander duality.

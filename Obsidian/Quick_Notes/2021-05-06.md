Algebraic de Rham cohomology:

Can get a derived version: take *non-abelian derived functors*, i.e. take a simplicial resolution by simplicial polynomial algebras and apply the functor to the resolution.
Define $\Ld \Omega^1 _{A/R}$ to be the cotangent complex and take derived exterior powers for the other degrees.
- Derived Hodge filtration may not be complete, so take completion: take cone (cofiber?) in derived category and take a hocolim.

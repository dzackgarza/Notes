- Goal: look at moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces and equip it with a symplectic structure using the Weil-Petersson form.
  - Interesting because polynomials involving volumes compute intersection numbers on $\mgn$.

- Curves with marked points = punctured Riemann surfaces = punctured surfaces with complete constant curvature Riemannian metrics.
  Almost all admit a hyperbolic metric.

- $\mgn(\vector L)$: moduli of hyperbolic surfaces with $n$ geodesic boundary components with lengths prescribed by $L_i$, up to boundary-label-preserving isometries.

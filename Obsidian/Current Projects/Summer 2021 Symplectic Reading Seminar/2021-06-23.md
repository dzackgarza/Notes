# Outline
Recommended approach: 3,4,9,10,11.

1. ?
2. Regularity
3. Transversality
	(Recommended, but I skipped 3.4)
4. Compactification and Bubbling
5. More bubbling
	Only look at 5.1 and 5.2.
	Main results are 5.2.1, 5.3.1, skip the rest
6. ?
7. Defining $\GW_{\mathrm{A}_k}^M$?
	See 7.1, add marked points in 7.3.
	Count ration curves in $\PP^n$ in 7.4.
	Needed to understand applications in chapter 9.
8. ?
9. Applications.
	Need background from 7.1.

# Overview

- Idea: count solutions to a non-linear elliptic PDE

Goal: define [Gromov-Witten invariants](Gromov-Witten%20invariants) for genus 0 curves and some restricted classes of symplectic manifolds, particularly 4-manifolds
- Bubbling
	- See Ch.4, Ch.5
	- How is energy measured, and how do we deal with [bubbling](bubbling)
- Needs a $\Spinc$ structure?
- [Donaldson invariant](Donaldson%20invariant): difficult to work with due to compactness issues.
	Easier in [Seiberg-Witten](../../Unsorted/Seiberg–Witten%20invariants.md) since the moduli space (up to gauge transformation) is compact

## Applications
Of SW:

- Kronheimer/Mrowka: proved the [Thom conjecture](Thom%20conjecture): for $\CP^2$, a holomorphic curve is genus-minimizing among curves that represent homology classes
- - Morgan, Szabo, and Taubes to prove that a smooth symplectic curve of nonnegative self-intersection in a symplectic four-manifold is genus minimizing
- Computable for Kahler manifolds, allowing enumeration of algebraic curves.

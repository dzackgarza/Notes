Variety: an integral separated scheme of finite type over $k$.
Dimension: dimension as a Noetherian topological space.
Curve: a complete (proper over $k$) variety of dimension 1.
Singular: for $\mfm \normal \OO_{X, x}$ the maximal ideal of the local ring at a closed point $x$, $X$ is singular if $\dim_{\kappa(x)} \mfm/\mfm^2 \neq 1$

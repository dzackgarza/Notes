> The connections between [Formal group laws](Formal%20group.md) and [homotopy](chromatic%20homotopy%20theory.md) are key. Read Quillen's paper, J.F. Adams' blue book, Ravenel, etc. Ravenel has some slides on Quillen's work (good entry pt). If you really want to go in depth, I enjoyed learning from Hazewinkel's book "Formal Groups and Applications".

- Commutative Group Laws, [Lazard's Theorem](Lazard's%20Theorem). See:
  - *Stable homotopy and generalised homology* 
  - *A. FrÂ¨ohlich, Formal groups*

  - Why are they important?

# Notes

- Def: ?

- From Tyler Genao: for $(R, \mfm)$ is a complete [local ring](local%20ring), can plug $\mfm$ into a formal group law to construct a group whose underlying set is $\mfm$
	- Makes the power series converge.

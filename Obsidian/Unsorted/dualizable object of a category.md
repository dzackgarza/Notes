For $(X, \tensor, \one)$ a [[monoidal category]], right duals: existence of two morphisms
\[
\eps: X\dual \tensor X &\to \one &&\text{evaluation} \\
\eta: \one &\to X\tensor X\dual &&\text{coevaluation}
,\]
along with some diagram.

Objects admitting a left and right dual admit a [trace](trace%20(monoidal%20categories).md)

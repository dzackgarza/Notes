Here is a very fundamental way to create interesting Riemannian manifolds: Let $G$ be a [semisimple](semisimple%20category.md) Lie group, let $K$ be its maximal compact subgroup, let $\Gamma$ be a discrete subgroup of $G$, and form $G/K$. This quotient is called the [symmetric space](../Unsorted/symmetric%20space.md) attached to $G$.

The Riemannian structure comes from an invariant metric on $G$, and so $G$ acts as isometries on $G/K$ by left translation.

If you now take a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ of $G$, you can form the double quotient $\Gammaâˆ–G/K$. These are some of the most celebrated [Riemannian manifolds](Riemannian%20manifolds) in mathematics. In the case of $SL_2(\RR)$, we know via [uniformization](uniformization.md) that all genus $g\geq2$ [Riemann surfaces](Riemann%20surfaces) can be described in this way. In the case of $SL_2(\CC)$ we get [hyperbolic 3-manifolds](hyperbolic%203-manifolds), from symplectic groups we get [moduli stacks of abelian varieties](moduli%20stack%20of%20abelian%20varieties.md).

P.S. I should also note that the study of spaces $\dcoset{\Gamma}{G}{K}$ for certain $\Gamma$ (so-called [congruence subgroups](congruence%20subgroups)) is one of the basic topics of the [Langlands program](Langlands%20program), and the function theory and cohomology of these spaces (especially their representation-theoretic structure) is conjectured to govern a vast amount of number theory. Trying to understand and work on these conjectures was my own motivation for learning [Lie theory](Lie%20group.md).

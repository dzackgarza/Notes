Some notes on the Fargues-Fontaine curve.

- What do we mean by "curve" in general?
  Hartshorne defines a curve over $k=\kbar$ an an integral separated scheme of finite type over $k$ of dimension 1.
  - The curve is *algebraic* if it has pure Krull dimension 1, or equivalently has an affine open cover where $\spec R_i$ is Krull dimension 1.

- Why the FF "curve" isn't a curve: it's a scheme over $\QQpadic$, but not finite-type.

Constructing the curve:

### Method 1: Analytically

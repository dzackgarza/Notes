Some notes on the Fargues-Fontaine curve $X_{\ff}$, the fundamental curve of $p\dash$adic Hodge theory.

What's the point? 
There's supposed to be a "curve" $X_{\ff}$ over $\QQpadic$ where local Langlands for $\QQpadic$ should be encoded as geometric Langlands on $X_{\ff}$.
Stems from conjectures of Grothendieck wanting to related de Rham cohomology to etale cohomology.
Loose analogy: $\CC[z]$ as a $\CC\dash$algebra consists of regular (polynomial) functions on $\PP^1(\CC)$ with a pole at $\infty$ of order equal to the degree of the polynomial. 
View the $\ZZ\dash$algebra $\ZZ$ as the regular functions on $P$ the set of primes (finite places), with a point at $\infty$ (infinite place) given by the usual valuation $\abs{\wait}$.
Make this more algebro-geometric by replacing $\ZZ$ with either $\ZZpadic$ or $\QQpadic$ and looking at $\QQpadic\dash$algebras $B$ as a replacement for regular functions.
$X_\ff$ is also roughly a moduli of untilts, which allow passing between $\FF_p$ and $\QQpadic$.
A major goal is to go from characteristic zero to characteristic $p$ (relatively easy) and then to go back to characteristic zero (relatively hard).
The curve is useful because many linear algebraic objects of $p\dash$adic theory can be translated into vector bundles over $\Xff$, and there is "Grothendieck splitting" type of theorem for those.


### Definitions

- *Curve*: over $k=\kbar$, an integral separated scheme of finite type over $k$ of dimension 1.
- *Algebraic curve*: pure Krull dimension 1, or equivalently has an affine open cover where $\spec R_i$ is Krull dimension 1.
  - For (irreducible) varieties over $k=\kbar$, just an algebraic variety of dimension 1.
- *Complete curve*: for algebraic varieties $X$, universally closed: the projections $X\cross (\wait)\to(\wait)$ are closed maps when evaluated on any variety.
  Equivalently, $X\to k$ is a proper morphism (separated, finite type, and universally closed)
  - For topological spaces, $X$ is compact iff $X$ is complete.
  - Complete (smooth) varieties of dimension 1 are always projective.
- *Completely valued field*: a field $k$ equipped with a valuation $v:K \to \RR_{\geq 0}$ which is complete as a metric space with respect to $v$.
- *Valuation ring*: defined as $\OO_K \da \ts{x\in K \st v(x) \leq 1}$, the unit disc with respect to the valuation.
  - Has a unique maximal ideal, the interior of the disc: $\mfm \da \OO_K\sm ts{v(x) = 1}$.
- *Dedekind scheme*: a Noetherian integral scheme of dimension 1 where every local ring is regular.
  - Example: $\spec R$ for $R$ a Dedekind domain.
  - Slogan: any non-generic point is a closed point.
- *Tilts*: for $k$ a field, denoted $k^\tilt \da \inverselim (k\mapsvia{x\mapsto x^p} k \mapsvia{x\mapsto x^p} k \cdots)$, realized as certain sequences, made into a characteristic $p$ field with pointwise multiplication and a $p\dash$twisted addition law involving limits.
  Equipped with a valuation and a valuation ring.
- *Untilts*: For $k$ a field, a pair $(K, \iota)$ where $\iota: k\mapsvia{\sim} K^\tilt$ is an isomorphism of fields, plus a condition on valuation rings $\OO_k$ and $\OO_K^\tilt$.
- *Formal schemes*: topologically ringed spaces $(X, \OO_X)$ where $\OO_X$ is a sheaf of topological rings, which is locally a formal spectrum of a Noetherian ring.
  - *Formal spectrum*: $\Spf R \da \Spf_I R = \colim_{n} \Spec R/I^n$, where $I^n$ is a system of ideals forming neighborhoods of zero in the sense that if $U\ni 0$ then $I^n \subseteq U$ for some $n$. 
    Take the colimit in $\Top\Ringedspace$.
    The structure sheaf of $\Spf_I R$ is $\colim_{n} \OO_{\spec R/I^n}$
  - These are meant to accommodate formal power series as regular functions.
  - Examples: $I\normal R$, take the $I\dash$adic topology with basic open sets $r + I^n$.
    Then $\realize{\Spf A} = \realize{\Spec A/I} \in \Top$
- *Formal disk*: an infinitesimal thickening of a point.
- *Punctured formal disk*: remove the unique global point from a formal disk.
- *adic space*: the analytic space associated to a variety over a nonarchimedean field, e.g. $\QQpadic$.

### Main Results

- Why care about tilts/untilts: for $k$ a field and $X\da \spec \QQ$ as a scheme, characteristic zero tilts of $k$ are a good replacement for $X(k)$ which makes $X\cross X$ nontrivial.

- Main theorem: if $k = \kbar$ is a completely valued characteristic $p$ field, then there exists a Dedekind scheme $X \to \spec \QQpadic$ whose closed points $x$ (or rather their local rings $\OO_{X, x}$) yield (isomorphism classes) of characteristic 0 untilts of $k$, modulo the action of the Frobenius $\phi(x) = x^p$.
  - So moduli of untilts of a perfectoid field, behaves like open disc in $\CC$.
  The unique characteristic $p$ untilt is like $z=0 \in \CC$.

- Why the FF "curve" isn't a curve: it's a scheme over $\QQpadic$, but not finite-type: specifically, the structure morphism $X\to \spec \QQpadic$ is not finite type (on affines: $\spec A\to \spec B$ induces $B\to A$ making $A \in \modsleft{B}$ finitely generated).
  -Why not finite type? Since if $x\in X$ is a closed point then the residue field $\kappa(x) / \QQpadic$ is not a finite extension.
  - Incidentally, $\kappa(x)$ is exactly the untilt of $k$ corresponding to $x$.

- Nice properties of $X_{\ff}$ coinciding with curves:
  - $\sum \deg_x(f) = 0$ for every .rational function $f$ on $X_{\ff}$, similar to being projective/complete
  - Line bundles are classified by degree
  - $H^1(C, \OO_C) = 0$, similar to having genus $g=0$
  - $X\to \spec \QQpadic$ has simply connected fibers

- Suppose to geometrize period rings from $p\dash$adic Hodge theory.

Constructing the curve:


### Method 1: Analytically

- Punchline: $X_{\ff} = \Proj\qty{\bigoplus_{n\geq 0} B^{\phi = p^n}}$ as a scheme.

- $B^{\phi = p^n}$ are the elements in $B$ where $\phi(x) = p^n x$ where $\phi$ is the Frobenius.
- $B \da \colim_{I\subseteq [0, 1] \subset \RR} B_{I}$ is a $p\dash$adic Frechet space
  - Supposed to look like holomorphic functions of $p$.

- For $I\da [a, b]$, $B_{[a, b]}$ is the completion of $W(\OO_C^\tilt)\adjoin{{1\over p}, {1\over \abs \pi }}$ with respect to Gauss norms, where $W$ denotes the Witt vectors, and we've localized at $p$ and a pseudo-uniformizer.


### Method 2: Informal

Glue together *period rings*: an affine scheme to a formal disk along a formal punctured disc
\[
X_{\ff} = \spec B_{\cris}^{\varphi = 1} \glue{\spec B_{\dR }} \spec B_{\dR}^+
.\]

- $\spec B_{\cris}^{\phi = 1}$ is an affine scheme.
- $\spec B_{\dR^+}$ is a formal disk.
- $\spec B_{\dR}$ is a formal punctured disk.

- $B_\dR$ is a period ring, cooked up to relate $H^*_\dR(Y)$ to $H^*_{\et}(Y_{\bar K}; \QQpadic)$ when $Y$ is the generic fiber of a scheme over $W(k)$ and $Y_{\bar K} \da Y \fiberprod{\spec K} \spec \bar K$ (see *Crystalline comparison conjecture*).
- $B_\dR^+$ is its valuation ring (or place), i.e. a subring such that for every element $x$ of $\ff(B_{\dR})$, either $x \in B_{\dR}^+$ or $x\inv \in B_{\dR}^+$.
  It is non-canonically isomorphic to the $p\dash$adic Laurent field $\CC_p((t))$.


- This is supposed to look like building the Riemann sphere $\PP^1(\CC)$ as $\CC[z]$ (regular away from $\infty)$ glued to $\CC\dqty{1\over z}$ (germs of meromorphic functions at $\infty$).
  - Here $B_{\crys}^{\phi = 1}$ is supposed to look like $\CC[z]$ and $B_\dR$ is like $\CC\dqty{1\over z}$.

## Other Random Notes

> Good resource: [Morrow's article](http://www.bourbaki.ens.fr/TEXTES/Exp1150-Morrow.pdf)

- Much like $\PP^1(\CC)$, we have a Grothendieck splitting principle: every vector bundle $\mce \to \X_{\ff}$ splits uniquely as $\mce \cong \bigoplus_{k=1}^m \OO_{X_{\ff}}(\lambda _k)$ where $\lambda_k \in \QQ$ are weakly decreasing and $\OO_{\Xff}(\lambda)$ is a (somewhat complicated) rational twist.
  - Proof uses $p\dash$divisible groups, can be used to answer questions in $p\dash$adic Hodge theory (e.g. about Galois representations).
- Needs Scholze's theory of diamonds: Weil's proof of RH for curves uses the surface $X\fp{\FF_q} X$ for $X$ a curve (this surface is also used in shtuka theory in geometric Langlands), need a similar object in arithmetic geometry that should morally look like $\ZZ \tensor_{\FF_1} \ZZ$.

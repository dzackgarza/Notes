Some notes on the Fargues-Fontaine curve.

### Definitions

- *Curve*: over $k=\kbar$, an integral separated scheme of finite type over $k$ of dimension 1.
- *Algebraic curve*: pure Krull dimension 1, or equivalently has an affine open cover where $\spec R_i$ is Krull dimension 1.
  - For varieties, just an algebraic variety of dimension 1.
- *Complete curve*: ?

### Main Results

- Main theorem: if $k = \kbar$ is a completely valued characteristic $p$ field, then there exists a Dedekind scheme $X \to \spec \QQpadic$ whose closed points are (isomorphism classes) of characteristic 0 untilts of $k$, modulo the action of the Frobenius $\phi(x) = x^p$.

- Why the FF "curve" isn't a curve: it's a scheme over $\QQpadic$, but not finite-type: specifically, the structure morphism $X\to \spec \QQpadic$ is not finite type, since if $x\in X$ is a closed point then the residue field $\kappa(x) / \QQpadic$ is not a finite extension.
  - Incidentally, $\kappa(x)$ is exactly the untilt of $k$ corresponding to $x$.

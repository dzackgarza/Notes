- A [homology sphere](homology%20sphere.md) $X$ is any manifold $X\in \ZHS^n$, and the Poincare homology sphere is a [spherical](spherical%20manifold.md) [3-manifold](3-manifold.md) and is the only $X\in \ZHS^n$ with finite $\pi_1$.

- Its [fundamental group](fundamental%20group) is order 120
- Proves that there exist $X\ni \ZHS^n$ where $X\not\cong_\Top S^n$.

- Constructions:
	- Glue faces of a dodecahedron
	- $\SO_3(\RR)/I$, for $I\cong A_5$ the symmetries of an isocashedron

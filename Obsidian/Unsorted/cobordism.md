# Motivation

- Can I find a list of all manifolds up to diffeomorphism? No. 
- Weaken to homeomorphism? Still no. 
- Weaken to [[homotopy equivalence]]. Still pretty much no. 
- A really weak notion: [[cobordism]].

There is a sequence of spaces, $\MO(n)$, and maps $\Sigma \MO(n)\to \MO(n+1)$ such that the $k$th stable homotopy groups of this spectrum are isomorphic to the [cobordism group](cobordism%20group) of $k$-manifolds under disjoint union.  If you require your manifolds to be [stably framed](stable%20framing.md) you get the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]].

> Note: bordism is one of the coarsest equivalence relations we can put on manifolds. Hope to understand completely!

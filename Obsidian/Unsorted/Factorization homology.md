Factorization homology has received a considerable amount of interest recently, in large part due to its connection to topological field theories and to configuration space models for mapping spaces.
Factorization homology then forms an important class of topological field theories: the ones in which the global observables are determined by the local observables.
it can be modeled using labeled configuration spaces; in fact, it originates from configuration space models for mapping spaces,

See [[Dold-Thom theorem]]

Descriptions of the factorization homology of free En-algebras and of En-enveloping algebras of Lie algebras are known; see Section 5 of \[5\] and Section 3 of \[33\]. Suspension spectra provide another class of algebras for which factorization homology is known. This follows from non-abelian Poincar´e duality, which provides a description of the factorization homology of n-fold loop spaces in terms of mapping spaces or section spaces.

 For $M = S^1$ , factorization homology specializes to [topological Hochschild homology](topological%20Hochschild%20homology.md).

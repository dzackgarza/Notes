 I think the whole field of [anabelian geometry](anabelian%20geometry) fits the bill, even if it's perhaps more focused on going the other way around (i.e. applying homotopy theory to number theory). Anabelian geometry is a 'program' launched by Grothendieck in his famous Esquisse d'un Programme, and is all about translating arithmetic geometric problems to problems in [homotopy](Subjects/homotopy%20theory.md) theory.

 As an example of a specific instance of the anabelian philosophy, we have Grothendieck's celebrated **section conjecture**, which states (in one form) that for a 'nice' curve X over a [number field](number%20field) F, the [rational points](rational%20points) are in bijection with the sections of the exact sequence
$$
1 \rightarrow \pi_1(X_{\bar{F}}) \rightarrow \pi_1(X) \rightarrow G_F \rightarrow 1
$$
where $GF$ is the [absolute Galois group](absolute%20Galois%20group) of F and Ï€1 is the algebraic (etale) fundamental group. In case the curve is over the complex numbers, the [etale fundamental group](etale%20fundamental%20group) is the [profinite completion](profinite%20completion) of the regular fundamental group, so there is a very close connection to the classical stuff of Hatcher. 

The conjecture is still a wide [open problem](open%20problem), but any proof would mean you could check something of number theoretic interest (existence of [rational points](rational%20points) on [curves](curves.md)) by studying maps between certain generalized homotopy groups!

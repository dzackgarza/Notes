# General Notes

The standard Serre fibration: $\Omega X \into PX \mapsvia{f} X$ where $\Omega X$ is the loop space, $PX$ is the path space, and $f$ is the "evaluation at the endpoint" map. Note that $PX$ is contractible!

Consider a SES $0 \into A \into B \into C \into C$, then look at it as a 2-step filtration of $B$ so $F^0B = B, F^1B = A, F^2B = 0$. The graded pieces are $G_0 = C, G_1 = A$. Can use this to obtain LES from SS.

Homology in the ring-theoretic setting: If $R$ is a Noetherian ring and $I \subseteq R$, then if $I$ can be generated by $n$ elements then $H_I^i(M) = 0$ for any $R$-module $M$ and $i > n$. Thus to prove $I$ can *not* be generated by $n$ elements, it suffices to find a module $M$ where $H_I^{n+1} \neq 0$.


## Other Reading

Lots of good examples of computations [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serre_spectral_sequence)

Some fibrations

- Hopf: $S^1 \into S^3 \into S^2$
- $S^1 \into S^{2n+1} \into \CP^n$
- Path space: $\Omega S^n \into PS^n \into S^n$



Serre Spectral Sequence Example:
For the fibration $S^1 \into S^3 \into S^2$, the $E_2$ page:
\[
\begin{align*}
1 && H^0(S^2, \ZZ) && H^1(S^2, \ZZ) && H^2(S^2, \ZZ) \\
0  && H^0(S^2, \ZZ) && H^1(S^2, \ZZ) && H^2(S^2, \ZZ) \\
\hline
 && 0 && 1 && 2
.\end{align*}
\]

Which is equal to
\[
\begin{align*}
1  & H^0(S^2, \ZZ)   && 0 && H^2(S^2, \ZZ) \\
0  & H^0(S^2, \ZZ)   && 0 && H^2(S^2, \ZZ) \\
\hline
 && 0 && 1 && 2
.\end{align*}
\]


And $E_3 = E_\infty$, so $d_2^{0,1}$ is an isomorphism.

*Note: Probably a good starting point for basic calculations? Fill out the missing details for this table.*

Challenge: Prove $\pi_4(S^2) = \frac{\ZZ}{2\ZZ}$

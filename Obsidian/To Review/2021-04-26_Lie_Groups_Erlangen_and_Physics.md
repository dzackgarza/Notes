The universal compact lie group is the topological monoid $L(\RR^\infty, \RR^\infty)$ of linear isometric self-embeddings.

[Justification for Lie Group Computations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group#Lie_groups)
Here is a very fundamental way to create interesting Riemannian manifolds: Let $G$ be a semi-simple Lie group, let $K$ be its maximal compact subgroup, let $\Gamma$ be a discrete subgroup of $G$, and form $G/K$. This quotient is called the [symmetric space](../Unsorted/symmetric%20space.md) attached to $G$.

The Riemannian structure comes from an invariant metric on $G$, and so $G$ acts as isometries on $G/K$ by left translation.

If you now take a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ of $G$, you can form the double quotient $\Gammaâˆ–G/K$. These are some of the most celebrated [Riemannian manifolds](Riemannian%20manifolds) in mathematics. In the case of $SL_2(\RR)$, we know via uniformization that all genus $g\geq2$ Riemann surfaces can be described in this way. In the case of $SL_2(\CC)$ we get hyperbolic 3-manifolds, from symplectic groups we get moduli spaces of abelian varieties.

P.S. I should also note that the study of spaces $\dcoset{\Gamma}{G}{K}$ for certain $\Gamma$ (so-called [congruence subgroups](congruence%20subgroups)) is one of the basic topics of the [Langlands program](Langlands%20program), and the function theory and cohomology of these spaces (especially their representation-theoretic structure) is conjectured to govern a vast amount of number theory. Trying to understand and work on these conjectures was my own motivation for learning Lie theory.



- Irreducible reps of $\SO_3$ describe the periodic table
- Irreducible reps of $\SU_2$ lead to Dirac equations of the electron
- Standard Model: $\SU_3 \cross \SU_2 \cross \U_1$

$\SO(n)$ and its relativistic analog $\SO(1,n)$ define symmetries of space time. $\SU(n)$ defines fundamental quantum mechanical phase space symmetries. $\Sp(n)$ defines symmetries in cases where there is a quaternionic structure.

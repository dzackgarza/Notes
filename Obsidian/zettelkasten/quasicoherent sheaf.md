- A Noetherian [scheme](scheme.md) $X$ can be reconstructed from $\QCoh(X)$, see Gabriel 1962.
	- Idea: associate to an [abelian](Abelian%20category.md) category $\cat{A} \in \Ab\Cat$ a [ringed space](ringed%20space.md) $\spec \cat{A}$ and show $X \cong_{\Ringedspace} \QCoh(\spec \cat{A})$
- A smooth variety $X$ can *not* generally be reconstructed from its [derived category](derived%20category.md) $\D^b \QCoh(X)$, it can if the [canonical](canonical%20bundle.md) bundle is [ample bundle](ample%20bundle)
- In 2002 Balmer has reconstructed a noetherian scheme
from its [tensor triangulated category](tensor%20triangulated%20category) of [perfect complexes](perfect%20complexes.md).

> The connections between [Formal group laws](../zettelkasten/Formal%20group.md) and [homotopy](Chromatic%20homotopy%20theory) are key. Read Quillen's paper, J.F. Adams' blue book, Ravenel, etc. Ravenel has some slides on Quillen's work (good entry pt). If you really want to go in depth, I enjoyed learning from Hazewinkel's book "Formal Groups and Applications".

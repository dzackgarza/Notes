# Why study $K$-theory?
Examples of results gleaned from the [K-Theory](K-Theory.md) approach include the [Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch](Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch) theorem, [Bott periodicity](Bott%20periodicity), the [Aatiyah-Singer Index Theorem](Aatiyah-Singer%20Index%20Theorem.md), and the [Adams operations](Adams%20operations).

It played a major role in the second proof of the Index Theorem (circa 1962).

Already in 1955, Jean-Pierre Serre had used the analogy of vector bundles with projective modules to formulate [Serre's conjecture on vector bundles](Serre's%20conjecture%20on%20vector%20bundles),

Geometrically
- Finitely generated projective modules $\mapstofrom$ vector bundles over $\AA^N$, 
- free modules $\mapstofrom$ trivial vector bundles. 
 
Affine space is topologically contractible, so It admits no non-trivial topological vector bundles. It also admits no non-trivial holomorphic vector bundles. Jean-Pierre Serre remarked that the corresponding question was not known for [algebraic vector bundles](algebraic%20vector%20bundles): 
> "It is not known whether there exist projective $A\dash$modules of [finite type](finite%20type.md) 

where $A = k[x_1, ..., x_n]$ is a polynomial ring over a field.

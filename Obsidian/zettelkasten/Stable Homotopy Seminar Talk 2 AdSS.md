- Big question: what is $[X, Y]\in \Ab$?
	Start by understanding its $p\dash$torsion.
- Apply the functor $H^*(\wait) := H^*(\wait; \FF_p)$ to get $\Hom_{\Vect_{/\FF_p}}(H^* X, H^* Y)$.
- Find extra module structure on this Hom: module over $\mca$ the Steenrod algebra
- Take derived functors to get $\Ext_{\mca}^*( H^*X, H^* Y)$.
- Original use by Adams: Hopf Invariant One. Which $\RR^n$ are division algebras?

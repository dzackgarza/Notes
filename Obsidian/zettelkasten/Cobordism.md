# Motivation

Suppose you're studying manifolds. The first question you might ask is: can I find a list of all manifolds up to [[diffeomorphism]]? The answer is no. So you weaken to [[homeomorphism]], and the answer is still no. So you weaken to [[homotopy equivalence]] and the answer is still pretty much no (though you're getting better), so finally you demand a really weak notion: [[Cobordism]].

There is a sequence of spaces, $\MO(n)$, and maps $\Sigma \MO(n)\to \MO(n+1)$ such that the $k$th stable homotopy groups of this spectrum are isomorphic to the [[cobordism group]] of $k$-manifolds under disjoint union.  If you require your manifolds to be [stably framed](stable%20framing.md) you get the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]].

> Note: bordism is one of the coarsest equivalence relations we can put on manifolds. Hope to understand completely!

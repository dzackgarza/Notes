 A 1-groupoid is the same as an ordinary groupoid, and a 0-groupoid is the same as a set
 An âˆž-groupoid is an [infinity category](infinity%20categories.md) in which all morphisms are invertible. Equivalently a space up to homotopy.
 Precisely a [Kan complex](Kan%20complex.md)
Play the role analogous to sets in classical category theory
	- Have homs that are again infinity groupoids.

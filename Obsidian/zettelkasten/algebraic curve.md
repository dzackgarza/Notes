# Notes

- Encode points on a smooth projective curve as valuations measuring orders of poles/zeros.
	- Bounded valuations: points on the variety
	- Unbounded: points "at infinity", like puncture points on a Riemann surface
- Compactifications are not unique. Example:
	- $\AA^2 \subseteq \PP^2$
	- $\AA^2 \subseteq (\PP^1)^{\times 2}$
	- But $\PP^2 \neq (\PP^1)^{\times 2}$!

The algebraic analogues of a compact [Riemann surface](Riemann%20surface) of genus g; smooth [proper](proper) complex algebraic curve of genus $g$.

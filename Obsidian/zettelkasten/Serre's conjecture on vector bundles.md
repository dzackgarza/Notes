 Statement: every finitely generated [projective module](projective%20module) over a [polynomial ring](polynomial%20ring) is [free](free);
 
For $k\in \Fields$, is every \( M\in \modsleft{\kxn}^\fg \) actually free?
	- True by Quillen-Suslin 76
	
	
- Open problem (Bass-Quillen): 
	- Is the pullback-induced map $\Vect_r(X) \to \Vect_r(X \cross \AA^n)$ a bijection?
	- Proved in special cases

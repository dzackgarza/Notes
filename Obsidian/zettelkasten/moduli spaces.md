Prototypical example of a moduli space: $\Gr_\CC(n, k)$. Apparently fundamental classes exist for closed subvarieties? Maybe just closed subvarieties of a moduli space.

In fact, it is possible to say a great deal about the moduli space purely in terms of the moduli functor, without even knowing the moduli space exists! For example, the tangent space can be computed by evaluating the moduli functor on the spectrum of the ring of dual numbers (

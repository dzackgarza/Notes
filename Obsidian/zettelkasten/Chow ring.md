# Paper on Chow Rings

- Reference: a recent result, [Chow Rings computed in 2005 for $\B\GL_n, \B\SL_n, \B\Sp_n, \B\O_n, \B\SO_n$](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0505560.pdf)

Cohomology for [classifying spaces](classifying%20space.md) of linear [algebraic groups](algebraic%20group.md) (equivalently compact Lie Groups) have an algebraic analog: Chow rings of the classifying spaces. For a finite abelian group, the chow ring is the [Symmetric algebra](Symmetric%20algebra) on the group of characters.

There is a map from the Chow ring back into cohomology, which in general fails surjectivity and injectivity. Tensoring this map with $\QQ$ creates an isomorphism, though. In this case, both have the ring structure of invariants under the [Weyl group](Weyl%20group) in the symmetric algebra of the ring of [characters](characters) of a [maximal torus](maximal%20torus). (Classical result, Leray and Borel.)

Chow rings have not been computed for $\PGL_n$. Need to know about [Chern class](Chern%20class), [Euler class](Euler%20class.md),

$A_*$ known for all $O_n$ and $SO_n$ for $n$ odd in 80s, general result for $SO_n$ 2004. $PGL_n$ case is much harder. Understood for $n=2$, since $\PGL_2 \cong SO_3$. Other bits that have been computed: $H^*(\B\PGL_3, \ZZ/3), H^*(\B\PGL_n, \ZZ_2)$ for $n = 2 \mod 4$ in 70s/80s, incomplete results for $H^*(\B\PGL_p, \ZZ_p)$ in 2003.

Term [equivariant](equivariant) pops up a lot, [symplectic form](symplectic%20form), [schemes](scheme.md), [stack](stack.md)

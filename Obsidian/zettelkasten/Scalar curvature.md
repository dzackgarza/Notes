- The scalar curvature represents the amount by which the volume of a small geodesic ball in a Riemannian manifold deviates from that of the standard ball in Euclidean space. In two dimensions, the scalar curvature is twice the [Gaussian curvature](Gaussian%20curvature)
- Defined as the metric trace of the [Ricci tensor](Ricci%20curvature.md):
$$
S = \tr_g \Ric
$$
- Can be expressed in terms of [Christoffel symbols](Christoffel%20symbols).
- Requires a [Riemannian metric](Riemannian%20metric) $g$.
- Big question: which smooth closed manifolds have metrics with positive scalar curvature?
	- A lot is known!
	- Gromov and Lawson: every simply connected [manifold](manifold) of dimension at least 5 which is not [spin](spin) has a [metric](Riemannian%20metric) with positive scalar curvature.
		- Uses an $\alpha$ invariant taking values in $\K O_n$ 
			- See [K-Theory](K-Theory.md), [alpha invariant](alpha%20invariant).
	- Dimensions 3 and 4: as a cconsequence of [Geometrization](Geometrization.md), a closed orientable 3-manifold has a metric with positive scalar curvature if and only if it is a connected sum of [spherical](aspherical%20space.md) 3-manifolds and copies of $S^2 \cross S^1$.
	- In dimension 4, positive scalar curvature has stronger implications than in higher dimensions using [Seiberg–Witten invariants](Seiberg–Witten%20invariants)
		-  If $X$ is a compact [Kähler](Kähler) manifold of complex dimension 2 which is not rational or ruled, then X (as a smooth 4-manifold) has no Riemannian metric with positive scalar curvature.[8]

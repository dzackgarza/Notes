- The scalar curvature represents the amount by which the volume of a small geodesic ball in a Riemannian manifold deviates from that of the standard ball in Euclidean space. In two dimensions, the scalar curvature is twice the [Gaussian curvature](Gaussian%20curvature)
- Defined as the metric trace of the [Ricci tensor](Ricci%20curvature.md):
$$
S = \tr_g \Ric
$$
- Can be expressed in terms of [Christoffel symbols](Christoffel%20symbols).
- Requires a [Riemannian metric](Riemannian%20metric) $g$.
- Gromov and Lawson: every simply connected manifold of dimension at least 5 which is not [spin](spin) has a [metric](Riemannian%20metric) with positive scalar curvature

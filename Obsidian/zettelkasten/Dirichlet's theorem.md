Dirichletâ€™s theorem states that for each integer $m > 1$ and each integer $a$ coprime to $m$, there are infinitely many primes $p \equiv a \mod m$

More is true: [Chebotarev density](Chebotarev%20density) tells us that for each modulus $m$ the primes are equidistributed among the residue classes of the integers $a$ coprime to $m$.

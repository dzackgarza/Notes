# Notes
- For a [ringed space](ringed%20space) $X \in \Ringedspace$, denoted by $\Pic(X)$, is the group of isomorphism classes of [invertible sheaves](invertible%20sheaves)  (or [line bundles](line%20bundle.md)) on $X$ with the tensor product.
- $\Pic \spec R = \Cl(R)$ is the [ideal class group](ideal%20class%20group) (???) for $R$ a [Dedekind domain](Dedekind%20domain)
- Globalizes the [ideal class group](ideal%20class%20group) of a [number field](number%20field).
- Alternatively, the Picard group can be defined as the [sheaf cohomology](sheaf%20cohomology) 
$$H^{1} (X,{\mathcal {O}}_{X}\units).$$
- Fits into a SES
$$
0\to \Pic^0(V) \to\Pic(V) \to \NS(V) \to 0
$$
where $\NS$ is the [Neron Severi](Neron%20Severi.md) group.
- When $V$ is a [curve](curves.md), $\Pic^0 V = \Jac V$ is the [Jacobian](Jacobian.md)

- Picard group of a manifold:

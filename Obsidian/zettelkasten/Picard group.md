- For $(X, \OO_X) \in \Top \cross \Sh(\Ring)$ , defined as $\Pic(X)$ the group of iso classes of invertible sheaves (or line bundles) on $X$ with the tensor product.
	- $\Pic \spec R = \Cl(R)$ for $R$ a [[Dedekind domain]]
- Globalizes the ideal class group of a number field.
- Alternatively the sheaf cohomology $H^1(X; \OO_X\units)$
- Fits into a SES
\[
0\to \Pic^0(V) \to\Pic(V) \to \NS(V) \to 0
\]
where $\NS$ is the [[Neron Severi]] group.
- When $V$ is a curve, $\Pic^0 V = \Jac V$ is the [[Jacobian]]

A separated morphism is a morphism $f$ such that the [fiber product](fiber%20product) of $f$ with itself along $f$ has its diagonal $\diagonal$ as a closed subscheme.

Given $X\in \Sch_{/S}$, the diagonal morphism $\Delta_X: X\to X \fiberprod{S} X$ is a [closed immersion](closed%20immersion), so $X \subseteq \Delta_X(X)$ is a closed subspace.

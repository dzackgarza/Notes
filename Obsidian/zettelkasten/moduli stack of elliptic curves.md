# Notes
The [moduli functor](moduli%20space.md) $\Mg$ is not representable in $\Sch$: if it were, then every isotrivial family of curves would be equivalent to a trivial family.
Counterexample to this: take the family
$$
X_t: \quad y^{2}=x^{3}+t, t \neq 0
$$
All fibers are abstractly isomorphic by computing the [j invariant](j%20invariant), as zero, but this is not a trivial family e.g. because the [monodromy](monodromy) action $\pi_1(\CC\units; 1)\actson H^1(X_1, \CC)$

It does admit a [coarse moduli space](coarse%20moduli%20space).

**Teichmüller space** is a cover of $M_g$?

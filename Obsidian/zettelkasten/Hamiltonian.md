**Definition (Hamiltonian)**:
A smooth function $H: M \to \RR$ will be referred to as an energy functional or a *Hamiltonian*.
If we have $H: M\cross I \to \RR$, we'll refer to this as a *time-dependent Hamiltonian*, i.e. the time slices $H_t: M \to \RR$ given by $H_t(p) = H(p, t)$ are Hamiltonians. ^1c3cf2

> *Remark:*
> If $(M, \omega)$ is a [symplectic manifold](symplectic.md), each $H_t: M \to I$ induces a unique vector field $X_{H_t}$ characterized by the property $\iota_{X_{H_t}}\omega = -dH_t$ where $\iota$ is the [interior product](interior%20product).

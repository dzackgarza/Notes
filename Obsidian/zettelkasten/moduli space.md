Prototypical example of a moduli space: the [Grassmannian](Grassmannian.md)  $\Gr_\CC(n, k)$.

Apparently a [fundamental class](fundamental%20class) exists for closed subvarieties? Maybe just closed subvarieties of a moduli space.

In fact, it is possible to say a great deal about the moduli space purely in terms of the moduli functor, without even knowing the moduli space exists! For example, the tangent space can be computed by evaluating the moduli functor on the spectrum of the ring of dual numbers.

- Projective moduli space: 
- Coarse moduli space
  - Somehow a nicer version of a stack where torsion in the automorphism groups aren't messing things up
- Fine moduli space: ?
- Separated moduli problem
- [[Flat family]]
- [[Hilbert scheme]]
- [[Hilbert polynomial]]
- Tangent space to a functor
- Cotangent complex
- [[Algebraic spaces]]

# Motivation

[Infinite loop spaces](Infinite%20loop%20space.md): When a space has the structure of a group we get extra structure on its homology groups, namely a product structure (called the [[Pontryagin product]]). In fact, we only need a weak notion of group: an [zettelkasten/H-space](zettelkasten/H-space.md) will do, i.e. a group up to homotopy

It turns out we get [homology operations](zettelkasten/Cohomology%20operations.md) if our space is associative 'up to [[coherent homotopy]].' You might ask what this means, and it turns out that it's equivalent to being the [[loop space]] of some other space. Being associative and commutative 'up to [[coherent homotopy]]'' buys you something more: you're an [Infinite loop space](Infinite%20loop%20space.md).

A profinite group is a topological group that is isomorphic to the inverse limit of discrete finite groups.[

Examples:

- The [p-adic integers](p-adic%20integers.md) 
- The [profinite integers](profinite%20integers)

Profinite completions

Given $G\in \Grp$ a related profinite group $\hat{G} \in \Grp$, the profinite completion of G.[3] It is defined as the inverse limit of the groups G/N, where N runs through the normal subgroups in G of finite index

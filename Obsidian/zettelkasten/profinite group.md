A profinite group is a topological group that is isomorphic to the inverse limit of discrete finite groups.[

Examples:

- The [p-adic integers](p-adic%20integers.md) 
- The [profinite integers](profinite%20integers)

Profinite completions

Given $G\in \Grp$ a related profinite group $\hat{G} \in \Grp$, the profinite completion of G. It is defined as the 
$$
\inverselim_{N\normal G} G/N
,$$ where N runs through the normal subgroups in G of finite index

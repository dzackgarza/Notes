[Stacks](stack.md)and orbifolds are concepts from algebraic geometry (respectively geometric topology) that allow us to talk about objects that locally look like the quotient of a smooth object by a group action, in a way that remembers information about the [isotropy group](isotropy%20group) of the action.  

Such 'stacky' objects can behave like smooth objects  even  if  the  underlying  spaces  have  singularities.   As  for  spaces,  manifolds, and [schemes](scheme.md), cohomology theories are important invariants also for stacks and orbifolds, and examples such as ordinary cohomology or [K-theory](K-Theory.md) lend themselves to generalization.  

Special cases of orbifolds are 'global quotients', often denoted $M/G$, for example for a smooth action of a compact [Lie group](Lie%20group) $G$ on a smooth manifold $M$.  In such examples, the orbifold cohomology of $M/G$ is supposed to be the $G$-equivariant cohomology of $M$.  

This suggests away to do orbifold cohomology theories by means of [equivariant stable homotopy theory](equivariant%20stable%20homotopy%20theory),via suitable [$G$-spectra](spectra.md).  However, since the group $G$ is not intrinsic and can vary, one needs [equivariant homology theories](equivariant%20homology) for all groups $G$, with some compatibility.  

[Global homotopy theory](Global%20homotopy%20theory) makes this idea precise.

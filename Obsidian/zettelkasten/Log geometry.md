- Origins: Fontaine-Illusie-Kato (Deligne, Faltings) in the late 80s, schemes/stacks/derived schemes plus additional derived ("log") structure.
	- Examples:
		- A pair $(X, D)$ of a smooth scheme/stack and $D$ a smooth divisor
		- Or $D$ a toroidal embedding, remembers the boundary $D$
			- [Etale locally](Etale%20locally) isomorphic to the embedding of a toric boundary
		- Think about this like ""$X$ with a marked point on the boundary"
- Logarithmic geometry generalizes [[toroidal]] geometry to non-smooth settings.

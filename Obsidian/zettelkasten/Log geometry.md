> Reference: Mattia Talpo: Kummer-Ã©tale additive invariants of log schemes. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-CXf24pE9Y>

- Origins: Fontaine-Illusie-Kato (Deligne, Faltings) in the late 80s, schemes/stacks/derived schemes plus additional derived ("log") structure.
	- Examples:
		- A pair $(X, D)$ of a smooth scheme/stack and $D$ a smooth divisor
		- Or $D$ a toroidal embedding, remembers the boundary $D$
			- [Etale locally](Etale%20locally) isomorphic to the embedding of a toric boundary
		- Think about this like ""$X$ with a marked point on the boundary"
	- How they arise: in characteristic zero, working with a non-compact scheme. Compactify, and use [Resolution of singularities](Resolution%20of%20singularities.md) to make the boundary nice. Working with the log scheme is like working on the compact space but remembering that you originally cared about the complement of the compactifying [divisor](divisor.md).
- Logarithmic geometry generalizes [[toroidal]] geometry to non-smooth settings.

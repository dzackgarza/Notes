Simplest exact solution: Schwarzchild

- $R_{ij} - \frac{1}{2}R g_{ij} + \Lambda g_{ij} = T_{ij}$
- $\Lambda < 0$ the cosomological constant introduced by Einstein in order to obtain non-expanding universe - but by evidence from Hubble, it is expanding (and accelerating)
- Nonzero implies that there is some nonzero energy everywhere, in every metric - used to account for "dark energy".
- The [stress-energy tensor](stress-energy%20tensor):
	- Can be written as a $4\times 4$ matrix, where the $i,j$ component denotes a "flow of $i$ momentum in the $j$ direction". Flow of $t$ along $t$ is energy, while the others are pressure (think of an ideal gas).
- English interpretation: drop a sphere full of particles; the rate of shrinkage of the sphere is proportional to its volume, energy density, and pressure in 3 spatial coordinates (so dense objects in small volumes generate gravity!).
- Postulated by Einstein, fixed by Hilbert

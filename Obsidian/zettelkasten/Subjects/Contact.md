**Definition (Contact Type):**
For $(W, \lambda)$ an exact symplectic manifold, a codimension 1 submanifold $Y \subset W$ is of *restricted contact-type* iff $X$ is transverse to $Y$, i.e. for every $p\in Y$, we have $X(p) \not\in T_p(Y)$.

We say $Y$ is of *contact type* iff there is a neighborhood $U \supset Y$ and a one-form $\lambda$ with $d\lambda = \restrictionof{\omega}{U}$ making $(U, \lambda)$ of restricted contact type.

> Remark:
>$(U, \lambda)$ is of restricted contact type iff $\restrictionof{\lambda}{U}$ is a contact form.

**Definition (Hypersurface of contact type):**
For $(X, \omega)$ a symplectic manifold, a hypersurface $\Sigma \injects X$ is of *contact-type* iff there is a contact form $\lambda$ such that $d\lambda = \restrictionof{\omega}{Y}$.

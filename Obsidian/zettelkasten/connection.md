- Connects nearby tangent spaces, so it permits tangent vector fields to be differentiated as if they were functions on the manifold with values in a fixed vector space $V$
- The main invariants of an affine connection are its torsion and its curvature
	- The torsion measures how closely the Lie bracket of vector fields can be recovered from the affine connection

Defined as
$$
\Gamma(\mathrm{T} M)^{\tensor 2} & \rightarrow \Gamma(\mathrm{T} M) \\(X, Y) & \mapsto \nabla_{X} Y 
$$

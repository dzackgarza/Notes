# Talbot Talk 2: Hiro

## Intro

- Assign to a symplectic manifold a Fukaya category
	- An $A_\infty$ category, slightly different than homotopy-theoretic notion
	- A dg category
	- A $\ZZ\dash$linear stable infty category
- Replace with a functor $\Fuk$ that takes a category of symplectic manifolds to a stable infty-category over $\ZZ$
- Analogies:
	- The "take modules" functor $(\Rings)^\op$ to stable infty cats over $\ZZ$, $R\mapsto \rmod$
	- $\Sch^\op$ to stable infty cats over $\ZZ$, $X\mapsto \D^b\Coh(X)$.
- Recent conjecture: for certain $M$, make an$\SS\dash$linear functor $\Fuk(\wait, \SS)$ where $\Fuk(M, \SS)$ is a stable infty category
	- Can get stable infty categories out of very geometric things: symplectic manifolds
	- Hope to get an equivalence of categories between some infty  category of symplectic manifolds and the infty category of stable infty categories

- Morse theory recap
	- Index: write $f$ locally as $\sum x_i^2 - \sum y_i^2$ and the number of negative components is the index of the critical point
- Weinstein manifolds and sectors: special types of symplectic manifolds obtained from handle attachment
- Defining a symplectic manifold:
	- $\omega^{\vee 2}$ defines a volume form, or use $v\mapsto \omega(v, \wait)$ is a non-degenerate 1-form, thinking of $\omega: TM \mapsvia{\sim} T\dual M$.
    - The latter definition is useful in derived geometry.
  - $d\omega = 0$, a flatness condition.
- The most important example: for $Q$ any smooth manifolf, $T\dual Q, dp \vee dq)$ is symplectic.

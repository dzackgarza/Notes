# Notes

- Functors $\Delta\op\to\Set$ where $\Delta \leq \Finset$ are totally ordered finite sets $[n] = \ts{0, 1, 2, \cdots, n}$ for all $n\geq 0$, with order-preserving set-maps.
	- I.e. presheaves on $\Delta$.
	- Morphisms are natural transformations.
- Used to define [quasicategory](quasicategory.md)

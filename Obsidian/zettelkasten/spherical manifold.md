Definition:
A 3-manifold of the form $M \cong S^3/\Gamma$ where $\pi_1(M) \cong \Gamma \leq \SO_4(\RR)$.

- If $\Gamma$ is finite cyclic, $M$ is a 3-dimensional [lens space](lens%20space)

- Elliptization conjecture (Perelman): All compact [3-manifolds](zets/3-manifold.md) with finite fundamental group are spherical.

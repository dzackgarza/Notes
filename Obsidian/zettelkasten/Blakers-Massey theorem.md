 
 - There is a theorem of Blakers and Massey, sometimes called [[homotopy excision]] which says the following:
	 - Even though taking homotopy groups does not take [cofiber sequences](cofiber%20sequence.md) to long exact sequences, it does do so in a certain range depending on the connectivity of the [cofiber sequences](cofiber%20sequence.md). 

		In particular, if we keep suspending the [cofiber sequences](cofiber%20sequence.md)  (in which case we're asking about stable homotopy groups) then this is the case. 

	Think about every time you make an argument in homology using the [[long exact sequence of a pair]], you can now make that argument with stable homotopy groups, or any other nice spectrum, etc.

# Week 1

## Topics:
- Subgroups
- Quotients
- The fundamental isomorphism theorems
- Cosets
- The index of a subgroup
- Cauchy's theorem
- Lagrange's theorem
- Definitions and properties of common special families of groups:
	- Cyclic groups $C_n$
	- Symmetric groups $S_n$
	- Alternating groups $A_n$
	- Dihedral groups $D_{n}$
	- Matrix groups $\GL_n(k), \Orth_n(k), \SL_n(k), \SO_n(k)$ 
- Finite groups of order $\# G \leq 20$

## Exercises

For everything that follows, assume $G$ is a finite group.

### Orders

- Prove Lagrange's theorem
- Prove that if $\# G$ is prime, then $G$ is cyclic
- Prove that for every $g\in G$, the order of $g$ divides the order of $G$.
- Prove that if $\# G = n$, then $g^n = e$ for every $g\in G$

### Cosets

- Let $H\leq G$ be a subgroup (not necessarily normal), and let $G/H$ denote the set of left cosets of $G$ by $H$.
  Prove that any two cosets $xH, yH\in G/H$ have the same cardinality.

- Prove the *fundamental theorem of cosets*: for $xH, yH\in G/H$,
$$
xH = yH \iff x\inv y\in H \iff y\inv x \in H
$$
- Suppose $\# G = pq$ with $p, q\geq 2$ prime, and let $H\leq G$ be a proper subgroup.
  Prove that $H$ must be cyclic.

- Let $s\in G$, and state the definition of the **centralizer** of $C_G(s)$ of $s$ in $G$.
  - Show that $C(s) \leq G$ is a subgroup.
  - Let \( \gens{ s } \subseteq C_G(s)  \), where \( \gens{ s }  \) is the subgroup of $G$ generated by $s$.
  - Prove that \( \gens{ s }\normal G  \) is in fact a **normal** subgroup.

- Let $H\leq G$ be a subgroup and $N\normal G$ be a normal subgroup.
  Show that $NH \leq G$ is a subgroup.

## Review Exercises 

For everything that follows, assume $G$ is a finite group.

### Orders

- Prove Lagrange's theorem
- Prove that if $\# G$ is prime, then $G$ is cyclic
- Prove that for every $g\in G$, the order of $g$ divides the order of $G$.
- Prove that if $\# G = n$, then $g^n = e$ for every $g\in G$

### Cosets

- Let $H\leq G$ be a subgroup (not necessarily normal), and let $G/H$ denote the set of left cosets of $G$ by $H$.
  Prove that any two cosets $xH, yH\in G/H$ have the same cardinality.

- Prove the *fundamental theorem of cosets*: for $xH, yH\in G/H$,
$$
xH = yH \iff x\inv y\in H \iff y\inv x \in H
$$
- Suppose $\# G = pq$ with $p, q\geq 2$ prime, and let $H\leq G$ be a proper subgroup.
  Prove that $H$ must be cyclic.

### Normal Subgroups

- Let $s\in G$, and state the definition of the **centralizer** of $C_G(s)$ of $s$ in $G$.
  - Show that $C(s) \leq G$ is a subgroup.
  - Let \( \gens{ s } \subseteq C_G(s)  \), where \( \gens{ s }  \) is the subgroup of $G$ generated by $s$.
  - Prove that \( \gens{ s }\normal G  \) is in fact a **normal** subgroup.

- Let $H\leq G$ be a subgroup and $N\normal G$ be a normal subgroup.
  Show that $NH \leq G$ is a subgroup.

- Let $G_1, G_2$ be groups and $H_2 \leq G_2$ a subgroup.
  Suppose $\phi: G_1\to G_2$ is a group morphism.

- Suppose $\phi: G_1 \to G_2$ is a group morphism.

  - Show that the image $\phi(G_1) \leq G_2$ is a subgroup of $G_2$
  - Show that the preimage $\phi\inv(H_2) \leq G_1$ is a subgroup of $G_1$, 
  - Show that the kernel $\ker \phi \normal G_1$ is a normal subgroup of $G_1$.
  - Prove that group morphisms *preserve coset structure* in the following sense:
  \[
  xH_1 = yH_1 \iff \phi(x)H_2 = \phi(y)H_2
  .\]
  - Prove the **first isomorphism theorem**: 
  $\phi$ is injective $\iff \ker \phi = \ts{ e_{G_1} }$.

### Symmetric Groups

- Let $\sigma = (4\, 2\, 1)(6\, 1\, 3\, 2) \in S_6$ in cycle notation.
  - Write $\sigma$ as a product of disjoint cycles.
  - Compute the order of $\sigma$.
    What is the general theorem about the order of cycles?
  - Determine if $\sigma$ is even or odd.
    What is the general theorem?

- Suppose $\phi: S_n \to G$ with $n$ even and $\# G = m$ odd.
  - Prove that if $\tau \in S_n$ is a transposition, then $\tau \in \ker \phi$.
  - Prove that in fact *every* $\sigma \in S_n$ satisfies $\sigma \in \ker \phi$, so $\phi$ is the trivial morphism.
  - Does this hold if $n$ is odd?

## Warmup Problems

- Prove that if $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic then $G$ is abelian.

- Classify all groups of order $p^2$.

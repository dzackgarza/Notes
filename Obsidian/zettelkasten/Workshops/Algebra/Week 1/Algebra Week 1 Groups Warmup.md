## Unsorted Questions

For everything that follows, assume $G$ is a finite group.

- $H\leq G$ denotes that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$.
- $\# G$ denotes the *order* of $G$.
- $e$ or $e_G$ denotes the identity element of $G$.
- Multiplicative notation is generally used everywhere to denote the (possibly noncommutative) binary operation

### Orders

- Prove Lagrange's theorem.
- Prove Cauchy's theorem.
- Prove that if $\# G$ is prime, then $G$ is cyclic
- Prove that for every $g\in G$, the order of $g$ divides the order of $G$.
- Prove that if $\# G = n$, then $g^n = e$ for every $g\in G$

### Cosets

- Let $H\leq G$ be a subgroup (not necessarily normal), and let $G/H$ denote the set of left cosets of $G$ by $H$.
  Prove that any two cosets $xH, yH\in G/H$ have the same cardinality.

- Prove the *fundamental theorem of cosets*: for $xH, yH\in G/H$,
$$
xH = yH \iff x\inv y\in H \iff y\inv x \in H
$$
- Suppose $\# G = pq$ with $p, q\geq 2$ prime, and let $H\leq G$ be a proper subgroup.
  Prove that $H$ must be cyclic.

### Normal Subgroups

- Let $s\in G$, and state the definition of the **centralizer** of $C_G(s)$ of $s$ in $G$.
  - Show that $C(s) \leq G$ is a subgroup.
  - Let \( \gens{ s } \subseteq C_G(s)  \), where \( \gens{ s }  \) is the subgroup of $G$ generated by $s$.
  - Prove that \( \gens{ s }\normal G  \) is in fact a **normal** subgroup.

- Let $H\leq G$ be a subgroup and $N\normal G$ be a normal subgroup.
  Show that $NH \leq G$ is a subgroup.

- Let $G_1, G_2$ be groups and $H_2 \leq G_2$ a subgroup.
  Suppose $\phi: G_1\to G_2$ is a group morphism.

- Suppose $\phi: G_1 \to G_2$ is a group morphism.

  - Show that the image $\phi(G_1) \leq G_2$ is a subgroup of $G_2$
  - Show that the preimage $\phi\inv(H_2) \leq G_1$ is a subgroup of $G_1$, 
  - Show that the kernel $\ker \phi \normal G_1$ is a normal subgroup of $G_1$.
  - Prove that group morphisms *preserve coset structure* in the following sense:
  \[
  xH_1 = yH_1 \iff \phi(x)H_2 = \phi(y)H_2
  .\]
  - Prove the **first isomorphism theorem**: 
  $\phi$ is injective $\iff \ker \phi = \ts{ e_{G_1} }$.

### Symmetric Groups

- Let $\sigma = (4\, 2\, 1)(6\, 1\, 3\, 2) \in S_6$ in cycle notation.
  - Write $\sigma$ as a product of disjoint cycles.
  - Compute the order of $\sigma$.
    What is the general theorem about the order of cycles?
  - Determine if $\sigma$ is even or odd.
    What is the general theorem?

- Suppose $\phi: S_n \to G$ with $n$ even and $\# G = m$ odd.
  - Prove that if $\tau \in S_n$ is a transposition, then $\tau \in \ker \phi$.
  - Prove that in fact *every* $\sigma \in S_n$ satisfies $\sigma \in \ker \phi$, so $\phi$ is the trivial morphism.
  - Does this hold if $n$ is odd?

### Matrix Groups

- Let $\FF_p$ be the finite field with $p$ elements, where $p$ is a prime.
  Show that the centers of $\GL_n(\FF_p)$ and $\SL_n(\FF_p)$ consist only of scalar matrices.
  - Show that the scalars $\zeta$ that appear in scalar matrices $Z(\SL_n(\FF_p))$ are roots of unity in $\FF_p$, i.e. $\zeta^p = 1$.

- Determine the orders $\# \GL_n(\FF_p)$ and $\# \SL_n(\FF_p)$.

## Warmup Problems

- (**Important**)
	Prove that if $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic then $G$ is abelian.

- (**Important**)
	Classify all groups of order $p^2$.

- (**Important**)
	Show that if $H\leq G$ and $[G: H] = 2$ then $H$ is normal.
	
	- Suppose that the same result holds with 2 replaced by $p$ defined as the smallest prime factor of $\# G$

- Prove that if $H\leq G$ is a proper subgroup, then $G$ can not be written as a union of conjugates of $H$.

  - Use this to prove that if $G = \Sym(X)$ is the group of permutations on a finite set $X$ with $\# X = n$, then there exists a $g\in G$ with no fixed points in $X$.
 
- Let $G\leq H$ where $H$ is a finite $p\dash$group, and suppose $\phi: G\to H / [H, H]$ be defined by composing the inclusion $G\injects H$ with the natural quotient map $H \to H/[H, H]$.

  Prove that $G= H$ by induction on $\# H$ in the following way:

  - Letting $N\normal H$ be any nontrivial normal subgroup of $H$, use the inductive hypothesis to show that $H = GN$.
  - Let $Z = Z(H)$ be the center of $H$.
  Using that $GZ = H$ by (1), show that $G \intersect Z \neq \emptyset$.
  Set $N \da G \intersect Z$ and apply (1) to conclude.

- Determine all pairs $n, p\in \ZZ^{\geq 1}$ such that $\SL_n(\FF_p)$ is solvable.

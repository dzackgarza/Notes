# Questions

- Can every continuous function on $\bar \DD$ be uniformly approximated by polynomials in the variable $z$?

> Hint: compare to Weierstrass for the real interval.

- Suppose $f$ is analytic, defined on all of $\CC$, and for each $z_0 \in \CC$ there is at least one coefficient in the expansion $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(z-z_0)^n$ is zero.
Prove that $f$ is a polynomial.

> Hint: use the fact that $c_n n! = f^{(n)}(z_0)$ and use a countability argument.

## Warmup

- Define what it means for a function to be **uniformly continuous**.
- Define what it means for a sequence of functions to converge **pointwise** and to converge **uniformly**.
- Give two different definitions for compactness in a metric space.
- Find an example of a metric space with a closed and bounded subspace that is not compact.
	- What is a necessary and 
- Show that if $\sum_{n\in \NN} a_n < \infty$ converges, then $$a_n \ctz{n}$$ and the the tail is small in the following sense: $$\sum_{n > N} a_n \ctz{N}$$
- Is it possible for a function $f:\RR\to \RR$ to be discontinuous precisely on the rationals $\QQ$? If so, produce such a function, if not, why?
	- Can the set of discontinuities be precisely the irrationals $\RR\sm\QQ$?
- Find a sequence of continuous functions that does *not* converge uniformly, but still has a pointwise limit that is continuous.


## Exercises

- Prove the uniform limit theorem: a uniform limit of continuous function is continuous.

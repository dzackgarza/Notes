# Week 1: Preliminaries

## Topics

-   Uniform convergence, M-Test
-   F\_\\sigma and G\_\\delta sets, pathological functions and continuity
-   Nowhere density, Baire category, Heine Borel
-   Normed spaces
-   Series and sequences, convergence, small tails, limsup and liminf, Cauchy criteria for sums and integrals
-   Basic inequalites (triangle, Cauchy-Schwarz)
-   Tools from Calculus: MVT, Taylor's theorem & remainder
-   Weierstrass approximation

## Warmup

- Define what it means for a function to be **uniformly continuous**.
- Define what it means for a sequence of functions to converge **pointwise** and to converge **uniformly**.
- Discuss the $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ of a sequence of real numbers.
- 


## Exercises

- Show that a uniform limit of continuous function is continuous.

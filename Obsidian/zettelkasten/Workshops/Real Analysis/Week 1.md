# Week 1: Preliminaries

## Topics

- Convergence
	- The Cauchy criterion
	-   Uniform convergence, 
		-   $M$-Test
-   $F\_\sigma$ and $G\_\delta$ sets, 
-   Pathological functions and continuity
-   Nowhere density, Baire category, Heine Borel
-   Normed spaces
-   Series and sequences, convergence, small tails, limsup and liminf, Cauchy criteria for sums and integrals
-   Basic inequalites (triangle, Cauchy-Schwarz)
-   Tools from Calculus: MVT, Taylor's theorem & remainder
-   Weierstrass approximation

## Warmup

- Define what it means for a function to be **uniformly continuous**.
- Define what it means for a sequence of functions to converge **pointwise** and to converge **uniformly**.
- Give two different definitions for compactness in a metric space.
- Find an example of a metric space with a closed and bounded subspace that is not compact.
	- How can this be modified to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition?
- Show that if $\sum_{n\in \NN} a_n < \infty$ converges, then $$a_n \ctz{n}$$ and the the tail is small in the following sense: $$\sum_{n > N} a_n \ctz{N}$$
- Is it possible for a function $f:\RR\to \RR$ to be discontinuous precisely on the rationals $\QQ$? If so, produce such a function, if not, why?
	- Can the set of discontinuities be precisely the irrationals $\RR\sm\QQ$?
- Find a sequence of continuous functions that does *not* converge uniformly, but still has a pointwise limit that is continuous.


## Exercises

- Prove the uniform limit theorem: a uniform limit of continuous function is continuous.
- Show that the uniform limit of bounded functions is uniformly bounded.
- Construct sequences of functions $\ts{f_n}_{n\in \NN}$ and $\ts{g_n}_{n\in \NN}$ which converge unformly, such that $\ts{h_n}_{n\in \NN}$ with $h_n \da f_n g_n$ does not converge uniformly.

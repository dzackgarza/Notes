- A homology sphere $X$ is any manifold $X\in \ZHS^n$, and the Poincare homology sphere is a [spherical](spherical%20manifold.md) [3-manifold](3-manifold.md) and is the only $X\in \ZHS^n$ with finite $\pi_1$.

- Its fundamental group is order 120
- Proves that there exist $X\ni \ZHS^n$ where $X\not\cong_\Top S^n$.

- In [global Langlands](Global%20Langlands%20correspondence.md), one considers [moduli spaces](../Moduli%20space.md) of [abelian varieties](../abelian%20variety.md) with additional structure such as [Shimura varieties](Shimura%20variety).

- For [local Langlands](Local%20Langlands%20correspondence.md), the corresponding analog are [Deformation spaces](Deformation%20space) of abelian varieties.

Question: for which $n$ is $S^n$ a topological group?

While hanging out with a few friends, we came up with a question that should have a clear direct answer: is the 2-sphere $S^2$ being a Lie group? If not, what is the obstruction?

My initial intuition here was something along these lines: if $S^2$ were a topological group, we could consider its Lie algebra by taking the tangent space $T_e$ at the identity $e$ (where without loss of generality, we can rotate $S^2$ to identify $e$ with the North pole.) A standard argument shows that the translation maps $\tau_g:x\mapsto gx$ are diffeomorphisms, and are "transitive" in the sense that any point $p_1$ can be carried to $p_2$ by the translation $\tau_{p_2 p_1\inv}$. 

Using this, the heuristic is that we expect the tangent space to "look the same" after performing a series of translations that ultimately maps $e$ to itself, for example
$$
\tau: S^2 \to S^2\\
\tau \definedas \tau_{p_2\inv} \tau_{p_2p_1\inv} \tau_{p_1}.
$$
Specifically, my hope was that the induced map $\tau^*: T_e \to T_e$ would not just be an isomorphism, but in fact the *identity* map. This can be phrased in terms of the parallel transport of a tangent vector $\vector v \in T_e$ along geodesics connecting $e$ to $p_1$, $p_1$ to $p_2$, and finally $p_1$ to $e$. However, because the standard metric on $S^2$ induces nonzero curvature, there is nontrivial holonomy and the vector returns with some rotation. Thus this composition isn't the identity, a contradiction.

It's not so clear to me what part doesn't go through:

- Does nonzero curvature/holonomy on a manifold obstruct it from having a Lie group structure?
- Do all Lie groups have zero curvature and trivial holonomy groups?
  - Note that $\mathrm{Holo}(S^2) =  SO(2, \RR)$.
- Should any composition of translations fixing $e$ induce the identity on $T_e$, or just a vector space automorphism?



It turns out that the following is true:

Theorem
: If $S^n$ is a group, then $n$ must be odd.

Proof
: Suppose otherwise and let $m: (S^n)^2 \to S^n$ be the multiplication. Then $m_g$ defined by $m_g(x) = m(g, x)$ has no fixed points. By Lefschetz, $\Lambda_{m_g} = 0$, so use the fact that $\pi_1S^2 = 0$ to homotope $m_g \sim \id_{S^2}$, which preserves $\Lambda_{m_g}$. But $\Lambda_{\id_X} \chi(X)$ and $\chi(S^2) = 1 + (-1)^n$, and for this to be odd, $n$ must be odd.

In fact, more is true:

Theorem
: $S^n$ is a topological group $\iff n=0,1,3$.

My impression was that this should be related to the fact that the only normed division algebras are $\RR, \CC, \HH$, and \OO$, but couldn't find an obvious proof along those lines. A bit of searching on Math StackExchange turned up the following proofs:

Kummer showed that if a prime $p$ does not divide the class number $h$, then Fermat's Last Theorem holds for exponent $p$.

The Kummer–Vandiver conjecture states that $p$ does not divide the second factor $h_2$. Kummer showed that if $p$ divides the second factor, then $p$ also divides the first factor.

# What is homology?

"Homology" as a word just denotes some kind of study of "sameness", which depends on what context you're in.

It arose out of topology, where we are interested in studying when two manifolds are the "same" up to certain kinds of maps. Most generally, we look at continuous maps between spaces, but one could also look at smooth maps (differential geometry), or holomorphic maps (complex analysis).

This sameness can be useful, because you may end up working with some complicated, unknown sort of object, but maybe you're only interested in the maps into or out of that object (for example, maybe smooth solutions to a differential equation on a manifold). If you know that there is another space that is the "same" up to smooth maps and much easier to deal with, you may be able to pull back results on the easier, well-known object into your complicated object and learn more about what you have.

When you just restrict to continuous maps, though, the discerning feature of spaces is their number of "holes". We say that two spaces are *homeomorphic* if they are equivalent up to continuous maps, which you can alternatively think of as saying that one space can be continuously deformed into the other one. The classic example is that the torus (i.e. the surface of a donut) is equivalent to a coffee cup, due to the fact that both are missing a "hole". 

We have this intuitive notion, but since we are mathematicians, we need to make that precise! And of course, generalize. There are many different ways of defining what exactly an "$n$-dimensional hole" should mean, and homology started off as one of them that wound up being useful and quite successful.



## How was homology first formulated?

There are many different ways to formulate the original homology, but they all roughly follow the same motto: "cycles mod boundaries". 

This originates from the world of manifolds, which are distinguished as topological spaces by their number of holes. One way to measure $n$-dimensional holes is to consider *k-cycles* on the manifold for $1\leq k \leq n$, which are a bit like cutting instructions. A 1-cycle is a set of points to remove, puncturing the manifold. A 2-cycle is a loop you could take scissors to, and in general a $d$-cycle is a $d$-dimensional submanifold. 

Manifolds may or may not have boundaries (**picture: manifold with boundary**), which means that cycles may have boundaries. So to measure the holes, we "mod out" by  those cycles that are actually just the boundary of higher-dimensional cycles. (**picture: quotienting as collapsing to a point**). We call the equivalence classes generated by this quotient **homology classes**, and say that two cycles in the same class are *homologous*.

For example, on $S^2$, every 1-cycle is homologous to zero - any path that is drawn can just be shrunk to a point, there is no obstruction. But on $T$, there are two non-trivial one-cycles - a meridian and the equator. So we can use this formulation to distinguish spaces!

As it turns out, when this is formalized, we can lift these kinds of facts about manifolds and boundaries and cycles over to the world of algebra in a functorial way. 

For a space $X$ and every $n$, one can form a group $H_n(X)$ called the *$n$-th homology group* that encodes the information of what $n$-dimensional holes are in $X$. We can assemble all of these together in a *graded* structure, something indexed by integers, and just generally look at $H(X) = H_0(X) \oplus H_1(X) \oplus \cdots$ where the grading just indicates the dimension to extract.

Intuitively, $H_0(X)$ tells you about the number of connected components, $H_1(X)$ is the number of "areas" missing from $X$, $H_2(X)$ is the number of "volumes" missing, and so on. For these examples, we read off the number by how many times $\ZZ$ appears in the group.

Some examples:

$H(S^1) = (\ZZ, \ZZ, 0, 0, \cdots)$
So we have 1 connected component, 1 one-dimensional hole, and that's it.

$H(B^2) = (\ZZ, 0, 0 , \cdots)$
So the filled in 2-dimensional ball has no holes.

$H(S^2) = (\ZZ, 0, \ZZ, 0, \cdots)$
So we have one connected component, no one-dimensional holes, and one two-dimensional hole.

$H_k(S^n) = \mathbf{1}[k = 0, n]$
In general, the $n$-sphere has one connected component and one $n$-dimensional hole.

# Some Algebraic Background

In order to generalize and apply homology to other areas, we need to pull in a little bit of algebra. First, we need to talk about chain complexes. These can generally be formulated in what are called *abelian categories*, but we'll stay a little more concrete than that for now.

## Kernels, Cokernels, and Abelian Categories

Let's get some terminology out of the way first, starting with something you may be familiar with: kernels.

You might remember this from linear algebra, so let's work in the category of vector spaces for a moment. Given a linear map $T: V \into W$, one interesting thing to look at is $\theset{v\in V \mid T(V) =0 \in W}$. 

If $V,W$ are finite dimensional, then after picking a basis there is a matrix $A$ associated to $T$, and so this is the set of all solutions to the homogeneous equation $Ax = 0$. 

We refer to this set as the **kernel** of $T$. In the finite dimensional setting, this is equivalent to the nullspace of $A$. Notice that $T$ is injective (i.e. one-to-one) if and only if $Ax = 0$ implies $x = 0$, so the kernel is trivial. This holds in many categories!

Staying in the finite setting, we know that $Ax$ lives somewhere in $W$, and it is in fact a subspace. In a general setting, it's not *all* of $W$ - this would require that $W$ and $V$ had the same dimension (so $A$ was square), and also that $A$ had full rank (so $A$ is not singular).

> Note that if we were looking at groups, there is an entirely analogous procedure - $T$ would instead be a homomorphism, and the image $\text{im}~T$ would be a normal subgroup in $W$.

In either case, we can always form the quotient $W / \text{im}~T$, and this is what we'll refer to as the **cokernel**.

In matrices, we just have

$\ker A = \theset{x \mid Ax = 0}$

and

$\text{coker}~A = \theset{y \mid y^T A = 0}$



Intuitively, both the kernel and cokernel carry a lot of information about the map. 

The kernel measures how far the map is from an injection - this is because if the kernel is trivial, then the map is injective, so kernel size somehow measures "distance" from injectivity - larger kernels correspond less injectivity.

The cokernel measures how far the map is from a surjection. This is because if the cokernel is trivial, then $\text{im}~ T$ is the entire target space, and thus $T$ is surjective.

(Advanced note: in full generality, the kernel is defined in terms of a universal property. The cokernel is the categorical dual of the kernel, and satisfies a similar universal property. Duality is important!)

## Exactness

Next let's talk a little bit about exactness. Consider a diagram such as this:

$0 \injects A \xrightarrow{f} B \xrightarrow{g} C \surjects 0$  

where $A,B,C$ are modules (or groups or rings or even vector spaces if you prefer), $f, g$ maps between them as indicated, where left end of the sequence is the inclusion of the trivial module into $A$ and the right end is a map sending every element to the single element of the trivial module.

We say this kind of sequence is **exact** if $\text{im} f = \ker g$. What does this mean for elements? Well, if $a\in A$, then $f(a) \in B$. But if $g$ is defined everywhere on $B$, then it's certainly defined for $f(a)$, and $f(a) \in \ker g$ means that $g(f(a)) = 0$ in $C$.

Equivalently, this just means that $(g\circ f)(a) = 0$ for every element in $A$, or that $g\circ f$ is the zero map.



One concrete benefit of this abstraction is that if we have

$0 \injects A \xrightarrow{f} B \surjects 0$,

then $f$ is an isomorphism, and $A \cong B$.



Another benefit is that if we have a diagram where an $h$ exists such as this

$0 \injects A \xrightarrow{f} B \xtofrom[h]{g} C \surjects 0$ 

where $g \circ h = \id_C$ then (in an *abelian category*) this sequence is said to *split*, and $C \cong B /A$. In other words, this is a generalization of the first isomorphism theorem.

In some instances, this also gives $B \cong A \oplus C$ for some notion of "direct sum" appropriate to the category you're working in.

Informally, when the sequence splits, this says that $B$ is somehow a composite object, inside of which $A$ and $C$ are embedded.



## Prototypes

Here are some places exact sequences naturally arise:

For $N \unlhd G$ a group, 
$0 \into N \into G \into G/N \into 0$

For two distinct groups $H, K$, 
$0 \into H \into H\times K \into K \into 0$.

For two "related" groups, $H, K$, where $\phi: K \into \text{Aut}(K)$:
$0 \into H \into H \rtimes_\phi K \into K \into 0$

The "extension" problem: given $A, C$, and 
$0 \into A \into * \into C \into 0$,

what can be filled in for $*$ to generate an exact sequence? Any such $*$ yields an "extension of $A$ by $C$". In the category of groups, we have a classification of all finite *simple* groups, so a general solution to this problem would yield a classification of **all** finite groups (!!!)

### Nifty application: In vector spaces, every short exact sequence splits.

Let $T: U \into V$ be a linear operator between vector spaces, let $A = \text{nullspace}~T$, $B=V$, $C = \text{range}~T$, then take $f = \id_V$ and $g = T$. Then we recover the rank-nullity theorem from linear algebra, $V \cong \ker T \oplus \text{im} T$ where $\oplus$ is the orthogonal direct sum. (Note that this can also be interpreted as the fact that the map $T$ *factors* into two other maps, one injective and one surjective).



### Example: A SES that doesn't split.

Take $\ZZ \xrightarrow{\times n}\ZZ \xrightarrow{\mod n} \ZZ/n\ZZ$, where $n > 1$.

This is exact, since $x \mapsto nx \mapsto 0$, so the composite is the zero map. But there is no map $g$ that can invert the $f(x) = x\mod n$ map, since $x\in \ZZ \mapsto f(x) \in [0, n-1]$ means that $\abs{(g\circ f)(x)} \leq n < \abs \ZZ$, and the composite can't be surjective. (E.g. this sequence throws away too much information to split!)



## Commutative Diagrams

This one is easy - we say a diagram involving maps between objects if it doesn't matter which path you take between two nodes - the composition of maps yields the same thing in the destination.

![SnakeLemma](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/SnakeLemma_1000.gif)



# The Snake Lemma

So now we can describe what is happening in the movie scene! (Note: this is probably the most advanced mathematics ever displayed in a movie.)

In any abelian category, we can consider things like commutative diagrams and exact sequences - so let's do just this.

What this lemma does, in essence, is give you some information about what happens when you "transform" an exact sequence, or alternatively gives you a way to go back and forth between short and long exact sequences by a "connecting homomorphism". The point of this is that the connecting map you obtain actually tells you about the *existence* of the related kernels and cokernels, providing valuable information about the intermediate maps.

So the setup is this - you have one exact sequence $A,B,C,f,g$ and some transformation $F = (a,b,c)$ that has three maps as its components, and the image of these happens to land on another exact sequence $A', B', C', f', g'$.



![Snake lemma origin.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Snake_lemma_origin.svg/375px-Snake_lemma_origin.svg.png)

As is almost always the case in algebra, we glean a lot of information from the kernels of maps, so one might ask about what's going on with the kernels of $a,b,c$, and it turns out they're given by something like this:

![Snake lemma complete.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Snake_lemma_complete.svg/500px-Snake_lemma_complete.svg.png)

![SnakeLemma2](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/SnakeLemma2_1201.gif)

What this says is that there is *another* exact sequence that you get for free, of the form

$\ker a \into \ker b \into \ker c \xrightarrow{d} \coker a \into \coker b \into \coker c$.



## Chain Complexes

When we have a sequence that is exact everywhere, we say it is a *long exact sequence*

A *chain complex* $\theset{(C_i, \del_i}$ is a sequence, where each $C_i$ is a module (or a group or vector space, if you want) and each $\del_i$ is a morphism (or homomorphism), which are usually denoted the *boundary maps* or *differentials*, satisfying the condition $\del_{n+1} \circ \del_{n} = 0$ (so it is exact everywhere).

Diagrammatically, we have something like this:

$\cdots \xrightarrow{\del_{n+1}} A_{n+1} \xrightarrow{\del_{n}} A_n \into\xrightarrow{\del_{n-1}} A_{n-1} \cdots \xrightarrow{\del_{2}} A_1 \xrightarrow{\del_{1}} A_0 \xrightarrow{\del_{0}} A_{-1} \xrightarrow{\del_{-1}} \cdots$

Every exact sequence is a chain complex, so this can be thought of as a generalization of exact sequences.

Often, you'll see notation abused here, and people will refer to "the" boundary map $\del$. Then the relevant condition is that $\del^2 = 0$.



## Homology From Chain Complexes

For some "nice enough" topological spaces $X$, we can construct a set of building blocks in each dimension $d$, usually referred to as $d$-simplexes, and build $X$ as some combination of those. In fact, if $X$ in an $n$-dimensional manifold, you only need simplexes of degree $n$ or lower.

So for spaces that can be decomposed (or built, depending on your viewpoint) in this way, we can let $C_n$ be the collection of all of the $n$ simplexes. Moreover, some $n$-simplexes have $n-1$ simplexes as boundaries, so we can define the map $\del_n: C_n \into C_{n-1}$ that takes a simplex to its boundary. Since "boundaries don't have boundaries", it turns out that this defines a differential as defined above, and thus $\theset{(C_i, \del_i)}_{i=1}^n$ forms a chain complex.

We can then take the $n$-th homology of $X$ to be the generalization of "cycles mod boundaries", and define $H_n(X) = \ker \del_n / \text{im} ~\del_{n+1}$.4. Given a short exact sequence of chain complexes, we can always "pass to homology" in this way.

## Applying the Snake Lemma

**Theorem**: 
Any short exact sequence of chain complexes induces a long exact sequence of homology modules. 

Let 

$0 \into A \xrightarrow{f} B \xrightarrow{g} C \into 0$ 

be a short exact sequence of modules. Then there is a long exact sequence in homology,

$\into \cdots H_k(A) \xrightarrow{f^*} H_k(B) \xrightarrow{g^*} H_k(C) \xrightarrow{\delta} H_{k-1} (A) \into \cdots$

A critical part of this is the fact that we get a map $\delta: H_k(C) \into H_{k-1}(A)$, so we can work our way towards lower dimensions. (It also helps if $A$ is somehow an easier object to work with)

Thinking of $B$ as an "extension of $A$ by $C$", if we can find choices of $B$ that fit the extension and make the sequence exact, we can glean information about all three objects together.

How is this used? In topology, the idea is that if we know how to glue a space together from small parts, and we understand the gluing maps well enough, then we have an avenue to understand the entire space (via its homology $H_k(X)$ for all $k$). 

One way this is explicitly used is to build the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, which allows us to compute the homology of two spaces whenever we know the homologies of both their union and intersection. (One usually takes these two spaces to be subspaces of a larger space we are interested in).

For example, take the torus $T$ and cut it with a plane through the center into $T = U \coprod V$. Then both $U, V$ are cylinders ($S^1 \times I$), and $U \intersect V = S^1 \coprod S^1$, two disjoint circles. As seen earlier, we can compute homologies for spheres, and this gives us a way of combining that information to compute the homology of something a bit more complicated.

	- Gives a notion of distance along paths in a manifold, generalizing the Pythagorean theorem in Euclidean space.
	- Can be written as a symmetric matrix $$\begin{pmatrix} g_{xx}&g_{xy}\\ g_{yx}&g_{yy}\end{pmatrix}$$
	where we then define the squared distance between two points as
	$$
	\mathrm{d}s^2= g_{xx}\mathrm{d}x^2+g_{yy} \mathrm{d}y^2 + 2 g_{xy}\mathrm{d}x \mathrm{d}y= \sum_{\mu,\nu\in\{x,y\}}g_{\mu\nu}\mathrm{d}l^\mu \mathrm{d}l^\nu
	$$
	Can recover usual metric: by Pythagorean theorem, we have
	$$\mathrm{d}s^2=\mathrm{d}x^2+\mathrm{d}y^2= \sum_{\mu,\nu\in\{x,y\}}g_{\mu\nu}\mathrm{d}l^\mu \mathrm{d}l^\nu$$
	and so we recover a "flat" metric
	$$
	g_{\mu\nu}=\begin{pmatrix} g_{xx}&g_{xy}\\ g_{xy}&g_{yy}\end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix} 1&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}
	$$

	This allows us to measure lengths of paths $\gamma$ by computing $$L = \int_\gamma \mathrm{d}s$$
- The Field Equations
	- $R_{ij} - \frac{1}{2}R g_{ij} + \Lambda g_{ij} = T_{ij}$
	- Postulated by Einstein, fixed by Hilbert
	- $\Lambda < 0$ the cosomological constant introduced by Einstein in order to obtain non-expanding universe - but by evidence from Hubble, it is expanding (and accelerating)
		- Nonzero implies that there is some nonzero energy everywhere, in every metric - used to account for "dark energy".
	- The stress-energy tensor:
		- Can be written as a $4\times 4$ matrix, where the $i,j$ component denotes a "flow of $i$ momentum in the $j$ direction". Flow of $t$ along $t$ is energy, while the others are pressure (think of an ideal gas).
		- English interpretation: drop a sphere full of particles; the rate of shrinkage of the sphere is proportional to its volume, energy density, and pressure in 3 spatial coordinates (so dense objects in small volumes generate gravity!).
- The Geodesic Equations
	- $n$ ODE IVPs for $M^n$, luckily has existence/uniquness

# General vs Special Relativity
Special: light travels at a constant speed for all observers, plus the laws of motion are the same in all inertial (non-accelerating) frames. Makes all physical laws "covariant" (really invariant) under a certain group of coordinate transformations. Encodes quantities like energy and momentum with scalars and 4-vectors. Models spacetime as a manifold that is locally $\RR^3 \cross \RR$ with metric signature $(+,-,-,-)$. Works for reformulating classical laws, but doesn't incorporate gravity.

General: Want a theory that works for accelerating frames and incorporates gravity. Requires bringing together energy, momentum, stress, and pressure, and moving to $4\times4$ tensors instead of 4-vectors. Recover SR by defining inertial frames to travel along geodesics with constant velocity (setting acceleration equal to zero).

# Definition of Spacetime
Spacetime is 4-dimensional topological manifold with a smooth atlas carrying a torsion-free section compatible with a Lorentizan metric and a time orientation satisfying the Einstein equations.


Story:
Hawking did his thesis in the 60s - by then, GR was firmly established based on the results of the "3 big tests":
1. Precession of mercury
2. Gravitational redshift
3. Bending light in gravitational fields

However, the same equation that yields these productions also admits singularities. Are these artifacts of the model, or of coordinate choices? Hawking set off to investigate these singularities.

What is the math of GR? We take spacetime to be a 4 dimensional Riemannian manifold. Then equation the pivotal equation is the Einstein field equations
$$R_{ij} + \frac{1}{2}R g_{ij} + \Lambda g_{ij} = T_{ij}$$

where
- $R_{ij}$ is the Ricci curvature
- $R$ is the scalar curvature
- $g_{ij}$ is the metric tensor
- $\Lambda$ is the "cosmological constant"
- $T_{ij}$ is the stress-energy tensor

The left hand side represents properties of the geometry of space time, while the right hand side indicated properties of matter in a given region.

A priori, this gives 16 tensor equations, each of which is a nonlinear PDE. Using some symmetry, it can be reduced to around 10 equations, but Einstein believed these would be impossible to analytically solve when he published them (< 1915).

Note that solutions to this equation are _metrics_ on spacetime, which in turn can be fed into geodesic equations which give the lengths _worldlines_. Most importantly, gravity acts by moving other bodies along these geodesic paths.

An exact solution that was found almost immediately  (1916) is the Schwarzschild metric, which assumes that the RHS involves a spherical mass with "nice" stress-energy properties and $\Lambda = 0$. The solution metric can be expressed in polar coordinates as
$$ ds^2 = (1-\frac{r_s}{r}) dt^2 - \left( \frac{1}{1-\frac{r_2}{r}} \right)dr^2 - r^2d\theta^2  -r^2\sin^2\theta d\phi^2)
$$

taking $c^2 = 1$, where $r$ is a parameter indicating your distance from the spherical mass and $r_2$ is the "Schwarzschild radius" that is proportional to the mass of the sphere - this is commonly known as the "event horizon".

From this, it is clear that there are two potential singularities - areas where the metric seems to diverge.

The first is a "space-like singularity" at $r=r_s$, which would indicate a singularity over an entire spherical hyper-surface. As it turns out, this is an artifact of coordinates and charts, much like a non-essential singularity in complex analysis, and disappears under a suitable transformation. Inside the event horizon $r < r_s$, a separate equation is needed.

However, the other "time-like" singularity at $r=0$. As it turns out, this one is more serious, and can be shown to be coordinate-independent. Inside the event horizon, worldines at a constant radius do not exists, and all light cones point inwards towards the singularity.

- [[How to extract homology using spectra]]
- [Homotopy groups of spectra](Homotopy%20groups%20of%20spectra)

We have another aim in constructing the category of spectra. In homology theory the suspension homomorphism $\Sigma_*: h_n(X)\to h_{n+1}(\Sigma X)$ is always an isomorphism

There are some things that spaces hide to cohomology theories, and we would like to mod out by this "extra information" that we don't really need when we study spaces by means of cohomology theories. 

The information that spaces hide is the unstable phenomenon, in the following sense : if $X$ and $Y$ are stably equivalent, for example $\Sigma X \homotopic \Sigma Y$, then 
$$
E_*(X)\cong E_{*+1}(\Sigma X) \cong E_{*+1}(\Sigma Y)\cong E_*(Y)
$$ 
for any [generalized cohomology theory](cohomolology%20theory.md) $E_*$. This says that there is no cohomology theory that is going to see a difference between $X$ and $Y$, so we might as well says that they are "the same"

> Cohomology theories do not distinguish stably equivalent spaces.

Another good consequence of spectra is the [Brown Representability](Brown%20Representability) theorem. It says that any [[generalized cohomology theory]] on spaces is representable by a spectra. 

As an aside, a great reason to care about cohomology theories comes from Adams' two solutions to the [[zettelkasten/Hopf invariant one]] problem. His first solution uses ordinary cohomology to do the work, but it is very long and makes extensive use of higher [[zettelkasten/Cohomology operations]]. His second proof (with Atiyah) is beautiful and short, but only because he uses an extraordinary cohomology theory, [[complex K-theory]], to do the job. [More on Hopf invariant](http://people.virginia.edu/~mah7cd/Foundations/Adams,%20Atiyah%20-%20K-theory%20and%20the%20Hopf%20Invariant.pdf)

You may be familiar with a similar problem at the space level. One can construct the [[homotopy category]] of spaces by taking the objects to be CW complexes and the morphisms to be homotopy classes of continuous maps. This is a category, all right, but **it does not contain [pushouts](Pushout) or [sequential colimits](sequential%20colimits)**. 

So you can work with spaces and maps-up-to-homotopy if you like, but you won't be able to do much. It's much better to work with spaces and maps on-the-nose, and to make constructions like the [[double mapping cylinder]] and the [[mapping telescope]] when you want to form [pushouts](Pushout) or [[sequential colimits]]. 

> Slogan: Pass to homotopy as late as possible.

> This is one of the motivations given in Adams' book, which you should read... modulo the part on smash products.

Given a finite CW-complex, $X$, I can embed it into a large sphere $S^n$ in a nice way so that the complement deformation retracts onto a finite CW-complex, $Y$. This is called the **Spanier-Whitehead dual** of $X$. 

The thing is, $Y$ is not determined up to homotopy by $X$. However, the stable homotopy type of $Y$ is determined by $X$, independent of the choice of embedding or sphere.
This basically follows from [[Alexander duality]]. 
So if we want to make arguments exploiting duality, it's best to work in the stable category.

Relation to homotopy: Define a monoid $G_n$ with 

- Objects: smooth structures on the $n$ sphere (identified as oriented smooth $n\dash$manifolds which are homeomorphic to $S^n$)
- Binary operation: Connect sum

For $n\neq 4$, this is a group. Turns out to be isomorphic to $\Theta_n$, the group of $h\dash$cobordism classes of "homotopy $S^n$s"

Recently (almost) resolved question: what is $\Theta_n$ for all $n$?

# Representing cohomology

Definition:
A spectrum $E$ **represents** a cohomology theory $h$ iff
$$
h^{\color{blue} n}(X) = \lim_{{\color{red}k}\to\infty} [ \Sigma^{{\color{red} k} - {\color{blue} n }} X, E_{\color{red} k} ]
$$

Theorem:
Any cohomology theory defined on the category of *compact* topological spaces can be extended to a cohomology theory on $\Top$.

To represent singular cohomology with coefficients in $G$, take the [[suspension spectrum]] of $K(G, 1)$ denoted $HG$ (note: probably not right!!!) then $H^n(X; G) = [X, HG_n] = [X, K(G, n)]$.

[Spectra have homotopy groups](Homotopy%20groups%20of%20spectra), e.g.

\pi_{k}(H G)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
G & k=0 \\
0 & k \neq 0
\end{array}\right.

**Definition:**
A map $\pi: \Sigma \to \Sigma'$ of Riemann surfaces is said to be *ramified* at a point $p\in \Sigma'$ iff in local charts $\pi$ has the form $z\mapsto z^n$ for some $n>1$.

> I.e. all points in a punctured neighborhood of $\pi(p)$ have $n$ preimages.

**Definition:**
If $\pi$ is ramified at $p$, the number of preimages $n$ is referred to as $e_p$, the *ramification index of $p$*.

*Fact:*
$\vector{\beta}(\Sigma_g) = [1, 2g, 1, 0, \cdots]$ and $\chi(\Sigma) = 2-2g$.

**Theorem:**
If $\pi$ is an unramified covering map of degree $n$, then $\chi(\Sigma') = n\chi(\Sigma)$.

**Theorem (Riemann-Hurwitz):**
If $\pi: \Sigma \to \Sigma'$ is a ramified covering map of degree $N$, then

\begin{align*}
\chi(\Sigma') = N \chi(\Sigma) - \sum (e_p - 1) \quad\text{ i.e. } 2 g(\Sigma') - 2=  N(2g(\Sigma) - 2)  + \sum (e_p - 1)
.\end{align*}

*Another useful form:*
Let $r \in \Sigma'$ be the number of ramification points, and $b$ the number of branch points, i.e. their images in $\Sigma$.
Then

\begin{align*}
\chi(\Sigma') = N(\chi(\Sigma) - b) + r
.\end{align*}


**Holomorphic Forms:**
A holomorphic $p\dash$form on $X$ is a section of $\Lambda^p T\dual X$, the $p$th exterior power of the holomorphic cotangent bundle of $X$.

For $n = \dim_\CC X$, the $n\dash$forms are an important special case.
Any such form $w$ is given in local coordinates $(z_1, \cdots, z_n)$ by 

\begin{align*}
w = w(z_1, \cdots, z_n) dz_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dz_n
\end{align*}

for some holomorphic function $w: \CC^n \to ?$.

**Canonical Bundle:**
Given a complex manifold $M$, we can define the tangent bundle $\CC^n \to TM \to M$ and the cotangent bundle $\CC^n \to T\dual M \to M$, which we'll just denote $T\dual M$.
Then the canonical bundle is the bundle $\CC\to \Lambda^n T\dual M \to M?$, denoted by $\omega$, obtained by taking the $n$th exterior power.

It is a theorem that the fibers are in fact complex lines $\CC^1$.
For vector bundles, this is referred to as the *determinant bundle*.
If $M$ is a smooth manifold, then $\omega$ has a global section.

> Note: a holomorphic $n\dash$form is exactly the same as a section of the canonical bundle.

Interesting aside: a Calabi-Yau is a manifold with a nowhere vanishing holomorphic $n\dash$form, which implies that the canonical bundle admits a map to a trivial line bundle that is an isomorphism, i.e. the canonical bundle is trivial.

*Exercise:*
For $\Sigma_g$ a compact Riemann surface of genus $g$, the dimension of the space of holomorphic sections of the canonical bundle, i.e. the space of holomorphic differentials on $\Sigma_G$, is given by $\dim H^0(X; \Omega) = g$ (the genus of the surface).
Proof: use Riemann-Roch.

Classification of elliptic orbifolds of dimension 2:
Define $(n_1, \cdots; m_1, \cdots)$ as the *profile*, where $n_i$ are *elliptic* points (locally look like quotient by $\ZZ/n\ZZ$), and $m_i$ are *corner reflectors* (locally look like quotient by a dihedral group):

![Image](figures/2020-01-29-20:44.png)\


Conformal (or equivalently complex) structures on a genus $g$ surface form a moduli space $\MM_g$ of dimension $3g-3$ for $g > 1$.

Let $\alpha$ be any partition of $2g-2$, and $\mch(\alpha)$ the moduli space of pairs $(\Sigma_g, \omega)$ where $\Sigma_g$ is a Riemann surface of genus $g$ and $\omega$ is a holomorphic 1-form (Abelian differential) on $M$ with the orders of its zeros given by $\alpha$.
Letting $\mch$ be the moduli space of all abelian differentials on Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ is stratified by $\mch(\alpha)$ as $\alpha$ ranges over all partitions.
For flat tori, $\mch = \GL_+(2, \RR)/\SL(2, \ZZ)$.

For $\Sigma_g$ a Riemann surface, there is a formula (Gauss-Bonnet in the flat metric) relating the degrees of the zeros of a holomorphic 1-form to the genus:

\begin{align*}
\sum d_j = 2g-2
.\end{align*}



# Notes on Paper

> Reference: [https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0609392](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0609392)

## Section  1

Flat surfaces are characterized as surfaces with a flat metric and (finitely many?) cone-like singularities.
These surfaces appear to be isomorphic to moduli spaces of holomorphic 1-forms.
It is profitable to study the orbit of the surface under the Teichmüller geodesic flow, as well as a $\GL_n$ action.

Some introductory surveys:

- A. Eskin [E], 
- G. Forni [For2], 
- P. Hubert and T. Schmidt [HuSdt5] 
- H. Masur [Ma7],
- H. Masur and S. Tabachnikov [MaT] 
- J. Smillie [S].


We usually associate

- Constant positive curvature = $S^2$
- Constant zero curvature = $S^1 \cross S^1 \definedas T^1 = \Sigma_1$
- Constant negative curvature = $\Sigma_g$ for $g\geq 2$, a surface of higher genus

**Proposition:**
Any surface can be given a flat metric, possibly introducing singular points.

> Idea: Push all of the curvature into a cone point.

*Example:*
The standard cube embedded in $\RR^3$.

This is a flat surface with 8 cone points located at the vertices.
Note that the metric is non-degenerate on the edges, since any neighborhood of a point on an edge is still homeomorphic to $\RR^2$:

![Image](figures/2020-01-11-23:54.png)

Any neighborhood of a vertex is isometric to the vertex of the usual notion of a cone.
The cone angle can be measured by cutting a cone from the base to the vertex, yielding a flat pattern that sits in $\RR_2$, and measuring the "missing" angle in the resulting circle:

![Image](figures/2020-01-12-00:00.png)

This shows that the cone angle of the cube is $3\pi/2$, which coincides with the fact that there are 3 square (and thus 3 right angles) adjacent to any cone point.

**Definition:**
Geodesic (todo)

**Definition:**
Ergodic (todo)

> Here this means that a typical geodesic will visit any region in phase space and time spent in a region is proportional to volume.


**Definition:**
Holonomy and Holonomy group (todo)

General (wildly open) problem:

- Describe the behavior of a generic geodesic on a surface
- Prove that the geodesic flow is ergodic on a typical flat surface
- Does almost every surface have a closed geodesic that does not pass through singular points?
  - If so, how many?
  - Find the (asymptotic) number of such closed geodesics of length shorter than $L$

This remains unsolved for $S^2$ with 3 singularities (equivalent to a certain billiards problem). 
It is not even known if any flat sphere admits a single closed geodesic.

Flat surfaces have nontrivial holonomy, which makes them resemble Riemannian manifolds more than flat tori.

If we take the surface and puncture the conical points, it is locally isometric to the punctured Euclidean plane.
This allows a notion of parallel transport of tangent vectors.

Parallel transports along homotopically trivial loops are always the identity; otherwise, for homotopically nontrivial loops this rotates the vector by some angle.
Parallel transport around a cone point rotates by exactly the cone angle.
Nontrivial holonomy forces geodesics to self-intersect many times.

> Exercise: parallel transport a vector around the cone point of a cube.

The flat torus has trivial linear holonomy -- all geodesics either close up, or never self-intersect and produce a dense winding path.

**Definition:**
A translation surface is closed orientable surface with a flat metric, a finite number of conical singularities, and trivial linear holonomy.

Note that trivial linear holonomy implies that cone angles are all integer multiples of $2\pi$.

> Convention: we assume all flat surfaces come with a distinguished direction.

Remark:
Billiards gives rise to a flat surface with nontrivial linear holonomy. 

**Definition:**
A half-translation surface is a surface with a flat metric and holonomy group $\ZZ/(2)$.

> In this case, a vector $\vector v$ may come back as $-\vector v$ after parallel transport.

We'll often consider families of flat surface sharing the same genus and number/type of conical singularities.
These will correspond to strata of moduli spaces of one-forms.

It will often be useful to let $\SL(2, \RR)$ act on these families, consider the orbits, and take its closure.

Central problem / conjecture:
Taking the closure of an orbit under the action of $\GL^+(2, \RR)$ is a complex subvariety, so both the moduli space of holomorphic one-forms and the moduli space of quadratic differentials resemble homogeneous spaces under the action of a unipotent group.

The there is a projection from these orbits (Teichmüller discs)  to the moduli space of complex structures (?), which will be denoted $\MM_g$.
It is well-known that moduli spaces are not homogeneous spaces, but the conjecture here is that they behave as if they were.

## Section 2: Motivations

Open problems in rectangular billiards:

1. Describe the behavior of a billiard trajectory in a generic triangle, and prove that the billiard flow is ergodic.
2. Does (almost) any table have at least one regular periodic trajectory? Is it preserved under deformations?
3. Asymptotically in length, how many periodic trajectories are there? 
4. Does any obtuse triangle have a single periodic trajectory?

*Known example:* 
Acute triangles have at least 1, see Fagnano trajectory 

*Fox-Kershner construction:*
Yields a way to go from billiard trajectories to geodesics on a flat surface.
General idea: glue two copies of the billiard table along the edge to get a flat sphere; then paths lift to geodesics.
Such surfaces are not "very flat", i.e. they have nontrivial linear holonomy.

title: Notes on Tilings

# Thursday, Week 1 

**Motivation:** 
Gauss' Unicursal Problem.
How many distinct curves $\alpha: [0, 1] \to \RR^2$ are there with no triple crossings?

Note that if we compactify the plane to the Riemann sphere (and possibly take the curve to be piecewise linear) then we obtain a *tiling* of the sphere.
We can also take a *dual tiling* by taking the barycenters of each polygon and connecting them by an edge iff their corresponding polygons share an edge.

**Definition:**
A *translation surface* is the 2-dimensional topological manifold obtained by taking any set of polygons in $\RR^2$ and gluing their edges by translations.

*Example:*
Any elliptic curve (topologically a torus) is a translation surface.

We take equivalence up to cutting, pasting, and rearranging.

**Lemma:**
Two elliptic curves (of genus 2) are isomorphic iff the translation surfaces differ by a homothety, i.e. a rotation and scaling.

> Note: we will eventually see that the data of a translation surface is equivalently a holomorphic 1-form.

**Definition:**
A *half-translation surface* is a translation surface where we now additionally allow gluing by rotations of $\pi$ radians.

*Example:*

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
		\node[fill=black, shape=circle]  (0) at (-3, 3) {};
		\node[fill=black, shape=circle]  (1) at (3, 3) {};

**Lemma:**
Any game of *rectangular billiards* yields a half-translation surface.

Given any domain for rectangular billiards, we inflate it to a surface:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}

We can then cut along everything but the bottom edge to "unwrap" it into a half-translation surface:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}

Some questions related to rectangular billiards:

**Question 1:**
Given a random starting point and direction, what proportion of the total region is traversed?
Will the trajectory entire a given region?
How long does the billiard spend in any given region?

**Theorem:**
The percentage of time spent in a given region is equal to the proportion of its area to the total area.

> This requires some ergodic theory.

**Question 2:**
If you shine a laser from a given spot, is the entire region illuminated?

**Theorem:**
No! There is a counterexample with 18 sides.
Moreover, no positive-area region can be avoided, but certain finite sets can.

**Definition:**
A *flat surface* is a generalization of translation surfaces that now allows gluing by any isometry of $\RR^2$.

*Example:*
A cube in $\RR^3$ is a flat surface, noting that the planar gluing diagram for it now requires rotations of $\pi/2$ radians:

![Image](figures/2020-01-11-22:16.png)\

Note that we can form higher genus surfaces using polygon gluing:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={fill=black,shape=circle,scale=0.5},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
		\node[style=none] (0) at (-0.75, 2.5) {};
		\node [style=none] (1) at (0.75, 2.5) {};

		\node [style=none] (5) at (1.75, -0.25) {};
		\node [style=none] (6) at (-0.75, -1.5) {};
		\node [style=none] (7) at (0.75, -1.5) {};

		\draw (0.center) to node [auto] {$d$}  (8.center);
		\draw (8.center) to node [auto] {$a$}  (4.center);
		\draw (4.center) to node [auto] {$b$}  (6.center);
		\draw (6.center) to node [auto] {$c$}  (7.center);
		\draw (7.center) to node [auto] {$d$}  (5.center);
		\draw (5.center) to node [auto] {$a$}  (3.center);
		\draw (3.center) to node [auto] {$b$}  (1.center);
		\draw (1.center) to node [auto] {$c$}  (0.center);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

**Exercise:** 
Check that there is only one vertex in this polygon.

In general, the vertices may have total angle greater than $2\pi n$.
We refer to these as *cone points*, and the total angle as the *cone angle*.

**Exercise:**
Check that the cone angle in the above example is $6\pi$ by taking a loop around the cone point.

> Note on a weird phenomenon: it seems difficult to find $\ZZ^2$ or $\QQ^2$ points on the sloped edges of a regular polygon, based on computer drawings.

*Remark:*
This flat surface admits charts to $\CC$ with the following transition functions.
Let $P$ denote the single cone point.

Then there is a 3-fold cover give by the following space, thought of as a singular helical

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={fill=black,shape=circle,scale=0.5},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
	\draw (0, 0) circle (3cm);
	\node [style=none, label=P] (0) at (0, 0) {};
	\node [style=none] (1) at (3, 0) {};
	\draw (0.center) to node [above] {$C$} node [below] {$A$} (1.center);

	\draw (0, -7) circle (3cm);
	\node [style=none, label=P] (0) at (0, -7) {};
	\node [style=none] (1) at (3, -7) {};
	\draw (0.center) to node [above] {$A$} node [below] {$B$} (1.center);

	\draw (0, -14) circle (3cm);
	\node [style=none, label=P] (0) at (0, -14) {};
	\node [style=none] (1) at (3, -14) {};
	\draw (0.center) to node [above] {$B$} node [below] {$C$} (1.center);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

which maps onto the unit disc in $\CC$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={fill=black,shape=circle,scale=0.5},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
	\draw (0, 0) circle (3cm);

	\node [style=none, label=P] (P) at (0, 0) {};
	\node [style=none] (u1) at  ({1*360/3}: 3cm){};
	\node [style=none] (u2) at  ({2*360/3}: 3cm){};
	\node [style=none] (u3) at  ({3*360/3}: 3cm){};

	\draw (P) to (u1);
	\draw (P) to (u2);
	\draw (P) to (u3);

	\node [label=1] (u1) at  ({1*360/6}: 1.5cm){};	
	\node [label=2] (u1) at  ({3*360/6}: 1.5cm){};
	\node [label=3] (u1) at  ({5*360/6}: 1.5cm){};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The covering map from the former to the latter is given by $z\mapsto z^{\frac 1 3}$, which coincides with the fact that the cone angle at $P$ is $3(2\pi) = 6\pi$.

One can also imagine this space in $\RR^3$ with a projection onto the plane:
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.16,width=10cm,height=14cm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[trig format plots=rad,
		view={-40}{6*pi},
		colormap={adopted}{
			rgb255(0cm)=(219,0,70);
	    rgb255(1cm)=(55,70,170);
			rgb255(2cm)=(219,0,70)
		},
		z buffer=sort,
		zmin=0]
\addplot3 [surf,domain=0.001:4,domain y=-pi/2:6*pi-pi/2,samples=25,samples y=40]
({x*cos(y)},{x*sin(y)},{ln(x)+y});
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Here the helicoid goes through three full twists, where the top and bottom pieces are identified.

**Proposition:**
In a neighborhood of a cone point $P$ with cone angle $2\pi n$, the map $z\mapsto z^{\frac 1 n}$ will be a local chart for any $z$ in a neighborhood of $P$.

This gives the resulting surface the structure of a *Riemann surface*, i.e. a surface admitting charts to $\CC$ with holomorphic transition functions.

Let $X$ be a Riemann surface, we can look at the *canonical bundle* over $X$ with sections that are compatible collections of $f_u(z_u) ~dz_u$ for each chart $z_u$, and for each such chart a holomorphic function $f_u(z_u)$ on $z_u(U)$ where on overlaps

\begin{align*}
f_u(z_u) ~dz_u &= f_v(z_v) ~dz_v \\
&= f_v(z_v \circ z_u) z_v'(z_u) ~dz_u
.\end{align*}

**Updated Definition:**
A *translation surface* is a Riemann surface with a section of its canonical bundle.

*Example:*
$C/\Lambda$ for $\Lambda$ any rank-2 lattice:

![Image](figures/2020-01-11-23:35.png)

> Note that the translation here is given by $\vector \lambda$.

**Definition:**
A holomorphic 1-form is a section of the canonical bundle.

*Example:*
For the above surface, we have $z_v = z_u + \vector \lambda$ and thus $dz_u = dz_v$ is nonvanishing.

Note that $dz$ is a holomorphic 1-form on the complement of the vertex/vertices of the polygon.

**Proposition:**
$dz$ extends holomorphically to charts containing cone points with cone angle $2\pi n$ and has a zero of order $n-1$ at such cone points.

*Example:*
For the chart $z=w^3$ where $w$ is the local coordinate, we have $dz = 3w^2$, yielding a zero of order 2.

## Correspondence

**Recall:**
Start with a translation surface with cone points with angles $2\pi n i$.
This yields a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ and a holomorphic $1\dash$form $\omega$ with zeros of order $n_i -1$.

Given a square fundamental domain, there is an order 4 automorphism given by rotating 90 degrees.
In charts, this is multiplication by $i$ and possibly a translation, which is a holomorphic map $f: \Sigma \selfmap$.
We then have $f^*(dz) = d(f(z)) = idz$, so $dz$ is an eigenvector for $f^*$.

An elliptic curve can be specified by $y^2 = f_4(x)$ for a degree 4 polynomial, so we can obtain it as a double branched cover of $S^2$.
(i.e. glue along the slits joining pairs of roots)

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-21:56.png)\

Take $E : y^2 = x^4 - 1$, this is the only elliptic curve with an order 4 automorphism.
In coordinates, this is generated by $(x, y) \mapsto (-ix ,y)$.
So $\omega = c \frac{dx}{y}$, i.e. $dx/y$ up to scaling, and $f^*(dx/y) = i \frac{dx}{y}$.
What is the constant $c$?

Take closed cycles on $E$ given by $\alpha, \beta$ (see diagram), then by FTC $\int_\alpha \omega = z \mid_0^1 = 1$.
Negation is 4 fixed points on the elliptic curve, the 2-torsion points.

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-21:55.png)\

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-21:57.png)\

We can then compute

\begin{align*}
I = \int_\alpha  \frac{dx}{y} = \int_1^2 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^4 - 1}} 
.\end{align*}

and since $2c I = 1$, this uniquely determines $c$.

> Note that this can be numerically evaluated, but this is an elliptic integral with (possibly) no elementary antiderivative.

Consider the decagon with sides identified.
We get a complex structure $(\Sigma, \omega)$ with cone angles $4\pi$ and $dz$ has 2 zeros of order 1 (namely the two cone points).

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-21:58.png)\

What is the genus?
The degree of the canonical bundle is 
$$
g(\Sigma) = \deg K_\Sigma = 2g - 2 = \sum_{p\in \Sigma}\ord_p \omega
$$ 
and thus $g = 2$.

**Fact:**
Every genus 2 curve is a double branched cover of $\PP^1$ branched over 6 points.

> Use Riemann-Roch.

Consider automorphisms that preserve the decagon.
Rotation by $\pi/10$ swaps the two cone points, to take rotation by $-2\pi/5$ (inserting the negative to account for pullbacks).
Then $f^* \omega = \zeta_5 \omega$, where again we just write locally $z \mapsvia{f} \zeta_5\inv + c \implies f^* dz = \zeta_5 dz$.

Consider points of order $5$ on $\PP^1$, we can take $\zeta_5^k$ and $\infty$.

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-21:58.png)\

This corresponds to the curves $y^2 = x^5 - 1$, with an automorphism $(x, y) \mapsto (\zeta_5 x, y)$.
This is the only genus 2 curve with an order 5 automorphism.

**Fact:**
The space of sections of the canonical $H^0(K_{\mathcal E}) = \CC^g$.

We can write a basis for the space of 1-forms: $\frac{dx}{y}$ and $(1-x) \frac{dx}{y}$.
Alternatively, $\omega = (a+bx) \frac{dx}{y}$ where $a, b \in \CC$.
What are the zeros of $\omega$?
$V(\omega) = V(a + bx)$ where if $b=0$ it's $\infty$.
Because this has to preserve the order 5 symmetric and map cone points to themselves, this forces $\omega = bx \frac{dx}{y}$, which has exactly two zeros: $(x, y) = (0, \pm i)$.

We can also consider the doubled pentagon, which has only one point.
This has an automorphism given by rotating each pentagon by $1/5$, it has cone angle $6\pi$, and $\omega$ has a double zero at the cone point.
Since there is only *one* genus 2 curve with order 5 automorphisms, this yields the previous Riemann surface but a distinct translation surface and a distinct form.

We can write $\alpha = a \frac{dx}{y}$.

**Proposition:**
One Riemann surface has many translation structures, and the space of such structures is the space of 1-forms.

*Proof:*
Pick a chart $w: U \to \CC$ avoiding the zeros of $\omega$.
Then $\omega = f(z) ~dz$ in this chart, and we want to compose with a biholomorphism $x$ to obtain a new chart $z$ such that $\omega = dz$ in this chart.
We can solve $dz = e = f(w) ~dw$ and $\frac{dz}{dw} = f(w)$ and by integrating we get $z(w) = \int_{p_0}^w f(w_0) dw_0$.
In this chart, $\omega = dz$, and we can correct near zeros by finding charts such that $\omega = z^n dz$ where $n$ is the order of the zero.

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-21:59.png)\

What does this buy us?
We get a translation structure by considering transitions, and $\omega = dz_1 = dz_2 \implies z_1 = z_2 + c$, which is exactly a translation structure.
Thus every $(\Sigma, \omega)$ has a translation structure for which $\omega = dz$ in local polygonal charts.

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-22:00.png)\

**Theorem:**
There is a bijection 

\begin{align*}
\correspond{\text{Translation surfaces with cone angles $2\pi n i$ }} \iff
\correspond{\text{$(\Sigma, \omega)$ a Riemann surface with holomorphic}\\ \text{1-forms with zeros of order $n_i - 1$}}
.\end{align*}

What do half-translations correspond to?
Note that $dz \mapsto -dz$, so we don't get a well-defined holomorphic 1-form.

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-22:01.png)\

The fix? 
$(dz)^2$ is some well-defined object. 
What is it?

The set $\theset{f(z) (dz)^2 = g(w)(dw)^2}$ corresponds with line bundles with transition functions given by $(dz/dw)^2$.

Thus the correspondence is 

\begin{align*}
\correspond{\text{Half translation surfaces with cone angle $\pi n_i$}}
\iff
\correspond{\text{Riemann surfaces with $q$ a section of $K_\Sigma^{\tensor 2}$ }}
.\end{align*}

I.e., these correspond with sections of the second tensor power of the canonical bundle of $\Sigma$.

A defining property of $q = (dz)^2$ for half-translation charts $z$: we can measure the order of the zero by going to charts, finding a chart to $\CC$ (see image) e.g. $w = z^{2/3}$, and then defining 
$$
\omega = dz = d(w^{3/2}) = 3/2 w^{1/2} dw
$$

Then $q = w^2 = (dz)^2$ is well-defined and equal to $\frac{9}{4} w (dw)^2$ in the local chart $w$. 

In this case, we get points that are *poles* of order 1 for the quadratic differential (sections of $K^{\tensor 2})$.

> Note: 1-forms are referred to as "abelian differentials" in the literature.

We know that $K_{\PP^1} = \mathcal O(-2)$ and $K_{\PP^1}^{\tensor 2} = \mathcal O(-4)$.

## Moduli Spaces

**Definition:**
$\mathcal{H}(k_1, \cdots, k_n) = \theset{ \Sigma \text{ with abelian differential}  \div \omega = \sum k p_i}$ where the $k_i$ record the orders of zeros of $\omega$.

> Second condition on divisor records zeros.

Similarly, define $Q(k_1, \cdots, k_n) = \theset{\cdots \suchthat \text{quadratic differential}}$ where now $k_i \geq -1, \neq 0$.

These moduli spaces are called *strata of abelian/quadratic differentials*.

Consider $M_g$, the moduli space of genus $g$ surfaces.
There is a vector bundle (the Hodge bundle) over $M_g$ where the fiber over $[c]$ is $H^0(K_C)$ with strata given by $Q$.

This is a bundle of rank $g$, and by Riemann-Roch, ? $3g-3$ and is the (co?)tangent bundle of something.

There is an $\SL(2, \RR)$ action on any stratum.
How to define -- use isomorphism with translation structures (see image) by just applying any such form $\gamma$ to the entire plane and gluing polygons in the same way.
This gives a non-holomorphic action on any stratum.

> Next time: to special case of square tiled surfaces.

# Thursday January 23rd

## Counting Square Tiled Surfaces 
Square tiled surfaces in $\mch(k)$ with $d$ squares correspond to degree $d$ branched covers of the identification square, branched over the origin, with profile (?).

To count square-tiled surfaces: label squares, look at inverse images of $\ast$ by $\theset{1 ,\cdots, d}$.
Consider the monodromy representation $\rho: \pi_1( \TT \setminus \theset{0}, \ast ) \to S_d$ where $\sigma = \rho(\alpha) = (1)(23)$ and $\tau = \rho(\beta) = (12)(3)$.
We compute ramification orders by considering the commutators $[\alpha, \beta]$.
Then $\rho([\alpha, \beta] )$ has cycle type $(1, 1, \cdots 1, 1+k, \cdots, 1+ k_n)$.
Note that $[(23), (12)]$ is a 3 cycle.

![Image](figures/2020-01-23-14:32.png)\

**Conclusion:**
The number of square-tiled surfaces in $\mch(k)$ with $d$ squares is exactly 
$$
\frac{1}{d!} \abs{\theset{\sigma, \tau \in S_d \suchthat [\sigma, \tau] \in C_{1, \cdots, 1, 1+k, \cdots, 1+ k_n}}}
.$$

Note that the division is due to the artificial labeling of squares.

**Main theorem from "Branched Covers of Torus" Paper:**
The generating function 
$$
f_\kappa(q)\definedas \sum_{d\geq 1} \#\theset{\text{Square tiled, $d$ squares in $\mch(k)$}} q^d
$$ 
is a **modular form**.

Follows from taking $q = e^{2\pi i \tau}$ which is holomorphic on $\HH$ the upper half-plane, satisfying a transformation rule with respect to $\tau \mapsto -1/\tau$, which is a finite-dimensional space.

> Actual: quasimodular mixed form.

The weights are bounded by $\abs \kappa + \ell(\kappa)$.

Concretely, $f_\kappa \in \QQ[E_2, E_4, E_8]$ where $E_k(q) = \text{const} + \sum_{d \geq 1} \sigma_{k-1}(d) q^d$, where $\sigma_{k-1}(d) = \sum_{e\mid d} e^{k-1}$.
This is the ring of quasimodular forms.

- $1$ is weight 0,
- $E_2$ is weight 2,
- $E_2^2, E_4$ are weight 4,
- $E_2^3, E_2 E_4, E_6$ are weight 6, etc

*Example:*
Take $\kappa = \theset{2} \iff \mch(2)$, then $\abs \kappa + \ell(\kappa) = 3$ and $f_{\theset z}(q) = c_1 + c_2 E_2(q)$.
In this case $[q^1] = [q^2] = 0$.

Note that surfaces in $\mch(2)$ have 1 vertex of cone angle $6\pi$ and all others of angle $2\pi$, corresponding to an abelian differential with a single zero of order 2.

A special type of square-tiled surfaces: 1 cylinder surfaces, where $\rho(\alpha)$ is a full length cycle.

This is in $\mch(3, 1)$, and corresponding surface $(\Sigma, \omega)$, which is a holomorphic 1-form with a triple zero and a single zero.
By Riemann-Hurwitz, $2g-2 = \deg \omega = 3+1 \implies g = 3$.

> Note: the genus here difficult to compute otherwise!


**Main Result of 1-Cylinder Surface Paper:**
1-cylinder surfaces have roughly a $1/d$ proportion in all square tiled surfaces, where $d = \dim \mch(\kappa)$.

Recall that we can get a square tiled surface from any unicursal curve:

![Image](figures/2020-01-23-14:41.png)\

Note that these aren't always translation surfaces:

![Image](figures/2020-01-23-14:43.png)\

This has transition maps that looks like $z \mapsto i^k z + z_0 = w$ and thus $dz = i^k dw$, so $dz^k$ is the well-defined object here.

Recall

- $(\Sigma, dz) \iff$ translation surfaces
- $(\Sigma, (dz)^2) \iff \frac 1 2 \dash$translation surfaces
- $(\Sigma, (dz)^4) \iff \frac 1 4\dash$translation surfaces
  - I.e. a Riemann surface with a section of $K_\eps^{\tensor 4}$. 


Can consider a *tricursal* curve instead (a curve that requires lifting the pen 3 times).
Taking the dual complex yields a cube. 

![Image](figures/2020-01-23-14:52.png)\

This has charts $w = z^{4/3}$ and thus $(dz)^4 = w\inv (dw)^4$.
Let $\mch(\kappa)$ be the quartic differentials with $dv \omega = \sigma \kappa_i p_i$.
Then the cube is in $\mch_4(-1, \cdots -1)$ with $8$ copies of $-1$.

This gives cone angles $n \frac{2\pi}{4}$ and the order of the zero/pole is $n-4$.

This example is in $\mch_4(-3, -3, -2)$.

**Proposition:**
The generating functions for square-tiled surfaces $\mch_4(\kappa)$ is now a quasimodular form for $\Gamma_1(4)$.

## Open Questions

**Question (can find numerical evidence?):**
How can we count these in terms of the symmetric group? 
Analogous result to proportion result earlier?
Can try to lift square example, but admits no map from a torus -- instead, quotient square by $\ZZ/4\ZZ$ and take fundamental domain.
What kind of branching do these covers have?

Every center of a square is branched of order 4.
Every center of an edge is branched of order 2.
The ramification order of a vertex is its valence, divided by the number of squares meeting at that vertex.
The degree of the covering map is $4n$ where $n$ is the number of squares.

Identify the fundamental domain with $\PP^1$,
We get a monodromy representation:

\begin{align*}
\rho: \pi_1(\PP^1 \setminus(0, 1,\infty), \ast) \to S_{4d} \\
\gamma_0 \mapsto \rho(\gamma_0)
.\end{align*}

Note that $\gamma_0 \gamma_1 \gamma_\infty = 1$.

![Image](figures/2020-01-23-15:13.png)\

It then follows that this has cycle type $(4, \cdots ,4)$.

So the number of square tiled surfaces in $\mch_4(\kappa)$ is given by

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{(4d)!} = \# \theset{ (\sigma_0, \sigma_1, \sigma_\infty) \suchthat \sigma_0 \in C_{4, \cdots, 4} (d), \sigma_1 \in C_{2, \cdots ,2} (2d), \sigma_{\infty} \in C_{4, \cdots ,4, 4+k, \cdots, 4 + k_n}, \sigma_0 \sigma_1 \sigma_\infty = 1}
.\end{align*}

Would be nice to figure out what the proportionality constant here is.

# Ben's Talk: Eskin's Ramified Coverings of a Torus

Today: Section 2.
Main theorem: a certain generating function is quasimodular.

Consider a torus $T$ with marked points $Z = \theset{z_1, \cdots z_s}$ with a map $\sigma: \Sigma \to T$ which is *unramified* outside of $Z$.

![Image](figures/2020-01-30-14:04.png)

Then $\sigma$ is determined by the representation $\pi_1(T\setminus Z, \ast) \to \Aut(\sigma\inv(\ast)) \cong S_d$ if $\sigma$ is a degree $d$ cover.
There is a correspondence

\begin{align*}
\correspond{\text{d-fold covers ramified over } \theset{z_i}} 
\iff
\hom(\pi_1(T\setminus Z, \ast), S_d)
.\end{align*}

Fix $C_1, \cdots, C_s$ conjugacy classes in $S_d$, and let $H_d(C_1, \cdots, C_s)$ be the homomorphisms sending small loops around $z_i$ to $C_i$.

![Image](figures/2020-01-30-14:09.png)\

Then cycle types correspond to branching orders over points.

One way to count d-fold covers is to look at the weights of $\Aut(\sigma)$.
We define

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Cov}_d (C_1, \cdots, C_s) = \sum_{\sigma \in H_d(C_i) / S(d)} \frac{1}{\abs{\Aut(\sigma)}} = \frac{\abs{H^d(C_1, \cdots, C_2)}}{d!}
.\end{align*}

This just yields a number, so we can define a generating function:

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Cov}(C_1, \cdots, C_s) = \sum_{d=0}^\infty q^d \mathrm{Cov}_d(C_1, \cdots, C_s)
.\end{align*}

**Important note:**
To make sense of $C_i$ in all $S^d$, write $C_i = (m_{i1}, \cdots , m_{ik})$ and set $\mathrm{Cov}_d(C_i) = 0$ iff $i_k < d$, and otherwise pad with 1s to get $C_i \definedas (m_{i1}, \cdots, m_{ik}, 1, 1, \cdots)$.

*Remark:*
The generating function counts all (possibly) disconnected covers.
Example: $\mathrm{Cov}(\wait)$ counts all unramified covers, and $\phi(C_1, \cdots C_s)$ counts connected covers.
These generating functions will end up being quasimodular.

**Definition**:
Set $H_d^1(C_1, \cdots, C_S) \subset H_d(C_1, \cdots, C_S)$ be the degree $d$ coverings *without* unramified components.

**Definition**:
Set $\mathrm{Cov}'(C_1, \cdots, C_S)= \sum q^d \frac{\abs{H_d^1(C_1, \cdots, C_s)}}{d!}$.

This yields the generating function for number of coverings without unramified components.

**Lemma**:
$\mathrm{Cov}' (C_1, \cdots, C_S) = \mathrm{Cov}(C_1, \cdots, C_S) / \mathrm{Cov}()$.

*Sketch of proof:*
Look at coefficients in the expansion

\begin{align*}
\abs{H_d(C_1, \cdots, C_S)} = \sum_{k=0}^d {d\choose k} \abs{H_k(C_1, \cdots , C_S)} \cdot \abs{H_{d-k}()}
.\end{align*}

Recall that $\mathrm{Cov}_d(C_1, \cdots C_S)$ correspond to $S_d$ representations of $\pi_1(T\setminus Z)$, and we can get a presentation 
$$\pi_1(T\setminus Z) = \generators{\sigma, \gamma, g_i \suchthat [\omega,\gamma] \prod g_i = e}
.$$

> This just comes from doing one full loop around the outside square, which should be equivalent (up to orientation) to going around all 3 punctures.

**Definition:**
Conjugacy classes corresponds to partitions of $d$.

**Definition:**
For $C$ a conjugacy class correspond to a partition $\lambda'$ in $S_d$. 
For any partition $\lambda$, let $f_C(\lambda) = \# C \chi^\lambda(C) / \dim \lambda$, where $\chi^\lambda$ is the irreducible representation associated to $\lambda$ (note that this is a rescaling of a row of the character table, since irreducible reps happen to correspond to conjugacy classes for $S_d$).
This is a class function, so $\chi^\lambda(C)$ is its value on any $c\in C$, and $\dim \lambda \definedas \chi^\lambda(1)$.

**Proposition:**
$\mathrm{Cov}_d(C_1, \cdots, C_S) - \sum_{\abs \lambda = d} \prod_{i=1}^S f_{C_i}(\lambda)$.

*Proof:*
Let $\prod C_i = \prod \sum_{a_j\in C_i} a_j \in Z(\CC[S_d])$.
Why? Commutating elements reindexes the sum here.

We also have $\sum_{g, h} [g, h] \prod C_i \in Z(\CC([S_d]))$, since $[g ,h]^k = [g^k, h^k]$, which again just reindexes the sum.

We'll pull out a factor of $\frac 1 {d!} [\id]$, and consider what the coefficient of $[\id]$ is in the group algebra.

Thus $\frac{1}{d!} [\id] = \frac{1}{(d!)^2} \tr_{\text{reg}}\qty{ \sum [g, h] \prod C_i  }$, where we consider the regular representation: multiplying by elements of $g$ is a fixed-point free action, so these are traceless (no terms on the diagonal) whereas the trace of the identity is exactly the dimension of the regular representation, which is $d!$ (?).

Thus we define $\tr_{\text{reg}}(\wait) = \sum_{\lambda} (\dim \lambda) \tr_\lambda(\wait)$.

Note that $\rho: S_d \to \GL(V)$ extends to $\rho: \CC[S_d] \to \endo(V)$, and thus by Schur's Lemma, the image of the center will commute with every endomorphism.

We get a formula:

\begin{align*}
\frac{[\id]}{d!} 
&= \frac{1}{(d!)^2} \sum_{\abs \lambda = d} \dim \lambda \tr_{\lambda}(\sum [g, h] \prod_i C_i) \\
&= \sum_{\abs \lambda = d} \frac{(\dim \lambda)^2}{(\abs \lambda !)^2} W(\lambda) \tr_\lambda(\prod C_i)
.\end{align*}

where $W(\lambda)$ is a scalar $\sum [g, h]$ by the above observation.

Recall that $f_c(\lambda) = \# C \frac{\chi^\lambda(C)}{\dim \lambda}$ and thus

\begin{align*}
\frac{[\id]}{d!} = \sum_{\abs \lambda = d} \qty{\frac{\dim \lambda}{\abs \lambda}}^2 W(\lambda) \prod f_{C_i}(\lambda)
.\end{align*}

**Fact:**
$W(\lambda) = \qty{\frac{\abs \lambda !}{\dim \lambda}}^2$.

## Quasimodularity

**Fact:**
The functions $f_C(\lambda)$ are polynomial functions in the following way:

**Definition:**
Let $\Lambda^*(n)$ be the algebra of "shifted symmetric functions", i.e. symmetric functions in the $\lambda_i - i$.

> Subtlety: it's necessary to order to partition in weakly decreasing order of the numbers occurring!
> Example: $p(\lambda) = (\lambda_1 - 1)(\lambda_2 - 2)$, but swapping $\lambda_1 \iff \lambda_2$ results in $((\lambda_2 - 2) + 1)((\lambda_1 - 1) - 1)$ is no longer symmetric in $\lambda_i - i$.

Then define $\Lambda^* = \lim_{\from} \Lambda^*(n)$.

> Schur-Weyl duality: bijects representations of $\GL_n$ and $S_n$.

Then $f_c \in \Lambda^*$ and the degree of $f_C$ is exactly the number of non-fixed points of any permutation from $C$.

From the paper,

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Cov}(C_1, \cdots, C_S) &= \sum_\lambda q^{\abs \lambda} \prod_i f_{C_i}(\lambda) \\
\mathrm{Cov}() &= \sum a^{\abs \lambda} = \qty{ \prod_{n\geq 1} 1-q^n }\inv = (q)_\infty\inv
.\end{align*}

> Note: the partition functions appears!

For any $F\in \Lambda^*$, we set $\generators{F}_q = (q)_\infty \sum_\lambda q^{\abs \lambda} F(\lambda)$ and 
$$
\generators{F_1 \mid F_2 \mid \cdots \mid F_S}_q = \sum_{\alpha\in \pi_S} (-1)^{\phi(\alpha) - 1} (\phi(\alpha) - 1)! \prod_{k=1}^{\phi(\alpha)} \generators{\prod_{i\in\alpha_j} F_i}_q
.$$

> This comes from Möbius inversion, and is a form of inclusion-exclusion.

**Proposition:**
$\mathrm{Cov}'(C_1, \cdots, C_S) = \generators{f_{C_1} \cdots f_{C_S}}_q$ and $\phi(C_1, \cdots, C_S) = \generators{f_{C_1} \mid \cdots \mid f_{C_S}}_q$.

**Theorem:**
For all $F\in \Lambda^*$, $\generators{F}_q$ is a quasimodular form, i.e in $\CC[E_2, E_4, E_6]$ where $E_i(q) = \const + \sum \sigma+{i-1} (n) q^n$.

Then $\sigma$ is determined by the representation $\pi_1(T\setminus Z, \ast) \to \Aut(\sigma\inv(\ast)) \cong S_d$ if $\sigma$ is a degree $d$ cover.

# Thursday January 23rd

## Counting Square Tiled Surfaces 
Square tiled surfaces in $\mch(k)$ with $d$ squares correspond to degree $d$ branched covers of the identification square, branched over the origin, with profile (?).

To count square-tiled surfaces: label squares, look at inverse images of $\ast$ by $\theset{1 ,\cdots, d}$.
Consider the monodromy representation $\rho: \pi_1( \TT \setminus \theset{0}, \ast ) \to S_d$ where $\sigma = \rho(\alpha) = (1)(23)$ and $\tau = \rho(\beta) = (12)(3)$.
We compute ramification orders by considering the commutators $[\alpha, \beta]$.
Then $\rho([\alpha, \beta] )$ has cycle type $(1, 1, \cdots 1, 1+k, \cdots, 1+ k_n)$.
Note that $[(23), (12)]$ is a 3 cycle.

![Image](figures/2020-01-23-14:32.png)\

**Conclusion:**
The number of square-tiled surfaces in $\mch(k)$ with $d$ squares is exactly 
$$
\frac{1}{d!} \abs{\theset{\sigma, \tau \in S_d \suchthat [\sigma, \tau] \in C_{1, \cdots, 1, 1+k, \cdots, 1+ k_n}}}
.$$

Note that the division is due to the artificial labeling of squares.

**Main theorem from "Branched Covers of Torus" Paper:**
The generating function 
$$
f_\kappa(q)\definedas \sum_{d\geq 1} \#\theset{\text{Square tiled, $d$ squares in $\mch(k)$}} q^d
$$ 
is a **modular form**.

Follows from taking $q = e^{2\pi i \tau}$ which is holomorphic on $\HH$ the upper half-plane, satisfying a transformation rule with respect to $\tau \mapsto -1/\tau$, which is a finite-dimensional space.

> Actual: quasimodular mixed form.

The weights are bounded by $\abs \kappa + \ell(\kappa)$.

Concretely, $f_\kappa \in \QQ[E_2, E_4, E_8]$ where $E_k(q) = \text{const} + \sum_{d \geq 1} \sigma_{k-1}(d) q^d$, where $\sigma_{k-1}(d) = \sum_{e\mid d} e^{k-1}$.
This is the ring of quasimodular forms.

- $1$ is weight 0,
- $E_2$ is weight 2,
- $E_2^2, E_4$ are weight 4,
- $E_2^3, E_2 E_4, E_6$ are weight 6, etc

*Example:*
Take $\kappa = \theset{2} \iff \mch(2)$, then $\abs \kappa + \ell(\kappa) = 3$ and $f_{\theset z}(q) = c_1 + c_2 E_2(q)$.
In this case $[q^1] = [q^2] = 0$.

Note that surfaces in $\mch(2)$ have 1 vertex of cone angle $6\pi$ and all others of angle $2\pi$, corresponding to an abelian differential with a single zero of order 2.

A special type of square-tiled surfaces: 1 cylinder surfaces, where $\rho(\alpha)$ is a full length cycle.

This is in $\mch(3, 1)$, and corresponding surface $(\Sigma, \omega)$, which is a holomorphic 1-form with a triple zero and a single zero.
By Riemann-Hurwitz, $2g-2 = \deg \omega = 3+1 \implies g = 3$.

> Note: the genus here difficult to compute otherwise!


**Main Result of 1-Cylinder Surface Paper:**
1-cylinder surfaces have roughly a $1/d$ proportion in all square tiled surfaces, where $d = \dim \mch(\kappa)$.

Recall that we can get a square tiled surface from any unicursal curve:

![Image](figures/2020-01-23-14:41.png)\

Note that these aren't always translation surfaces:

![Image](figures/2020-01-23-14:43.png)\

This has transition maps that looks like $z \mapsto i^k z + z_0 = w$ and thus $dz = i^k dw$, so $dz^k$ is the well-defined object here.

Recall

- $(\Sigma, dz) \iff$ translation surfaces
- $(\Sigma, (dz)^2) \iff \frac 1 2 \dash$translation surfaces
- $(\Sigma, (dz)^4) \iff \frac 1 4\dash$translation surfaces
  - I.e. a Riemann surface with a section of $K_\eps^{\tensor 4}$. 


Can consider a *tricursal* curve instead (a curve that requires lifting the pen 3 times).
Taking the dual complex yields a cube. 

![Image](figures/2020-01-23-14:52.png)\

This has charts $w = z^{4/3}$ and thus $(dz)^4 = w\inv (dw)^4$.
Let $\mch(\kappa)$ be the quartic differentials with $dv \omega = \sigma \kappa_i p_i$.
Then the cube is in $\mch_4(-1, \cdots -1)$ with $8$ copies of $-1$.

This gives cone angles $n \frac{2\pi}{4}$ and the order of the zero/pole is $n-4$.

This example is in $\mch_4(-3, -3, -2)$.

**Proposition:**
The generating functions for square-tiled surfaces $\mch_4(\kappa)$ is now a quasimodular form for $\Gamma_1(4)$.

## Open Questions

**Question (can find numerical evidence?):**
How can we count these in terms of the symmetric group? 
Analogous result to proportion result earlier?
Can try to lift square example, but admits no map from a torus -- instead, quotient square by $\ZZ/4\ZZ$ and take fundamental domain.
What kind of branching do these covers have?

Every center of a square is branched of order 4.
Every center of an edge is branched of order 2.
The ramification order of a vertex is its valence, divided by the number of squares meeting at that vertex.
The degree of the covering map is $4n$ where $n$ is the number of squares.

Identify the fundamental domain with $\PP^1$,
We get a monodromy representation:

\begin{align*}
\rho: \pi_1(\PP^1 \setminus(0, 1,\infty), \ast) \to S_{4d} \\
\gamma_0 \mapsto \rho(\gamma_0)
.\end{align*}

Note that $\gamma_0 \gamma_1 \gamma_\infty = 1$.

It then follows that this has cycle type $(4, \cdots ,4)$.

So the number of square tiled surfaces in $\mch_4(\kappa)$ is given by

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{(4d)!} = \# \theset{ (\sigma_0, \sigma_1, \sigma_\infty) \suchthat \sigma_0 \in C_{4, \cdots, 4} (d), \sigma_1 \in C_{2, \cdots ,2} (2d), \sigma_{\infty} \in C_{4, \cdots ,4, 4+k, \cdots, 4 + k_n}, \sigma_0 \sigma_1 \sigma_\infty = 1}
.\end{align*}

Would be nice to figure out what the proportionality constant here is.

## Correspondence

**Recall:**
Start with a translation surface with cone points with angles $2\pi n i$.
This yields a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ and a holomorphic $1\dash$form $\omega$ with zeros of order $n_i -1$.

Given a square fundamental domain, there is an order 4 automorphism given by rotating 90 degrees.
In charts, this is multiplication by $i$ and possibly a translation, which is a holomorphic map $f: \Sigma \selfmap$.
We then have $f^*(dz) = d(f(z)) = idz$, so $dz$ is an eigenvector for $f^*$.

An elliptic curve can be specified by $y^2 = f_4(x)$ for a degree 4 polynomial, so we can obtain it as a double branched cover of $S^2$.
(i.e. glue along the slits joining pairs of roots)

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-21:56.png)\

Take $E : y^2 = x^4 - 1$, this is the only elliptic curve with an order 4 automorphism.
In coordinates, this is generated by $(x, y) \mapsto (-ix ,y)$.
So $\omega = c \frac{dx}{y}$, i.e. $dx/y$ up to scaling, and $f^*(dx/y) = i \frac{dx}{y}$.
What is the constant $c$?

Take closed cycles on $E$ given by $\alpha, \beta$ (see diagram), then by FTC $\int_\alpha \omega = z \mid_0^1 = 1$.
Negation is 4 fixed points on the elliptic curve, the 2-torsion points.

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-21:55.png)\

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-21:57.png)\

We can then compute

\begin{align*}
I = \int_\alpha  \frac{dx}{y} = \int_1^2 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^4 - 1}} 
.\end{align*}

and since $2c I = 1$, this uniquely determines $c$.

> Note that this can be numerically evaluated, but this is an elliptic integral with (possibly) no elementary antiderivative.

Consider the decagon with sides identified.
We get a complex structure $(\Sigma, \omega)$ with cone angles $4\pi$ and $dz$ has 2 zeros of order 1 (namely the two cone points).

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-21:58.png)\

What is the genus?
The degree of the canonical bundle is 
$$
g(\Sigma) = \deg K_\Sigma = 2g - 2 = \sum_{p\in \Sigma}\ord_p \omega
$$ 
and thus $g = 2$.

**Fact:**
Every genus 2 curve is a double branched cover of $\PP^1$ branched over 6 points.

> Use Riemann-Roch.

Consider automorphisms that preserve the decagon.
Rotation by $\pi/10$ swaps the two cone points, to take rotation by $-2\pi/5$ (inserting the negative to account for pullbacks).
Then $f^* \omega = \zeta_5 \omega$, where again we just write locally $z \mapsvia{f} \zeta_5\inv + c \implies f^* dz = \zeta_5 dz$.

Consider points of order $5$ on $\PP^1$, we can take $\zeta_5^k$ and $\infty$.

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-21:58.png)\

This corresponds to the curves $y^2 = x^5 - 1$, with an automorphism $(x, y) \mapsto (\zeta_5 x, y)$.
This is the only genus 2 curve with an order 5 automorphism.

**Fact:**
The space of sections of the canonical $H^0(K_{\mathcal E}) = \CC^g$.

We can write a basis for the space of 1-forms: $\frac{dx}{y}$ and $(1-x) \frac{dx}{y}$.
Alternatively, $\omega = (a+bx) \frac{dx}{y}$ where $a, b \in \CC$.
What are the zeros of $\omega$?
$V(\omega) = V(a + bx)$ where if $b=0$ it's $\infty$.
Because this has to preserve the order 5 symmetric and map cone points to themselves, this forces $\omega = bx \frac{dx}{y}$, which has exactly two zeros: $(x, y) = (0, \pm i)$.

We can also consider the doubled pentagon, which has only one point.
This has an automorphism given by rotating each pentagon by $1/5$, it has cone angle $6\pi$, and $\omega$ has a double zero at the cone point.
Since there is only *one* genus 2 curve with order 5 automorphisms, this yields the previous Riemann surface but a distinct translation surface and a distinct form.

We can write $\alpha = a \frac{dx}{y}$.

**Proposition:**
One Riemann surface has many translation structures, and the space of such structures is the space of 1-forms.

*Proof:*
Pick a chart $w: U \to \CC$ avoiding the zeros of $\omega$.
Then $\omega = f(z) ~dz$ in this chart, and we want to compose with a biholomorphism $x$ to obtain a new chart $z$ such that $\omega = dz$ in this chart.
We can solve $dz = e = f(w) ~dw$ and $\frac{dz}{dw} = f(w)$ and by integrating we get $z(w) = \int_{p_0}^w f(w_0) dw_0$.
In this chart, $\omega = dz$, and we can correct near zeros by finding charts such that $\omega = z^n dz$ where $n$ is the order of the zero.

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-21:59.png)\

What does this buy us?
We get a translation structure by considering transitions, and $\omega = dz_1 = dz_2 \implies z_1 = z_2 + c$, which is exactly a translation structure.
Thus every $(\Sigma, \omega)$ has a translation structure for which $\omega = dz$ in local polygonal charts.

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-22:00.png)\

**Theorem:**
There is a bijection 

\begin{align*}
\correspond{\text{Translation surfaces with cone angles $2\pi n i$ }} \iff
\correspond{\text{$(\Sigma, \omega)$ a Riemann surface with holomorphic}\\ \text{1-forms with zeros of order $n_i - 1$}}
.\end{align*}

What do half-translations correspond to?
Note that $dz \mapsto -dz$, so we don't get a well-defined holomorphic 1-form.

![Image](figures/2020-01-22-22:01.png)\

The fix? 
$(dz)^2$ is some well-defined object. 
What is it?

The set $\theset{f(z) (dz)^2 = g(w)(dw)^2}$ corresponds with line bundles with transition functions given by $(dz/dw)^2$.

Thus the correspondence is 

\begin{align*}
\correspond{\text{Half translation surfaces with cone angle $\pi n_i$}}
\iff
\correspond{\text{Riemann surfaces with $q$ a section of $K_\Sigma^{\tensor 2}$ }}
.\end{align*}

I.e., these correspond with sections of the second tensor power of the canonical bundle of $\Sigma$.

A defining property of $q = (dz)^2$ for half-translation charts $z$: we can measure the order of the zero by going to charts, finding a chart to $\CC$ (see image) e.g. $w = z^{2/3}$, and then defining 
$$
\omega = dz = d(w^{3/2}) = 3/2 w^{1/2} dw
$$

Then $q = w^2 = (dz)^2$ is well-defined and equal to $\frac{9}{4} w (dw)^2$ in the local chart $w$. 

In this case, we get points that are *poles* of order 1 for the quadratic differential (sections of $K^{\tensor 2})$.

> Note: 1-forms are referred to as "abelian differentials" in the literature.

We know that $K_{\PP^1} = \mathcal O(-2)$ and $K_{\PP^1}^{\tensor 2} = \mathcal O(-4)$.

## Moduli Spaces

**Definition:**
$\mathcal{H}(k_1, \cdots, k_n) = \theset{ \Sigma \text{ with abelian differential}  \div \omega = \sum k p_i}$ where the $k_i$ record the orders of zeros of $\omega$.

> Second condition on divisor records zeros.

Similarly, define $Q(k_1, \cdots, k_n) = \theset{\cdots \suchthat \text{quadratic differential}}$ where now $k_i \geq -1, \neq 0$.

These moduli spaces are called *strata of abelian/quadratic differentials*.

Consider $M_g$, the moduli space of genus $g$ surfaces.
There is a vector bundle (the Hodge bundle) over $M_g$ where the fiber over $[c]$ is $H^0(K_C)$ with strata given by $Q$.

This is a bundle of rank $g$, and by Riemann-Roch, ? $3g-3$ and is the (co?)tangent bundle of something.

There is an $\SL(2, \RR)$ action on any stratum.
How to define -- use isomorphism with translation structures (see image) by just applying any such form $\gamma$ to the entire plane and gluing polygons in the same way.
This gives a non-holomorphic action on any stratum.

> Next time: to special case of square tiled surfaces.

# Thursday, Week 1 

**Motivation:** 
Gauss' Unicursal Problem.
How many distinct curves $\alpha: [0, 1] \to \RR^2$ are there with no triple crossings?

Note that if we compactify the plane to the Riemann sphere (and possibly take the curve to be piecewise linear) then we obtain a *tiling* of the sphere.
We can also take a *dual tiling* by taking the barycenters of each polygon and connecting them by an edge iff their corresponding polygons share an edge.

**Definition:**
A *translation surface* is the 2-dimensional topological manifold obtained by taking any set of polygons in $\RR^2$ and gluing their edges by translations.

*Example:*
Any elliptic curve (topologically a torus) is a translation surface.

We take equivalence up to cutting, pasting, and rearranging.

**Lemma:**
Two elliptic curves (of genus 2) are isomorphic iff the translation surfaces differ by a homothety, i.e. a rotation and scaling.

> Note: we will eventually see that the data of a translation surface is equivalently a holomorphic 1-form.

**Definition:**
A *half-translation surface* is a translation surface where we now additionally allow gluing by rotations of $\pi$ radians.

*Example:*

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
		\node[fill=black, shape=circle]  (0) at (-3, 3) {};
		\node[fill=black, shape=circle]  (1) at (3, 3) {};
		\node[fill=black, shape=circle]  (2) at (-3, -3) {};
		\node[fill=black, shape=circle]  (3) at (3, -3) {};
		\node[fill=black, shape=circle]  (4) at (0, 3) {};
		\node[fill=black, shape=circle]  (5) at (0, -3) {};
		\draw (1.center) to node [auto] {$a$} (3.center);
		\draw (0.center) to node [left] {$a$} (2.center);
		\draw (0.center) to node [above] {$b$} (4.center);
		\draw (4.center) to node [above] {$b$} (1.center);
		\draw (2.center) to node [below] {$c$} (5.center);
		\draw (5.center) to node [below] {$c$} (3.center);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

> Note that the gluing $b$ now requires a rotation.

By gluing edges with matching letters, we get a "hot pocket" surface:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
		\node [style=none] (0) at (-3, 3) {};

		\node [style=none] (9) at (3, -2.75) {};
		\draw (0.center) to (2.center);

		\draw [bend right] (8.center) to (9.center);
		\draw[dotted] [bend left=15] (8.center) to (9.center);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

**Lemma:**
Any game of *rectangular billiards* yields a half-translation surface.

Given any domain for rectangular billiards, we inflate it to a surface:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
		\node [style=none] (0) at (-5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (2) at (0, 0) {};
		\node [style=none] (3) at (0, 4) {};
		\node [style=none] (4) at (3, 4) {};
		\node [style=none] (5) at (3, 2) {};
		\node [style=none] (6) at (6, 2) {};
		\node [style=none] (7) at (6, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (8) at (-5, 0) {};
		\node [style=none] (9) at (-2.5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (10) at (-2.5, 0) {};
		\node [style=none] (11) at (1.5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (12) at (1.5, 4) {};
		\node [style=none] (13) at (4.5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (14) at (4.5, 2) {};
		\draw (0.center) to (8.center);
		\draw (8.center) to (2.center);
		\draw (2.center) to (3.center);
		\draw (3.center) to (4.center);
		\draw (4.center) to (5.center);
		\draw (5.center) to (6.center);
		\draw (6.center) to (7.center);
		\draw (0.center) to (7.center);
		\draw [bend right] (9.center) to (10.center);
		\draw[dotted] [bend left=15] (9.center) to (10.center);
		\draw [bend right=40] (11.center) to (12.center);
		\draw[dotted] [bend left=40, looseness=0.75] (11.center) to (12.center);
		\draw [bend right, looseness=0.75] (13.center) to (14.center);
		\draw[dotted] [bend left=15] (13.center) to (14.center);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

We can then cut along everything but the bottom edge to "unwrap" it into a half-translation surface:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
		\node [style=none] (0) at (-5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (2) at (0, 0) {};
		\node [style=none] (3) at (0, 4) {};
		\node [style=none] (4) at (3, 4) {};
		\node [style=none] (5) at (3, 2) {};
		\node [style=none] (6) at (6, 2) {};
		\node [style=none] (7) at (6, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (8) at (-5, 0) {};
		\node [style=none] (9) at (-2.5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (10) at (-2.5, 0) {};
		\node [style=none] (11) at (1.5, 6) {};
		\node [style=none] (12) at (1.5, 4) {};
		\node [style=none] (13) at (4.5, 6) {};

		\draw (4.center) to (5.center);
		\draw (5.center) to (6.center);
		\draw (6.center) to (7.center);
		\draw (0.center) to (7.center);

		\draw (22.center) to (23.center);
		\draw (23.center) to (29.center);
		\draw (29.center) to (24.center);
		\draw (24.center) to (18.center);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Some questions related to rectangular billiards:

**Question 1:**
Given a random starting point and direction, what proportion of the total region is traversed?
Will the trajectory entire a given region?
How long does the billiard spend in any given region?

**Theorem:**
The percentage of time spent in a given region is equal to the proportion of its area to the total area.

> This requires some ergodic theory.

**Question 2:**
If you shine a laser from a given spot, is the entire region illuminated?

**Theorem:**
No! There is a counterexample with 18 sides.
Moreover, no positive-area region can be avoided, but certain finite sets can.

**Definition:**
A *flat surface* is a generalization of translation surfaces that now allows gluing by any isometry of $\RR^2$.

*Example:*
A cube in $\RR^3$ is a flat surface, noting that the planar gluing diagram for it now requires rotations of $\pi/2$ radians:

![Image](figures/2020-01-11-22:16.png)\

Note that we can form higher genus surfaces using polygon gluing:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={fill=black,shape=circle,scale=0.5},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
		\node[style=none] (0) at (-0.75, 2.5) {};
		\node [style=none] (1) at (0.75, 2.5) {};
		\node [style=none] (2) at (-1.75, 1.25) {};
		\node [style=none] (3) at (1.75, 1.25) {};
		\node [style=none] (4) at (-1.75, -0.25) {};
		\node [style=none] (5) at (1.75, -0.25) {};
		\node [style=none] (6) at (-0.75, -1.5) {};
		\node [style=none] (7) at (0.75, -1.5) {};
		\node [style=none] (8) at (-1.75, 1.25) {};
		\draw (0.center) to node [auto] {$d$}  (8.center);
		\draw (8.center) to node [auto] {$a$}  (4.center);
		\draw (4.center) to node [auto] {$b$}  (6.center);
		\draw (6.center) to node [auto] {$c$}  (7.center);
		\draw (7.center) to node [auto] {$d$}  (5.center);
		\draw (5.center) to node [auto] {$a$}  (3.center);
		\draw (3.center) to node [auto] {$b$}  (1.center);
		\draw (1.center) to node [auto] {$c$}  (0.center);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

**Exercise:** 
Check that there is only one vertex in this polygon.

In general, the vertices may have total angle greater than $2\pi n$.
We refer to these as *cone points*, and the total angle as the *cone angle*.

**Exercise:**
Check that the cone angle in the above example is $6\pi$ by taking a loop around the cone point.

> Note on a weird phenomenon: it seems difficult to find $\ZZ^2$ or $\QQ^2$ points on the sloped edges of a regular polygon, based on computer drawings.

*Remark:*
This flat surface admits charts to $\CC$ with the following transition functions.
Let $P$ denote the single cone point.

Then there is a 3-fold cover give by the following space, thought of as a singular helical

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={fill=black,shape=circle,scale=0.5},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
	\draw (0, 0) circle (3cm);
	\node [style=none, label=P] (0) at (0, 0) {};
	\node [style=none] (1) at (3, 0) {};
	\draw (0.center) to node [above] {$C$} node [below] {$A$} (1.center);

	\draw (0, -7) circle (3cm);
	\node [style=none, label=P] (0) at (0, -7) {};
	\node [style=none] (1) at (3, -7) {};
	\draw (0.center) to node [above] {$A$} node [below] {$B$} (1.center);

	\draw (0, -14) circle (3cm);
	\node [style=none, label=P] (0) at (0, -14) {};
	\node [style=none] (1) at (3, -14) {};
	\draw (0.center) to node [above] {$B$} node [below] {$C$} (1.center);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

which maps onto the unit disc in $\CC$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
	none/.style={fill=black,shape=circle,scale=0.5},
	dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
	\draw (0, 0) circle (3cm);

	\node [style=none, label=P] (P) at (0, 0) {};
	\node [style=none] (u1) at  ({1*360/3}: 3cm){};
	\node [style=none] (u2) at  ({2*360/3}: 3cm){};
	\node [style=none] (u3) at  ({3*360/3}: 3cm){};

	\draw (P) to (u1);
	\draw (P) to (u2);
	\draw (P) to (u3);

	\node [label=1] (u1) at  ({1*360/6}: 1.5cm){};	
	\node [label=2] (u1) at  ({3*360/6}: 1.5cm){};
	\node [label=3] (u1) at  ({5*360/6}: 1.5cm){};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The covering map from the former to the latter is given by $z\mapsto z^{\frac 1 3}$, which coincides with the fact that the cone angle at $P$ is $3(2\pi) = 6\pi$.

One can also imagine this space in $\RR^3$ with a projection onto the plane:
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.16,width=10cm,height=14cm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[trig format plots=rad,
		view={-40}{6*pi},
		colormap={adopted}{
			rgb255(0cm)=(219,0,70);
	    rgb255(1cm)=(55,70,170);
			rgb255(2cm)=(219,0,70)
		},
		z buffer=sort,
		zmin=0]
\addplot3 [surf,domain=0.001:4,domain y=-pi/2:6*pi-pi/2,samples=25,samples y=40]
({x*cos(y)},{x*sin(y)},{ln(x)+y});
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Here the helicoid goes through three full twists, where the top and bottom pieces are identified.

**Proposition:**
In a neighborhood of a cone point $P$ with cone angle $2\pi n$, the map $z\mapsto z^{\frac 1 n}$ will be a local chart for any $z$ in a neighborhood of $P$.

This gives the resulting surface the structure of a *Riemann surface*, i.e. a surface admitting charts to $\CC$ with holomorphic transition functions.

Let $X$ be a Riemann surface, we can look at the *canonical bundle* over $X$ with sections that are compatible collections of $f_u(z_u) ~dz_u$ for each chart $z_u$, and for each such chart a holomorphic function $f_u(z_u)$ on $z_u(U)$ where on overlaps

\begin{align*}
f_u(z_u) ~dz_u &= f_v(z_v) ~dz_v \\
&= f_v(z_v \circ z_u) z_v'(z_u) ~dz_u
.\end{align*}

**Updated Definition:**
A *translation surface* is a Riemann surface with a section of its canonical bundle.

*Example:*
$C/\Lambda$ for $\Lambda$ any rank-2 lattice:

![Image](figures/2020-01-11-23:35.png)

> Note that the translation here is given by $\vector \lambda$.

**Definition:**
A holomorphic 1-form is a section of the canonical bundle.

*Example:*
For the above surface, we have $z_v = z_u + \vector \lambda$ and thus $dz_u = dz_v$ is nonvanishing.

Note that $dz$ is a holomorphic 1-form on the complement of the vertex/vertices of the polygon.

**Proposition:**
$dz$ extends holomorphically to charts containing cone points with cone angle $2\pi n$ and has a zero of order $n-1$ at such cone points.

*Example:*
For the chart $z=w^3$ where $w$ is the local coordinate, we have $dz = 3w^2$, yielding a zero of order 2.

**Definition:**
A map $\pi: \Sigma \to \Sigma'$ of Riemann surfaces is said to be *ramified* at a point $p\in \Sigma'$ iff in local charts $\pi$ has the form $z\mapsto z^n$ for some $n>1$.

> I.e. all points in a punctured neighborhood of $\pi(p)$ have $n$ preimages.

**Definition:**
If $\pi$ is ramified at $p$, the number of preimages $n$ is referred to as $e_p$, the *ramification index of $p$*.

*Fact:*
$\vector{\beta}(\Sigma_g) = [1, 2g, 1, 0, \cdots]$ and $\chi(\Sigma) = 2-2g$.

**Theorem:**
If $\pi$ is an unramified covering map of degree $n$, then $\chi(\Sigma') = n\chi(\Sigma)$.

**Theorem (Riemann-Hurwitz):**
If $\pi: \Sigma \to \Sigma'$ is a ramified covering map of degree $N$, then

\begin{align*}
\chi(\Sigma') = N \chi(\Sigma) - \sum (e_p - 1) \quad\text{ i.e. } 2 g(\Sigma') - 2=  N(2g(\Sigma) - 2)  + \sum (e_p - 1)
.\end{align*}

*Another useful form:*
Let $r \in \Sigma'$ be the number of ramification points, and $b$ the number of branch points, i.e. their images in $\Sigma$.
Then

\begin{align*}
\chi(\Sigma') = N(\chi(\Sigma) - b) + r
.\end{align*}


**Holomorphic Forms:**
A holomorphic $p\dash$form on $X$ is a section of $\Lambda^p T\dual X$, the $p$th exterior power of the holomorphic cotangent bundle of $X$.

For $n = \dim_\CC X$, the $n\dash$forms are an important special case.
Any such form $w$ is given in local coordinates $(z_1, \cdots, z_n)$ by 

\begin{align*}
w = w(z_1, \cdots, z_n) dz_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dz_n
\end{align*}

for some holomorphic function $w: \CC^n \to ?$.

**Canonical Bundle:**
Given a complex manifold $M$, we can define the tangent bundle $\CC^n \to TM \to M$ and the cotangent bundle $\CC^n \to T\dual M \to M$, which we'll just denote $T\dual M$.
Then the canonical bundle is the bundle $\CC\to \Lambda^n T\dual M \to M?$, denoted by $\omega$, obtained by taking the $n$th exterior power.

It is a theorem that the fibers are in fact complex lines $\CC^1$.
For vector bundles, this is referred to as the *determinant bundle*.
If $M$ is a smooth manifold, then $\omega$ has a global section.

> Note: a holomorphic $n\dash$form is exactly the same as a section of the canonical bundle.

Interesting aside: a Calabi-Yau is a manifold with a nowhere vanishing holomorphic $n\dash$form, which implies that the canonical bundle admits a map to a trivial line bundle that is an isomorphism, i.e. the canonical bundle is trivial.

*Exercise:*
For $\Sigma_g$ a compact Riemann surface of genus $g$, the dimension of the space of holomorphic sections of the canonical bundle, i.e. the space of holomorphic differentials on $\Sigma_G$, is given by $\dim H^0(X; \Omega) = g$ (the genus of the surface).
Proof: use Riemann-Roch.

Classification of elliptic orbifolds of dimension 2:
Define $(n_1, \cdots; m_1, \cdots)$ as the *profile*, where $n_i$ are *elliptic* points (locally look like quotient by $\ZZ/n\ZZ$), and $m_i$ are *corner reflectors* (locally look like quotient by a dihedral group):

![Image](figures/2020-01-29-20:44.png)\


Conformal (or equivalently complex) structures on a genus $g$ surface form a moduli space $\MM_g$ of dimension $3g-3$ for $g > 1$.

Let $\alpha$ be any partition of $2g-2$, and $\mch(\alpha)$ the moduli space of pairs $(\Sigma_g, \omega)$ where $\Sigma_g$ is a Riemann surface of genus $g$ and $\omega$ is a holomorphic 1-form (Abelian differential) on $M$ with the orders of its zeros given by $\alpha$.
Letting $\mch$ be the moduli space of all abelian differentials on Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ is stratified by $\mch(\alpha)$ as $\alpha$ ranges over all partitions.
For flat tori, $\mch = \GL_+(2, \RR)/\SL(2, \ZZ)$.

For $\Sigma_g$ a Riemann surface, there is a formula (Gauss-Bonnet in the flat metric) relating the degrees of the zeros of a holomorphic 1-form to the genus:

\begin{align*}
\sum d_j = 2g-2
.\end{align*}

## Section  1

Flat surfaces are characterized as surfaces with a flat metric and (finitely many?) cone-like singularities.
These surfaces appear to be isomorphic to moduli spaces of holomorphic 1-forms.
It is profitable to study the orbit of the surface under the Teichmüller geodesic flow, as well as a $\GL_n$ action.

Some introductory surveys:

- A. Eskin [E], 
- G. Forni [For2], 
- P. Hubert and T. Schmidt [HuSdt5] 
- H. Masur [Ma7],
- H. Masur and S. Tabachnikov [MaT] 
- J. Smillie [S].


We usually associate

- Constant positive curvature = $S^2$
- Constant zero curvature = $S^1 \cross S^1 \definedas T^1 = \Sigma_1$
- Constant negative curvature = $\Sigma_g$ for $g\geq 2$, a surface of higher genus

**Proposition:**
Any surface can be given a flat metric, possibly introducing singular points.

> Idea: Push all of the curvature into a cone point.

*Example:*
The standard cube embedded in $\RR^3$.

This is a flat surface with 8 cone points located at the vertices.
Note that the metric is non-degenerate on the edges, since any neighborhood of a point on an edge is still homeomorphic to $\RR^2$:

![Image](figures/2020-01-11-23:54.png)

Any neighborhood of a vertex is isometric to the vertex of the usual notion of a cone.
The cone angle can be measured by cutting a cone from the base to the vertex, yielding a flat pattern that sits in $\RR_2$, and measuring the "missing" angle in the resulting circle:

![Image](figures/2020-01-12-00:00.png)

This shows that the cone angle of the cube is $3\pi/2$, which coincides with the fact that there are 3 square (and thus 3 right angles) adjacent to any cone point.

**Definition:**
Geodesic (todo)

**Definition:**
Ergodic (todo)

> Here this means that a typical geodesic will visit any region in phase space and time spent in a region is proportional to volume.


**Definition:**
Holonomy and Holonomy group (todo)

General (wildly open) problem:

- Describe the behavior of a generic geodesic on a surface
- Prove that the geodesic flow is ergodic on a typical flat surface
- Does almost every surface have a closed geodesic that does not pass through singular points?
  - If so, how many?
  - Find the (asymptotic) number of such closed geodesics of length shorter than $L$

This remains unsolved for $S^2$ with 3 singularities (equivalent to a certain billiards problem). 
It is not even known if any flat sphere admits a single closed geodesic.

Flat surfaces have nontrivial holonomy, which makes them resemble Riemannian manifolds more than flat tori.

If we take the surface and puncture the conical points, it is locally isometric to the punctured Euclidean plane.
This allows a notion of parallel transport of tangent vectors.

Parallel transports along homotopically trivial loops are always the identity; otherwise, for homotopically nontrivial loops this rotates the vector by some angle.
Parallel transport around a cone point rotates by exactly the cone angle.
Nontrivial holonomy forces geodesics to self-intersect many times.

> Exercise: parallel transport a vector around the cone point of a cube.

The flat torus has trivial linear holonomy -- all geodesics either close up, or never self-intersect and produce a dense winding path.

**Definition:**
A translation surface is closed orientable surface with a flat metric, a finite number of conical singularities, and trivial linear holonomy.

Note that trivial linear holonomy implies that cone angles are all integer multiples of $2\pi$.

> Convention: we assume all flat surfaces come with a distinguished direction.

Remark:
Billiards gives rise to a flat surface with nontrivial linear holonomy. 

**Definition:**
A half-translation surface is a surface with a flat metric and holonomy group $\ZZ/(2)$.

> In this case, a vector $\vector v$ may come back as $-\vector v$ after parallel transport.

We'll often consider families of flat surface sharing the same genus and number/type of conical singularities.
These will correspond to strata of moduli spaces of one-forms.

It will often be useful to let $\SL(2, \RR)$ act on these families, consider the orbits, and take its closure.

Central problem / conjecture:
Taking the closure of an orbit under the action of $\GL^+(2, \RR)$ is a complex subvariety, so both the moduli space of holomorphic one-forms and the moduli space of quadratic differentials resemble homogeneous spaces under the action of a unipotent group.

The there is a projection from these orbits (Teichmüller discs)  to the moduli space of complex structures (?), which will be denoted $\MM_g$.
It is well-known that moduli spaces are not homogeneous spaces, but the conjecture here is that they behave as if they were.

## Section 2: Motivations

Open problems in rectangular billiards:

1. Describe the behavior of a billiard trajectory in a generic triangle, and prove that the billiard flow is ergodic.
2. Does (almost) any table have at least one regular periodic trajectory? Is it preserved under deformations?
3. Asymptotically in length, how many periodic trajectories are there? 
4. Does any obtuse triangle have a single periodic trajectory?

*Known example:* 
Acute triangles have at least 1, see Fagnano trajectory 

*Fox-Kershner construction:*
Yields a way to go from billiard trajectories to geodesics on a flat surface.
General idea: glue two copies of the billiard table along the edge to get a flat sphere; then paths lift to geodesics.
Such surfaces are not "very flat", i.e. they have nontrivial linear holonomy.

# Monday, October 12: Audin Chapter 10 (From Floer to Morse)

## Notation and Setup

- $(W, \omega, J)$ a symplectic manifold with an almost complex structure

- $H\in C^\infty(W, \RR)$ will be either a Morse function or a Hamiltonian
- $X$ will be a vector field, potentially $X_H$, the symplectic gradient of $H$:
  \[  
  \omega_x(\wait , X_H(x)) = (dH)_x(\wait) 
  .\]


- $DH$ will denote differentials, $D^2 H$ will denote Hessians (where they're defined)

- $CM_*(H, J)$ will be the Morse complex associated with a Morse function $H$, its vector field $\grad H$ the gradient for the metric defined by $J, \omega$.

- $CF_*(H, J)$ will be the Floer complex

:::{.theorem title="Main Goal"}
There exists a nondegenerate Hamiltonian that is sufficiently small in the $C^2$ topology for which both the Floer and Morse complexes are well-defined, and 
\[  
CF_*(H, J) \cong CM_{*+n}(H, J) = CM_*(H, J)[n]
.\]
:::

## Strategy

Need to show two things:

1. $CF_* = CM_*[n]$, and
2. $\bd_F = \bd_M$.

### Equality of Complexes 

:::{.definition title="Nondegenerate 1: Critical Points of a Function"}
For a function $f \in C^\infty(W, \RR)$, define a bilinear form 
  \[
  (D^2 f)_p: T_p W \tensor T_p W &\to \RR \\
  (\vector v, \vector w) &\mapsto \inner{ \vector x}{(Y\cdot f)(p)}
  \] 
for some vector field $Y$ extending $\vector y$.

A critical point $p$ is **nondegenerate** iff $(D^2 f)_p$ is a nondegenerate quadratic form.
:::

:::{.definition title="Nondegenerate 2: Critical Points of Periodic Trajectories"}
For a Hamiltonian system $H$, a periodic solution $x$ is **nondegenerate** iff $1 \not\in \spec(d\psi_1)$, i.e. 1 is not an eigenvalue of the differential, i.e. 
\[
\det\qty{\id - \qty{D\psi^1}_{x(0)} } \neq 0
.\]
:::

:::{.example}
Motivation: 
  \[  
  H=\frac{1}{2} \sum a_{i j} p_{i} p_{j}+\sum b_{i j} p_{i} q_{j}+\frac{1}{2} \sum c_{i j} q_{i} q_{j} \implies X_H \vector p = A \vector p, A \approx D^2 H(0)
  .\]

Yields a flow $\psi_t = e^{tA}$, then if $\psi_1 = e^A$ doesn't have eigenvalue 1, $A$ doesn't have eigenvalue zero, and the quadratic form $H$ is nondegenerate, so the critical point of $H$ at zero is nondegenerate.
:::

:::{.proposition title="5.4.5"}
Definition 2 implies definition 1: if $x$ is a critical point of $H$ which is nondegenerate as a periodic solution of the Hamiltonian system, then $a \in \crit(H)$ is nondegenerate as a critical point of the *function* $H$.
:::

- Can start with an $H_0$ and rescale to define $H \da H_0/k$
- When $H$ sufficiently small in the $C^2$ sense (close sups of 1st and 2nd derivatives), the only periodic trajectories are constant
  - Use prop: def 2 implies def 1, conclude that $H$ is Morse.
  - As a result,
  \[  
  \crit(\mathcal{A}_H) \iff \crit(H) \iff \ts{\text{Constant trajectories}}
  .\]
  - Use remark 5.4.6: for the Hessian  of $H$, $\spec(D^2 H) \intersect 2\pi \ZZ = \emptyset$
  - Yields *Index Comparison Formula*: 
  \[  
  \ind_H(x) = \mu(x) + n
  .\]


**Goal by end of Ch. 10**:

- Show that all Floer solutions connecting two consecutive critical points are *also* Morse trajectories, 
- Regularity: $d\mathcal{F}_u$ is surjective along these trajectories
  - Implies $\mathcal{M}^{(H, J)}(x, y)$ is a manifold, allows defining Floer complex

- Index Comparison Formula **yields equality of vector spaces**, up to a dimension shift.

\newpage


### Equality of Differentials

- Next need to show both differentials $\bd_M, \bd_F$ can be defined, and they coincide

- Defining $\bd_M$:
  - Need a vector field $X$ adapted to $H$
  - $X$ needs to satisfy Smale condition (genericness)

- Recall the **Smale Condition**: all stable and unstable manifolds of critical points meet transversely,
\[  
W^{\text{u}}(a) \transverse W^{\text{v}}(b) \qquad\forall a, b\in \crit(H)
.\]

![LHS: violates Smale condition. RHS: okay!](figures/image_2020-10-12-15-19-17.png)

- Goal: given fixed data for the Floer theory, relate it to Morse data (define the Morse complex).

- Strategy: running ideas backwards, getting theorems for Morse functions similar to what we did when linearizing the Floer operator

### Define Morse Differentials

- To define $\bd_M$: need to relate trajectories of $X$ to solutions of Floer equation:
\LARGE
\[  
\correspond{ \text{Solutions to } \\ \\ \dd{u}{s} + X(u) = 0  }
\iff
\correspond{ \text{Solutions to } \\ \\ \dd{u}{s} + J(u) \dd{u}{t} + \grad H(u) = 0 }
.\]
\normalsize

  To do this: need $X = \grad H$ for the metric induced by $J, \omega$.


:::{.definition title="Pseudo-Gradient"}
For $f:W\to \RR$ a Morse function, a vector field $X$ is a **pseudo-gradient** for $f$ iff

1. $(Df)_p(X_p) \leq 0$ with equality iff $p\in \crit(f)$
2. In a Morse chart about $p\in \crit(f)$, we have $X = -\grad_g f$ for the canonical metric $g$ on $\RR^n$.
:::

:::{.definition title="Morse-Smale Pair"}
A pair $(f, X)$ of a function and a vector field is a **Morse-Smale pair** iff $f$ is Morse and $X$ is a pseudo-gradient for $f$ satisfying the Smale condition.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Theorem to Prove"}
Let $H$ be Morse on $(W, \omega)$.
Then there exists a dense subset $\mathcal{J}_{\text{reg}}(H)$ of almost complex structures $J$ calibrated by $\omega$ such that $(H, -JX_H)$ is Morse-Smale.

> Note: transversality result analogous to ones in 8.5
:::


:::{.proof}
\hfill

- Proof in two steps:

  - Step 1: Morse Side, arbitrary morse functions
    - Linearize the Morse equation $\dd{u}{s} + X(u) = 0$ of the flow of $-X$ along one of its solutions $L_u Y = 0$.
    - Show that whenever $H$ is Morse and $u$ is a trajectory connecting critical points, $L_u$ is Fredholm and 
  \[\ind(L_u) = \ind_H(y) - \ind_H(x).\]
    - Show that for $H$ a nondegenerate Hamiltonian and $u$ a trajectory of $JX_H$, the operators $(d\mathcal{F})_u$ and $L_u$ are Fredholm of equal index.
    - Show that $X$ is Smale $\iff$ $L_u$ is surjective.
  - Step 2: Floer Side, specific case of Hamiltonian
    - Prove the actual result.
:::

- Now fix an almost complex structure to obtain a Smale vector field $X$

\newpage

### Compare solutions to Floer equation and trajectories of $X$

- Goal: for $\ind(x) - \ind(y)\leq 2$, get an equality
\[  
\correspond{\text{Trajectories of Floer equation} \\ \text{associated to }(H, J) \text{ connecting }x, y} 
\iff
\correspond{\text{Trajectories of the Smale } \\ \text{vector field } -JX_H}
.\]

- Solutions to Floer equation that *do not* depend on $t$ are precisely trajectories of $X = - \grad H$.

- Next show that elements in $\ker (d\mathcal{F}_u)$ do not depend on $t$.
- Corollary: $d\mathcal{F}_u$ is surjective along every trajectory of $\grad H$.
- Then show that replacing $H_k \da H/k$ for $k\gg 0$ preserves all critical points and all indices
- Punch line: all the solutions of the Floer equation that we need are time-independent.
  - Statement: For $k\gg 0$, solutions to the Floer equation for $H_k$ connecting $x\to y$ with $\ind(x) - \ind(y) \leq 2$ are independent of $t$.


## Summary

- Take $H_k$ for $k\gg 0$ and $J\in \mathcal{J}_{\text{reg}}$ (dense)
- Then when $\ind(x) - \ind(y) \leq 2$, trajectories of Floer equation for $(H, J)$ connecting critical points $x, y$ are trajectories of the Smale vector field $X = - JX_H$.
  - $x, y$ will be critical points for both $H$ and $\mathcal{A}_H$
- Regularity? The linearized Floer operator is surjective along these trajectories
- Implies that $\mathcal{M}^{(H, J)}(x, y)$ is a manifold, so $CF_*$ can be defined.
- Claim: this shows the differentials coincide, and we're done.

\newpage


## Linearizing the Morse Equation

- Let $f$ be morse on $V \injects \RR^m$ ($m\gg 0$) with adapted pseudo-gradient field $X$, then

\LARGE
\[  
\correspond{
\text{Trajectories} \\
\text{of } X
}
\iff
\correspond{
\text{Solutions of} \\
\dd{u}{s} + X(u(s)) = 0
}
.\]
\normalsize

- Fix a metric $g$ on $V$ such that $X = \grad_g f$.
- Define the space of solutions of finite energy:
\[  
E(u) &\da 
\int_\RR \norm{\dd{u}{s}}^2 \,ds \\
\mathcal{M} &\da \ts{
u \in C^\infty(\RR, V) \st \dd{u}{s} + \grad f = 0, \quad E(u) < \infty
}
.\]

- Then $\mathcal{M}$ is compact and equal to $\union_{x, y} \mathcal{M}(x, y)$, using the fact that if $V$ is compact, *all* trajectories are of finite energy

- Now go to coordinates and linearize the equation of the flow along the solution $u$ to get a linear differential equation

- Yields an equation
\[  
L_u: W^{1, 2}(\RR, \RR^{n}) &\to L^2(\RR, \RR^{n}) \\
Y &\mapsto \dd{Y}{s} + A(s) Y \da L_u Y
,\]
  where $A$ is a matrix limiting to $\grad_y^2 f$ and $\grad_x^2 f$ at $s= \pm \infty$

  - Limiting to Hessians of nondegenerate critical points will yield symmetric invertible matrices

  - We then consider $\ker L_u \subseteq \ker(d\mathcal{F}_u)$. 
    Note: we have exponential decay.

- Note: the space of solutions to equation linearized at $u$ is $T_u \mathcal{M}(x, y)$.

### Showing $L_u$ is Fredholm

- Bootstrapping: $Y\in \ker(L_u)$ in $W^{1, 2}$ is continuous, thus $C^1$, this $C^\infty$ and form a finite-dimensional vector space.

- Behavior at infinity: reduces to \[L_uY = 0 \iff \dd{Y}{s} = -AY\] where $A$ is a constant diagonal matrix
  - This is a linear system, so solutions are 
  \[
  Y(s) = e^{-As}Y(0)
  \quad\text{i.e.}\quad
  y_i(s) = y_i e^{- \lambda_i s}
  .\]

- Will prove that if $u$ is a trajectory of $\grad f$ connecting $x\to y$ then $L_u$ is Fredholm

  - Proof: involves bounding $W^{1, 2}$ norm of $Y$ by $L^2$ norms of $Y, L_u Y$.

  - Lots of integral estimates: Fourier transform, Plancherel, Cauchy-Schwarz

- Integral bound yields: $\dim \ker L_u < \infty$ and $\im L_u$ is closed.

- Lemma: $\dim \cok < \infty$.

  - Proof: computer kernel of adjoint \[L_u^* = -\dd{}{s} + A^*\] where the matrix is transposed.

  - Use the fact that \[Z\in \coker(L_u) \iff Z\in \ker(L_u^*),\] i.e. $L_u^* Z = 0$ in the sense of distributions

### Computing $\ind L_u$

- Unsurprisingly, will show $\ind(L_u) = \ind_f(x) - \ind_f(y)$.

- Ideas in proof:

  - Will choose two real numbers $\sigma, s$ to plug into $u$, and consider *resolvent*: map between tangent spaces to $V$ at $u(\sigma), u(s)$.
  - Look at the tangent spaces at $u(\sigma)$ of the stable and unstable manifolds will be the Floer complex
  \[  
  E^\text{u}(\sigma) \da T_{u(\sigma)} W^\text{u}(x) \\
  E^\text{s}(\sigma) \da T_{u(\sigma)} W^\text{s}(x) \\
  .\]
  - Then $\ker L_u$ is isomorphic to the intersection for all $\sigma$.

### Smale Condition

- Recall $X= \grad_g f$ for $g$ a metric.

- Statement: the vector field $X$ satisfies the Smale condition $\iff$ all $L_u$ are surjective.

:::{.proof}
\hfill

- $L_u$ is surjective $\iff \cok(L_u) = 0 \iff \ker(L_u^*)$ is injective
- This is equivalent to 
\[  
T_{u(\sigma)} W^\text{u}(x) +
T_{u(\sigma)} W^\text{s}(x) = T_{u(\sigma)} V
.\]
- This is exactly the transversality condition for the stable and unstable manifolds
  - We want this for all critical points
:::

## 10.4: Morse and Floer Trajectories Coincide


### Comparing Kernels

- Note $\ker(L_u) \subset \ker(d\mathcal{F}_u)$ since
\[  
\qty{ \dd{}{s} + S(s) }Y = 0 \implies
\qty{ \dd{}{s} + J\dd{}{t} + S(s) }Y = 0
,\]
  so just need to show reverse inclusion.


- Use a lemma: for $f: [0, 1] \to \RR$,
\[  
\norm{f}_{L^p([0, 1])} \leq
\norm{\dd{f}{t}}_{L^p([0, 1])}
,\]
  then apply this to $f(t) \da Y(s, t)$ and $p = 2$.

- Yields an equation
\[  
\norm{\dd{Y}{s} }_{L^2}^2 + \norm{\dd{Y}{t} }_{L^2}^2 \leq \sup_s \norm{S(s)}_{\text{op}}^2 \norm{Y}_{L^2}^2 
\implies
\norm{Y}^2_{L^2} \leq \sup_s \norm{S(s)}_{\text{op}} \norm{Y^2_{L^2}}
\]
  where the sup term being small forces $Y=0$.

### Trajectories are Independent of $t$ 

**WTS**: 
Trajectories of $H_k$ appearing in the Floer complex are exactly those appearing in the Morse complex.
I.e. proving 10.1.9

 
 Idea of proof:

- Contradiction: suppose there exists a sequence $n_k\to \infty$ with time-dependent solutions $u_{n_k}$ connecting $x\to y$ which solve the Floer equation

- Consider case where indices differ by $1$: using broken trajectories theorem, extract a subsequence converging to some $v\in \mathcal{M}(x, y, H)$.

  - Show $v$ doesn't depend on $t$

  - Since $d\mathcal{F}_v$ is surjective, $v$ is in a 1-dim component, and thus an isolated point of $\mathcal{L}(x, y)$

  - Get a contradiction from taking $k\gg 0$ and using 
  \[v_{n_k}(s, t) = v(s + \sigma_k, t) = v(s + \sigma_k),\] 
  which does *not* depend on time

- Consider case where indices differ by 2

  - Use Smale property of the gradient $-J X_H$ of $H$: trajectories $x\to y$ form a 2-manifold

  - Since trajectories are also in $\mathcal{M}(x, y, H)$, parameterizes a submanifold in a neighborhood of $v$.

- Show that convergence toward broken orbits in Morse setting corresponds to converges toward broken trajectories in Floer setting

- Use gluing from last chapter: $\hat{v}_{n_k} \in \im{\hat\phi}$ for $k\gg 0$, contradicting the fact that $v_{n_k}$ doesn't depend on $t$

**Strategy**:

> In the background, have a Hamiltonian $H: W\to \RR$.
> Basic idea: cook up a gradient flow.

1. Define the action functional $\mathcal{A}_H$ 
  
  > On an infinite-dimensional space, critical points are periodic solutions of $H$

2. Construct the chain complex (graded vector space) $CF_*$.

  > Uses analog of the *index* of a critical point.

3. Define the vector field $X_H$ using $-\grad \mathcal{A}_H$.

  > This will be used to define $\del$ later. 

4. Count the trajectories of $X_H$

5. Show finite-energy trajectories connect critical points of $\mathcal{A}_H$.

6. Show *Gromov Compactness* for space of trajectories of finite energy

7. Define $\del$ 

  > Uses another compactness property

8. Show space of trajectories is a manifold, plus analog of "Smale property"

9. \textbf{Show that} $\del^2 = 0$ using a gluing property

10. Show that $HF_*$ doesn't depend on $\mathcal{A}_H$ or $X_H$

11. Show $HF_* \cong HM_*$, and compare dimensions of the vector spaces $CM_*$ and $CF_*$.

**Ingredients**:

- $(W, \omega, J)$ with $\omega \in \Omega^2(W)$ is a symplectic manifold 
  - With $J: T_p W \to T_p W$ an almost complex structure, so $J^2 = -\id$.
- $H \in C^\infty(W; \RR)$ a Hamiltonian
  - $X_H$ the corresponding symplectic gradient.
  - Defined by how it acts on tangent vectors in $T_x M$:
  \[  
  \omega_x(\wait , X_H(x)) = (dH)_x(\wait) 
  .\]
  - Zeros of vector field $X_H$ correspond to critical points of $H$:
  \[  
  X_H(x) = 0 \iff (dH)_x = 0
  .\]
  - Take the associated flow, assumed 1-periodic:
  \[
  \psi^t \in C^\infty(W, W) \qquad \psi^1 = \id
  ,\] 
  - Critical points of $H$ are periodic trajectories.
  

- $u \in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; W)$ is a solution to the Floer equation.

- The Floer equation and its linearization:
\begin{align*}
\mcf(u) &= \dd{u}{s} + J \dd{u}{t} + \grad_u(H) = 0 \\
\qty{d\mcf}_u(Y) &= \dd{Y}{s} + J_0 \dd{Y}{t} + S\cdot Y \\ \\ \\
&Y\in u^* TW,~ S \in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; \endo(\RR^{2n}))
.\end{align*}

\newpage

- $\mcl W$ is the *free loop space* on $W$, i.e. space of contractible loops on $W$, i.e. $C^\infty(S^1; W)$ with the $C^\infty$ topology
  - Elements $x\in \mcl W$ can be viewed as maps $S^1\to W$.
  - Can extend to maps from a closed disc, $u: \bar \DD^2 \to M$.
  - Loops in $\mcl W$ can be viewed as maps $S^2\to W$, since they're maps $I\cross S^1\to W$ with the boundaries pinched:

  ![Loops in $\mcl W$](figures/image_2020-09-20-19-43-22.png)


- The action functional is given by
  \begin{align*}
  \mca_H: \mcl W &\to \RR\\
  x &\mapsto -\int_{\DD} u^* \omega + \int_0^1 H_t(x(t)) ~dt
  \end{align*}

  - Example: $W = \RR^{2n} \implies A_H(x) = \int_0^1 \qty{H_t ~dt - p~dq}$. 

  - A correspondence
  \[  
  \correspond{\text{Solutions to the } \\\text{Floer equation}}
  \iff
  \correspond{\text{Trajectories} \\ \text{of } \grad \mathcal{A}_H}
  .\]

- $x, y$ periodic orbits of $H$ (nondegenerate, contractible), equivalently critical points of $\mathcal{A}_H$.

\newpage

- Assumption of *symplectic asphericity*, i.e. the symplectic form is zero on spheres. 
  Statement: for every $u\in C^\infty(S^2, W)$,
\[  
\int_{S^2} u^* \omega = 0 \qtext{or equivalently} \inner{\omega}{\pi_2 W} = 0
.\]

- Assumption of *symplectic trivialization*: for every $u\in C^\infty(S^2; M)$ there exists a symplectic trivialization of the fiber bundle $u^* TM$, equivalently
\[  
\inner{c_1 TW}{\pi_2 W} = 0
.\]
  
  > Locally a product of base and fiber, transition functions are symplectomorphisms.


- Maslov index: used the fact that 
  - Every path in $\gamma: I\to \Sp(2n, \RR)$ can be assigned an integer coming from a map $\tilde \gamma: I \to S^1$ and taking (approximately) its winding number.

- $\mathcal{M}(x, y)$, the moduli space of contractible finite-energy solutions to the Floer equation connecting $x, y$.

  - After perturbing $H$ to get transversality, get a manifold 

    - Dimension:
    \[  
    \dim \mcm(x, y) = \mu(x) - \mu(y)
    .\]

  - How we did it: 
    - Describe as zeros of a section of a vector bundle over $\mathcal{P}^{1, p}(x, y)$ 

      (Banach manifold modeled on the Sobolev spaces $W^{1, p}$), 
    
    - Apply Sard-Smale to show $\mathcal{M}(x, y)$ is the inverse image of a regular value of some map.
  
  - Needed tangent maps to be Fredholm operators, proved in Ch. 8 and used to show transversality.
  
    - Showed $(d\mathcal{F})_u$ is a Fredholm operator of index $\mu(x) - \mu(y)$.

# 9.1 and Review

- Defined moduli space of (parameterized) **solutions**:
\[  
\mathcal{M}(x, y) &= \ts{\text{Contractible finite-energy solutions connecting }x, y } 
\\ \\
\mcm &= \ts{\text{\textbf{All} contractible finite-energy solutions to the Floer equation}} \\
&= \bigcup_{x, y} \mathcal{M}(x, y)
.\]

- The moduli space of (unparameterized) **trajectories** connecting $x, y$:
\[  
\mathcal{L}(x, y) \da \mathcal{M}(x, y) / \RR
.\]

  - Use the quotient topology, define sequentially:
  \[  
  \tilde u_n \converges{n\to\infty}\too \tilde u 
  \quad\iff\quad 
  \exists \ts{s_n}\subset \RR \text{ such that } u_n(s_n + s, \wait) \converges{n\to\infty}\too u(s, \wait)
  .\]

  - When $\abs{\mu(x) - \mu(y)} = 1$, get a compact 0-manifold, so the number of trajectories $$n(x, y) \da \# \mathcal{L}(x, y)$$ is well-defined.

- $C_k(H) \da \ZZ/2\ZZ[\ts{\text{Periodic orbits of } X_H \text{ of Maslov index } k }]$.

  - Finitely many since they are nondegeneracy implies they are isolated.

:::{.remark}
Some notation:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\RR \ar[r] & \mathcal{M}(x, z)\ar[d, "\pi"] \\
 & \mathcal{L}(x, z) \\
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Hats will generally denote maps induced on quotient.
:::


- Defined a differential
\[  
\del: C_k(H) &\to C_{k-1}(H) \\
x &\mapsto \sum_{\mu(y) = k-1} n(x, y) y \\ \\
n(x, y) &\da \# \ts{\text{Trajectories of } \grad \mathcal{A}_H \text{ connecting } x, y} \mod 2 \\
&= \# \mathcal{L}(x, y) \mod 2
.\]

- Examined $\del^2$:

\[  
\del^2: C_{k}(H) &\to C_{k-2}(H) \\
x &\mapsto \del(\del(x)) \\
&= \del \qty{\sum_{\mu(y) = \mu(x)-1} n(x, y) y} \\ \\
&= \sum_{\mu(y) = \mu(x) - 1} n(x, y) \del(y) \\ \\
&= \sum_{\mu(y) = \mu(x) - 1} n(x, y) \qty{\sum_{\mu(z) = \mu(y)-1} n(y, z) z} \\ \\
&= \sum_{\mu(y) = \mu(x) - 1} \,\,\sum_{\mu(z) = \mu(y)-1} n(x, y)  n(y, z) \,z \\
&= \sum_{\mu(z) = \mu(y) - 1} \qty{\sum_{\mu(y) = \mu(x)-1} n(x, y)  n(y, z)}\,z \hspace{4em} \text{(finite sums, swap order)}
,\]
  so it suffices to show
\[  
\sum_{\mu(y) = \mu(x)-1} n(x, y)  n(y, z) = 0 \qtext{when} \mu(z) = \mu(x) - 2 
.\]

  > Easier to examine parity, so we'll show it's zero mod 2.

\newpage

  - When $\mu(z) = \mu(x) - 2$, $\mathcal{L}(x, z)$ is a non-compact 1-manifold, so we compactify by adding in *broken trajectories* to get $\bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, y)$.
  
  - We'll then have
  \[  
  \bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z) = \mathcal{L}(x, z) \union \bd \bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z), \qquad \bd \bar{L}(x, z) = \bigcup_{\mu(y) = \mu(x) - 1} \mathcal{L}(x, y) \cross \mathcal{L}(y, z)
  ,\]
  which "space-ifies" the equation we want.

  - We'll show $\bd \bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)$ is a 1-manifold, which must have an even number of points, and thus
  \[  
  \sum_{\mu(y) = \mu(x)-1} n(x, y)  n(y, z) = 
  \# \qty{\bd \bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)} \equiv 0 \mod 2
  .\]

# Three Important Theorems

## First Theorem: Convergence to Broken Trajectories

- Recall: *broken trajectories* are unions of intermediate trajectories connecting intermediate critical points.

- Shown last time: a sequence of trajectories can converge to a broken trajectory, i.e. there are broken trajectories in the closure of $\mathcal{L}(x, z)$.

- This theorem describes their behavior: 

:::{.theorem title="9.1.7: Convergence to Broken Trajectories"}
Let $\ts{u_n}$ be a sequence in $\mathcal{M}(x, z)$, then there exist
\

- A subsequence $\ts{u_{n_j}}$
\
- Critical points $\ts{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{\ell+1}}$ with $x_0=x$ and $x_{\ell+1} = z$
\
- Sequences $\ts{s_n^1}, \ts{s_n^2}, \cdots, \ts{s_n^\ell}$.
\
- Elements $u^k \in \mathcal{M}(x_k, x_{k+1})$ such that for every $0\leq k \leq \ell$,
\[  
u_{n_j} \cdot s_n^k \converges{n\to\infty}\too u^k
.\]
:::

- Upshots:
  - Every sequence upstairs has a subsequence which (after reparameterizing) converges
  - This descends to actual convergence after quotienting by $\RR$?
  - Yields uniqueness of limits in $\mathcal{L}(x, z)$, thus a separated topology
  - Sequentially compact $\iff$ compact since $\mathcal{L}(x, z)$ is a metric space?

:::{.corollary title="Compactness"}
$\bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)$ is compact.
:::

\newpage

## Second Theorem: Compactness of $\bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)$

:::{.definition title="Regular Pair"}
For an almost complex structure $J$ and a Hamiltonian $H$, the pair $(H, J)$ is **regular** if the Floer map $\mathcal{F}$ is transverse to the zero section in the following vector bundle:
\

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
E_u \da \ts{\text{Vector fields tangent to $M$ along $u$}} \ar[r] & C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; TM)\ar[dd] \\ 
 & \\
 &  C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; M) \ar[uu, bend left, "\mathcal{F}", dotted] \ar[uu, bend right, "\mathbf{0}"', dotted]\\
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

:::


Most of chapter 9 is spent proving this theorem:

:::{.theorem title="9.2.1"}
Let $(H, J)$ be a regular pair with $H$ nondegenerate and $x, z$ be two periodic trajectories of $H$ such that
\[  
\mu(x) = \mu(z) + 2
.\]

Then $\bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)$ is a compact 1-manifold with boundary with
\[  
\bd \bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z) = \bigcup_{y\in \mathcal{I}(x, z)} \mathcal{L}(x ,y) \cross \mathcal{L}(y, z)  \\ 
\text{where}\qquad \mathcal{I}(x, z) = 
\ts{
y \st \mu(x) < \mu(y) < \mu(z)
}
.\]

> Note: possibly a typo in the book? Has $x, y$ on the LHS.
:::

:::{.corollary}
\[\bd^2 = 0.\]
:::

\newpage

## Third Theorem: Gluing


:::{.theorem title="9.2.3: Gluing"}
Let $x,y,z$ be three critical points of $\mathcal{A}_H$ with three consecutive indices
\[  
\mu(x) = \mu(y)+1 = \mu(z) + 2
.\]

and let 
\[  
(u, v) \in \mathcal{M}(x, y) \cross \mathcal{M}(y, z) \quad\leadsto\quad (\hat u, \hat v)\in \mathcal{L}(x, y) \cross \mathcal{L}(y, z)
.\]

Then

1. There exists a $\rho_0 > 0$ and a differentiable map 
  \[  
  \psi: [\rho_0, \infty) &\to \mathcal{M}(x, z) 
  \]
  such that $\hat \psi$, the induced map on the quotient
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
  {[\rho_0, \infty)} \ar[r, "\psi"] \ar[rd, "\hat\psi"', dotted] & \mathcal{M}(x, z)\ar[d, "\pi"] \\
  & \mathcal{L}(x, z) \\
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
    is an embedding that satisfies 
  \[  
  \hat\psi(\rho) \converges{\rho\to\infty}\too (\hat u, \hat v) \in \bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)
  .\]

\newpage 

2. ("Uniqueness") For any sequence $\ts{\ell_n}\subseteq \mathcal{L}(x, z)$,
\[  
\ell_n \converges{n\to\infty}\too (\hat u, \hat v) \quad\implies\quad \ell_n \in \im(\hat \psi) \text{ for } n \gg 0
.\]

:::

- We already know that $\bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)$ is compact and $\mathcal{L}(x, z)$ is a 1-manifold, so we look at neighborhoods of boundary points.

- Why unique: will show that the broken trajectory $(\hat u, \hat v)$ is the endpoint of an embedded interval in $\bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)$.

    - Then show that any other sequence converging to $(\hat u, \hat v)$ must approach via this interval, otherwise could have cuspidal points:

$\qed$
\newpage

# Gluing Theorem 

Broken into three steps:

1. **Pre-gluing**: 
  - Get a function $w_\rho$ which interpolates between $u$ and $v$ in the parameter $\rho$.

    - Not exactly a solution itself, just an "approximation". 

2. **Newton's Method**:
  - Apply the Newton-Picard method to $w_p$ to construct a true solution 
  \[  
  \psi: [-\rho, \infty) &\to \mathcal{M}(x, z) \\
  \rho &\mapsto  \oldexp_{w_p}\qty{\gamma(p)}  \\ \\
  \text{for some } \gamma(p) &\in W^{1, p}(w_p^*\, TW) = T_{w_p} \mathcal{P}(x, z)
  \]
  - [GIF of Newton's Method](https://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/content/4702/plot552.gif)
  

3. **Project and Verify Properties**:

  - Check that the projection $\hat \psi = \pi \circ \psi$ satisfies the conditions from the theorem.

$\qed$
\newpage

# 9.3: Pre-gluing, Construction of $w_\rho$

- Choose (once and for all) a bump function $\beta$ on $B_{\eps}(0)^c \subset \RR \to [0, 1]$ which is 1 on $\abs{x} \geq 1$ and $0$ on $\abs{x} < \eps$
- Split into positive and negative parts $\beta^\pm(s)$:

![Bump away from zero](figures/image_2020-09-19-02-20-24.png)

- Define an interpolation $w_\rho$ from $u$ to $v$ in the following way: let 
  - $\oldexp \left[ \wait \right] \da \oldexp_{y(t)}(\wait)$ and 
  - $\ln(\wait) \da \oldexp\inv_{y(t)}(\wait)$, 

  then
  \[  
  w_\rho: x &\to z \\
  w_\rho(s,t) &\da 
  \begin{cases}
  {\color{blue} u(s+\rho, t)} & s\in (-\infty, -1] \\ \\
  \oldexp\left[ \beta^-(s)\ln({\color{blue} u(s+\rho, t) }) + \beta^+(s)\ln({\color{purple} u(s-\rho, t)} )\right] & s\in [-1, 1] \\ \\
  {\color{purple} u(s-\rho, t)} & s\in [1, \infty)
  \end{cases}
  .\]

- Why does this make sense?
\[  
  \abs{s}\leq 1 \implies u(s\pm \rho, t) \in 
  \ts{\oldexp_{y(t)} Y(t) \st \sup_{t\in S^1} \norm{Y(t)}\leq r_0 } \subseteq \im \oldexp_{y(t)} (\wait)
,\]
  so we can apply $\oldexp_{y(t)}\inv(\wait)$.

- Can make $\abs{s}\leq 1$ for large $\rho$, since 
  \[  
  u(s, t) \converges{s\to\infty}\too \quad &y(t) \\
  v(s, t) \converges{s\to-\infty}\too \quad &y(t)
  .\]

  - So pick a $\rho_0$ such that this holds for $\rho > \rho_0$.

  - Might have to increase $\rho_0$ later in the proof, so $\rho > \rho_0$ just means $\rho \gg 0$.

- Some properties:

  - $w_\rho \in C^\infty(x, z)$ and is differentiable in $\rho$.
  - $s\in [-\eps, \eps] \implies w_\rho(s, t) = y(t)$.
  \[  
  w_\rho(s-\rho, t) &\converges{\rho\to\infty}\too u(s, t)\qtext{in} C^\infty_\loc \\ \\
  w_\rho(s, t) &\converges{\rho\to\infty}\too y(t) \qtext{in} C^\infty_\loc
  .\]

- Now carry out the linearized version on tangent vectors, to which we will apply Newton-Picard:

  - Let $Y\in T_u \mathcal{P}(x, y)$
  - Let $Z\in T_v \mathcal{P}(x, y)$
  - Replace $w_\rho$ with the interpolation
  \[  
  Y\#_\rho Z \in T_{w_\rho} \mathcal{P}(x, y) = W^{1, p}(w_\rho^* TW)
  .\]
  defined by
  \[  
  (Y\#_\rho Z) (s, t) = 
  \begin{cases}
  {\color{blue} Y(s+\rho, t)} & s\in (-\infty, -1] \\ \\
  \oldexp_T\left[ \beta^-(s) \ln_T({\color{blue} Y(s+\rho, t) }) \, + \beta^+(s) \ln_T({\color{purple} Z(s-\rho, t)} )\right] & s\in [-1, 1] \\ \\
  {\color{purple} Z(s-\rho, t)} & s\in [1, \infty)
  \end{cases}
  ,\]
  where the subscript $T$ indicates taking tangents of the exponential maps at appropriate points.

$\qed$
\newpage

# 9.4: Construction of $\psi$.

## Summary

- Newton-Picard method, general idea:

  - Allows finding zeros of $f$ given an approximate zero $x_0$, using the extra information of the 1st derivative $f'$.
  
  - Original method and variant: find the limit of a sequence
  \[  
  x_{n+1} = x_n - {f(x_n) \over f'(x_n)}
  ,\qquad x_{n+1} = x_n - {f(x_n) \over f'({\color{red} x_0} )}
  .\]

  - Second variant more useful: only need derivative at one point:


![Newton Method Variants](figures/image_2020-09-21-07-26-02.png)

\newpage

- Pregluing function $w_\rho \in C^\infty_{\searrow}(x, z)$ from previous section 
  - Exponential decay

- Want to construct true solution $\psi_\rho \in \mathcal{M}(x, z)$, so $\mathcal{F}(\psi_p) = 0$.

  - Suffices to get a weak solution
  - Automatic continuity + elliptic regularity $\implies$ strong solution

- Define $\mathcal{F}_\rho$ as $\mathcal{F} \circ \oldexp_{w_\rho}$ expanded bases $Z_i$ from trivialization of $TW$.

- $L_\rho = (d\mathcal{F}_\rho)_0$ will be the linearization of the Floer operator at zero.

\vspace{5em}

- Adapting Newton-Picard to operators:
  - $L_\rho$ won't be invertible on entire space, but
  \[ {1\over f'(x_0)} \iff L_\rho^{-1}, \]

  - Decompose 
  \[
  T_{w_\rho} \mathcal{P}(x, z) 
  = W^{1, p}(w_\rho^* TW) 
  = W^{1, p}(\RR\cross S^1; \RR^{2n}) 
  = \ker(L_{\rho}) \oplus W_{\rho}\perp,
  \]
  where $L_\rho$ will have a right inverse on $W_\rho\perp$.
    - Where does $W_\rho\perp$ come from?
      Essentially the kernel of some linear functional given by an integral:
  \[  
  W_\rho\perp \da \ts{Y\in W^{1, p} \st \int_{\RR\cross S^1} \inner{Y}{\cdots}\,ds\,dt = 0,\, \text{ plus conditions}}
  .\]

  - Run Newton-Picard in $W_{\rho}\perp$


- Will obtain for every $\rho \geq \rho_0$ an element $\gamma(\rho) \in W_\rho\perp$ with
\[  
\mathcal{F}_\rho(\gamma(\rho)) = 0
.\]

\newpage

  - Where does $\gamma$ come from? 
  Intersection-theoretic interpretation on page 320:
  \[  
  \qty{\oldexp_{w_\rho}}\inv \mathcal{M}(x, z) \intersect W_{\rho}\perp &\subseteq T_{w_\rho}\mathcal{P}(x, z) &\leadsto \gamma
  \\ 
  \mathcal{M}(x, z) \cap \ts{\oldexp_{w_\rho} W_\rho\perp \st \rho\geq \rho_0}&\subseteq \mathcal{P}(x, z) &\leadsto \psi(\rho)
  ,\]
  which we get by exponentiating.

- This gives a codimension 1 subspace in $\mathcal{M}(x, z)$, which we take to be $\psi(\rho)$:

![Intersection interpretation](figures/image_2020-09-21-08-03-43.png)

\newpage

> Schematic picture here for $\gamma, \psi(\rho)$.

\newpage

- Apply the implicit function theorem to show differentiability of $\gamma$ in $\rho$.


- Use a trivialization $Z_i^\rho$ of $TW$ to get a vector field along $w_\rho$ 

  - This is exactly an element of $T_{w_\rho}\mathcal{P}(x, z)$

- Exponentiate to get an element of $\mathcal{M}(x, z)$:

\[  
\psi(\rho) \da \oldexp_{w_\rho}\qty{\gamma(\rho)}
.\]

- **Final Result**: project onto $\mathcal{L}(x, z)$ to get $\hat \psi$.

\vspace{4em} 

**Checking Properties**:

- Existence: show $\hat \psi$ is a proper injective immersion $\implies$ embedding. 
- Uniqueness: show the broken trajectory $(\hat u, \hat v)$ is the endpoint of an embedded interval in $\bar{\mathcal{L}}(x, z)$.

  - Show that any other sequence converging to $(\hat u, \hat v)$ must approach via this interval, otherwise could have cuspidal points:

# Summary/Outline 

## Outline

What we're trying to prove:

- 8.1.5: $(d\mcf)_u$ is a Fredholm operator of index $\mu(x) - \mu(y)$.

What we have so far:

- Define
\begin{align*}
L: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
Y & \longmapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S(s, t) Y
\end{align*}

## Outline

- Took $R^\pm: I \to \Sp(2n; \RR)$: symplectic paths associated to $S^\pm$
- These paths defined $\mu(x), \mu(y)$
- Section 8.7: 
\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
R^\pm \in \mcs \definedas \theset{R(t) \suchthat R(0) = \id, ~ \det(R(1) - \id)\neq 0} \implies L \text{ is Fredholm}
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

- WTS 8.8.1:
\begin{align*}
\ind(L)\stackrel{\text{Thm?}}{=} \mu(R^-(t)) - \mu(R^+(t)) = \mu(x) - \mu(y)
.\end{align*}

## From Yesterday

- Han proved 8.8.2 and 8.8.4.
  - So we know $\ind(L) = \ind(L_1)$
- Today: 8.8.5 and 8.8.3: 
  - Computing $\ind(L_1)$ by computing kernels.

# 8.8.5: $\dim \ker F, F^*$ 

## Recall 
\begin{align*}
L: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
Y & \longmapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S(s, t) Y
\\ \\
L_{1}: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
Y & \longmapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S(s) Y
\\ \\ 
L_{1}^{\star}: W^{1, q}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow L^{q}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
Z & \longmapsto-\frac{\partial Z}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial t}+S(s)^t Z
\end{align*}

\scriptsize
Here ${1\over p} + {1\over q} = 1$ are conjugate exponents.
\normalsize



## Reductions

\begin{align*}
L_1^* &= -\dd{}{s} + J_0 \dd{}{t} + S(s)^t
.\end{align*}

- Since $\coker L_1 \cong \ker L_1^*$, it suffices to compute $\ker L_1^*$

- We have

\begin{align*}
J_0^1 \definedas 
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
\implies
J_0 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
J_0^1           &       &        & \\
                & J_0^1 &        & \\
                &       & \ddots & \\
                &       &        & J_0^1
\end{bmatrix} \in \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \mat(2; \RR) 
.\end{align*}

- This allows us to reduce to the $n=1$ case.

## Setup 

$L_1$ used a path of diagonal matrices constant near $\infty$:
\begin{align*}
S(s) \definedas \left(\begin{array}{cc}
a_{1}(s) & 0 \\
0 & a_{2}(s)
\end{array}\right), \quad \text { with } a_{i}(s)\definedas \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
a_{i}^{-} & \text {if } s \leq-s_{0} \\
a_{i}^{+} & \text {if } s \geq s_{0}
\end{array}\right.
.\end{align*}

## Statement of Later Lemma (8.8.5)

Let $p>2$ and define
\begin{align*}
F: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2}\right) &\longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2}\right) \\
Y &\mapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S(s) Y
.\end{align*}

> Note: $F$ is $L_1$ for $n=1$:
\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
L_{1}: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
Y & \longmapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S(s) Y
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

## Statement of Lemma 

\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
F: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2}\right) &\longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2}\right) \\
Y &\mapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S(s) Y
.\end{align*}

Suppose $a_i^\pm \not \in 2\pi \ZZ$.

1.  Suppose $a_1(s) = a_2(s)$ and set $a^\pm \definedas a_1^\pm = a_2^\pm$.
    Then

\begin{align*}
\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F &=
2 \cdot \#\left\{\ell \in \mathbb{Z} \suchthat 
2\pi \ell \in (a^-, a+) \subset \RR \right \} \\
\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F^{*} &=
2 \cdot \#\left\{\ell \in \mathbb{Z} \suchthat 
2\pi\ell \in (a^+, a^-) \subset\RR
\right\}
.\end{align*}

2.  Suppose $\sup_{s\in \RR} \norm{S(s)} < 1$, then

\begin{align*}
\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F &= 
\#\left\{i \in\{1,2\} \suchthat ~a_{i}^{-}<0 \text { and } a_{i}^{+}>0\right\}\\
\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F^{*} 
&=\#\left\{i \in\{1,2\} \suchthat ~ a_{i}^{+}<0 \text { and } a_{i}^{-}>0\right\}
.\end{align*}

## Statement of Lemma

In words:

1. If $S(s)$ is a scalar matrix, set $a^\pm = a_1^\pm = a_2^\pm$ to the limiting scalars and count the integer multiples of $2\pi$ between $a^-$ and $a^+$.

2. Otherwise, if $S$ is uniformly bounded by 1, count the number of entries the flip from positive to negative as $s$ goes from $-\infty\to \infty$.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{figures/image_2020-05-27-20-10-07.png} 
\end{center}

## Proof of Assertion 1
\scriptsize
1.  Suppose $a_1(s) = a_2(s)$ and set $a^\pm \definedas a_1^\pm = a_2^\pm$.
    Then

\begin{align*}
\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F &=
2 \cdot \#\left\{\ell \in \mathbb{Z} \suchthat 
2\pi \ell \in (a^-, a+) \subset \RR \right \} \\
\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F^{*} &=
2 \cdot \#\left\{\ell \in \mathbb{Z} \suchthat 
2\pi\ell \in (a^+, a^-) \subset\RR
\right\}
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

Step 1: Transform to Cauchy-Riemann Equations

- Write $a(s) \definedas a_1(s) = a_2(s)$.
- Start with equation on $\RR^2$, $$\vector Y(s, t) = \left[ Y_1(s, t), Y_2(s, t) \right].$$
- Replace with equation on $\CC$: $$\vector Y(s, t) = Y_1(s, t) + i Y_2(s, t).$$

## Assertion 1, Step 1: Reduce to CR

- Expand definition of the PDE 
\begin{align*}
F(\vector Y) = 0 \leadsto \bar \del\vector Y + S \vector Y = 0
\\ \\ 
\frac{\partial}{\partial s}
\vector Y
+\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right) \frac{\partial}{\partial t}
\vector Y
+\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a(s) & 0 \\
0 & a(s)
\end{array}\right)
\vector Y
=0
.\end{align*}

- Change of variables: want to reduce to $\bar \del \tilde Y = 0$

- Choose $B \in \GL(1, \CC)$ such that $\bar\del B + SB = 0$

- Set $Y  = B\tilde Y$, which (?) reduces the previous equation to
\begin{align*}
\bar\del \tilde Y = 0
.\end{align*}


## Assertion 1, Step 1: Reduce to CR

Can choose (and then solve)
\begin{align*}
B = \begin{bmatrix}
  b(s) & 0 \\
  0 & b(s)
\end{bmatrix} \qtext{where} \dd{b}{s} = -a(s)b(s) \\ \\
\implies b(s) = \exp{\int_0^s -a(\sigma) ~d\sigma} \definedas \exp{-A(s)}
.\end{align*}

Remarks:

\scriptsize
- For some constants $C_i$, we have

\begin{align*}
A(s) = \begin{cases}
C_1 + a^- s, & s \leq -\sigma_0 \\
C_2 + a^+ s, & s \geq \sigma_0 \\
\end{cases}
.\end{align*}

- The new $\tilde Y$ satisfies CR, is continuous and $L^1_{\text{loc}}$, so elliptic regularity $\implies C^\infty$.
  
- The real/imaginary parts of $\tilde Y$ are $C^\infty$ and harmonic.

## Assertion 1, Step 2: Solve CR

- Identify $s+it \in \RR\cross S^1$ with $u = e^{2\pi z}$
- Apply Laurent's theorem to $\tilde Y(u)$ on $\CC\smz$ to obtain an expansion of $\tilde Y$ in $z$. 

- Deduce that the solutions of the system are given by
  \begin{align*}
\tilde Y (u) =\sum_{\ell \in \mathbf{Z}} c_{\ell} u^\ell  
  \implies \tilde{Y}(s+i t)
  =\sum_{\ell \in \mathbf{Z}} c_{\ell} e^{(s+i t) 2 \pi \ell}
  .\end{align*}
  where $\theset{c_\ell}_{\ell\in\ZZ} \subset \CC$ converges for all $s, t$.


## Assertion 1, Step 2: Solve CR

Use $e^{s+it} = e^s\qty{\cos(t) + i\sin (t)}$ to write in real coordinates:
\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
\tilde{Y}(s, t)=\sum_{\ell \in \mathbb{Z}} e^{2 \pi s \ell}
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(2\pi\ell t) & -\sin(2\pi \ell t) \\
\sin(2\pi\ell t) & \cos(2\pi \ell t)
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha_\ell  \\
\beta_\ell 
\end{bmatrix}
.\end{align*}

Use
\begin{align*}
Y = B\tilde Y = 
\begin{bmatrix}
e^{-A(s)} & 0 \\
0 & e^{-A(s)}
\end{bmatrix} \tilde Y
\end{align*}

to write
\begin{align*}
Y(s, t)=\sum_{\ell \in \mathbb{Z}} e^{2 \pi s \ell}
\begin{bmatrix}
e^{-A(s)} & 0 \\
0 & e^{-A(s)}
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(2\pi\ell t) & -\sin(2\pi \ell t) \\
\sin(2\pi\ell t) & \cos(2\pi \ell t)
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha_\ell  \\
\beta_\ell 
\end{bmatrix}
.\end{align*}

For $s\leq s_0$ this yields for some constants $K, K'$:
\begin{align*}
Y(s, t) = \sum_{\ell\in \ZZ}
e^{2\pi\ell - a^-}
\begin{bmatrix}
e^K \qty{\alpha_\ell \cos(2\pi\ell t) - \beta_\ell \sin(2\pi\ell t) }  \\
e^{K'} \qty{ \alpha_\ell \sin(2\pi\ell t) + \beta_\ell \cos(2\pi \ell t)} 
\end{bmatrix}
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

## Condition on $L^p$ Solutions

For $s\leq s_0$ we had
\begin{align*}
Y(s, t) = \sum_{\ell\in \ZZ}
e^{\qty{2\pi\ell - a^-}s}
\begin{bmatrix}
e^K \qty{\alpha_\ell \cos(2\pi\ell t) - \beta_\ell \sin(2\pi\ell t) }  \\
e^{K'} \qty{ \alpha_\ell \sin(2\pi\ell t) + \beta_\ell \cos(2\pi \ell t)} 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

and similarly for $s\geq s_0$, for some constants $C, C'$ we have:
\begin{align*}
Y(s, t) = \sum_{\ell\in \ZZ}
e^{\qty{2\pi\ell - a^+}s}
\begin{bmatrix}
e^C \qty{\alpha_\ell \cos(2\pi\ell t) - \beta_\ell \sin(2\pi\ell t) }  \\
e^{C'} \qty{ \alpha_\ell \sin(2\pi\ell t) + \beta_\ell \cos(2\pi \ell t)} 
\end{bmatrix}
.\end{align*}

Then
\begin{align*}
Y\in L^p \iff \text{exponential terms} \converges{\ell\to\infty}\to 0
.\end{align*}

## Condition on $L^p$ Solutions: Small Tails

\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
Y(s, t) = \sum_{\ell\in \ZZ}
e^{\qty{2\pi\ell - a^-}s}
\begin{bmatrix}
e^K \qty{\alpha_\ell \cos(2\pi\ell t) - \beta_\ell \sin(2\pi\ell t) }  \\
e^{K'} \qty{ \alpha_\ell \sin(2\pi\ell t) + \beta_\ell \cos(2\pi \ell t)} 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
\normalsize

- $\ell \neq 0$: Need $\alpha_\ell = \beta_\ell = 0$ **or** $2\pi \ell > a^-$
- $\ell = 0$: Need both
  - $\alpha_0 = 0$ or $a^- < 0$ and
  - $\beta_0 = 0$ or $a^- < 0$.

\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
Y(s, t) = \sum_{\ell\in \ZZ}
e^{\qty{2\pi\ell - a^+}s}
\begin{bmatrix}
e^C \qty{\alpha_\ell \cos(2\pi\ell t) - \beta_\ell \sin(2\pi\ell t) }  \\
e^{C'} \qty{ \alpha_\ell \sin(2\pi\ell t) + \beta_\ell \cos(2\pi \ell t)} 
\end{bmatrix}
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

- $\ell \neq 0$: Need $\alpha_\ell = \beta_\ell = 0$ **or** $2\pi \ell < a^+$
- $\ell = 0$: Need both
  - $\alpha_0 = 0$ or $a^+ > 0$ and
  - $\beta_0 = 0$ or $a^+ > 0$.

## Counting Solutions 

\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
\alpha_\ell = \beta_\ell = 0 \text{ or } 2\pi\ell \in (a^-, a^+) & \ell\neq 0 \\
\qty{\alpha_0 = 0 \txor 0 \in (a^-, a^+)} \txand \qty{\beta_0 = 0 \txor 0\in (a^-, a^+)} & \ell = 0
\end{cases}
.\end{align*}

- Finitely many such $\ell$ that satisfy these conditions
- Sufficient conditions for $Y(s, t) \in W^{1, p}$.

Compute dimension of space of solutions:
\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F 
&=2 \cdot \#\theset{\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^{*} \suchthat 
2\pi\ell \in (a^-, a^+) } 
+  2\cdot \indic{0 \in (a^-, a^+)}
\\
&=2 \cdot \#\left\{\ell \in \mathbb{Z} \suchthat 2\pi\ell \in (a^-, a^+) \right\}
.\end{align*}

> Note: not sure what $\ZZ^*$ is: most likely $\ZZ\smz$.
\normalsize

## Counting Solutions

Use this to deduce $\dim \ker F^*$:

- $Y\in \ker F^* \iff Z(s, t) \definedas Y(-s, t)$ is in the kernel of the operator
\begin{align*}
\tilde F: W^{1, q}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2}\right) &\longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2}\right) \\
Z &\mapsto \frac{\partial Z}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial t}+S({\color{red}-s}) Y
.\end{align*}

- Obtain $\ker F^* \cong \ker \tilde F$.

- Formula for $\dim \ker \tilde F$ almost identical to previous formula, just swapping $a^-$ and $a^+$.

$\qed_1$

## Assertion 2

**Assertion 2**:
  Suppose $\sup_{s\in \RR} \norm{S(s)} < 1$, then
  \begin{align*}
  \operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F &= 
  \#\left\{i \in\{1,2\} \suchthat ~a_{i}^{-}<0 < a_{i}^{+}\right\}\\
  \operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F^{*} 
  &=\#\left\{i \in\{1,2\} \suchthat ~ a_{i}^{+}<0 <  a_{i}^{-} \right\}
  .\end{align*}


We use the following:

- Lemma 8.8.7: 
\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
\sup_{s\in \RR} \norm{ S(s) } < 1 \implies \text{the elements in }\ker F,~ \ker F^* \text{ are independent of }t
.\end{align*}

- Proof: in subsection 10.4.a.

\normalsize

## Proof of Assertion 2

\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
F: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2}\right) &\longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2}\right) \\
Y &\mapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S(s) Y
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

- Given as a fact:
\begin{align*}
\vector Y \in \ker F \implies 
\dd{}{s}\vector Y = 
\vector a(s)\vector Y ~~~
~~~\definedas \begin{bmatrix}
-a_1(s) & 0 \\
0 & -a_2(s)
\end{bmatrix}
\vector Y
.\end{align*}

- Therefore we can solve to obtain
\begin{align*}
\vector Y(s) = \vector c_0 \exp{-\vector A(s)}\qtext{where} \vector A(s) = \int_0^s -\vector a(\sigma) ~d\sigma
.\end{align*}

## Proof of Assertion 2

- Explicitly in components:
\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
\begin{dcases}
\dd{Y_1}{s} &= -a_1(s) Y_1 \\
\dd{Y_s}{s} &= -a_2(s) Y_2 \\
\end{dcases}
\quad \implies \quad
Y_i(s) = c_i e^{-A_i(s)}, \quad
A_i(s) &= \int_0^s -a_i(\sigma) ~d\sigma
.\end{align*}

- As before, for some constants $C_{j, i}$,
\begin{align*}
A_i(s) = 
\begin{dcases}
C_{1, i} + a_i^-\cdot s & s \leq -\sigma_0 \\
C_{2, i} + a_i^+\cdot s & s \geq  \sigma_0 \\
\end{dcases}
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

- Thus 
\begin{align*}
Y_i \in W^{1, p} \iff 0 \in (a_i^-, a_i^+)
,\end{align*}

  establishing 

\begin{align*}
\dim \ker F = \#\left\{i \in\{1,2\} \suchthat 0 \in (a_i^-, a_i^+)
\right\}
.\end{align*}

\end{bmatrix}
.\end{align*}


## Case 1: $k^- \equiv k^+ \equiv n \mod 2$

- Take $a_1(s) = a_2(s)$ so $a_1^\pm = a^\pm$
- Apply the proved lemma to obtain

\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
\dim \ker L_1 
&= 2\cdot \# \theset{\ell \in \ZZ \suchthat 2\ell \in (n-1-k^-, n-1-k^+)} \\
&= \begin{dcases}
k^- - k^+ & k^- > k^+ \\
0 & \text{else}
\end{dcases}  \\ \\
\dim \ker L_1^* &= 2\cdot \#\theset{ \ell \in \ZZ \suchthat 2\ell \in (k^- - n + 1, k^+ - n + 1)} \\
&= 
\begin{dcases}
k^+ - k^- & k^+ > k^- \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{dcases} \\ \\
\implies \ind(L_1) &= \qty{k^- - k^+ \over 2} - \qty{k^+ - k^- \over 2} = k^- - k^+
.\end{align*}

## Case 2: $k^+ \not\equiv k^- \equiv n \mod 2$

\begin{align*}

\normalsize




## Case 2: $k^+ \not\equiv k^- \equiv n \mod 2$

- Take $a_1(s) = a_2(s)$ everywhere except the $n-1$st block, where we can assume $\sup_{s\in \RR} \norm{S(s)} < 1$.
- Assertion 2 applies and we get

\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
\dim \ker L_1 
&= 2\cdot \# \theset{\ell \in \ZZ \suchthat 2\ell \in (n-1-k^-, n-2-k^+)} + 1 \\
&=
\begin{dcases}
\qty{k^- - k^+ - 1} + 1 & k^- > k^+ \\
1 & \text{otherwise}
\end{dcases} \\ \\
\dim \ker L_1^*
&=
2\cdot \#\theset{\ell \in \ZZ \suchthat 2\ell \in (k^- - n + 1, k^+ - n + 2)} \\
&=
\begin{dcases}
k^+ - k^- + 1, & k^+ > k^- \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{dcases} \\
\implies \ind(L_1) &= 
\qty{ {k^- - k^+ -1 \over 2} + 1} - \qty{k^+ - k^- + 1 \over 2} =
k^- - k^+
.\end{align*}

> The other 2 cases involve different matrices $S_{k^\pm}$, but proceed similarly.

![](figures/image_2020-05-26-17-28-15.png)

What we're trying to prove:

- 8.1.5: $(d\mcf)_u$ is a Fredholm operator of index $\mu(x) - \mu(y)$.

- Define
\begin{align*}
L: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
Y & \longmapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S(s, t) Y
\end{align*}
where we have uniform convergence in $t$ of
\begin{align*}
S: \RR\cross S^1 &\to \mat(2n; \RR) \\
S(s, t) &\converges{s\to\pm\infty}\to S^\pm(t)
.\end{align*}

- 8.7: Shows $L$ is Fredholm

- By the end of 8.8: replace $L$ by $L_1$ with the same *index* 
  - *(not the same kernel/cokernel)*
- Compute $\ind L_1$: explicitly describe $\ker L_1, \coker L_1$. 

- Replace in two steps:
  - $L \leadsto L_0$, modified outside $B_{\sigma_0}(0)$ in $s$. 
    - Replace $S(s, t)$ by a matrix 
    \begin{align*}
    \tilde S(s, t) = 
    \begin{cases}
    S^-(t)   & s\leq -\sigma_0 \\
    S^+(t)   & s\geq \sigma_0 \\
    \end{cases}
    .\end{align*}
    - Idea: approximate by cylinders at infinity.
    - Use invariance of index under small perturbations.
  - $L_0 \leadsto L_1$ by a homotopy, where $S_\lambda: S \leadsto S(s)$ a diagonal matrix that is a constant matrix *outside* $B_\eps(0)$.
    - Use invariance of index under homotopy.

## Main Results

- Theorem 8.8.1:  
  \begin{align*}
  \ind(L) = \mu\left(R^{-}(t)\right)-\mu\left(R^{+}(t)\right)=\mu(x)-\mu(y)
  .\end{align*}

- Prop 8.8.2: Reducing $L$ to $L_1$ 
  Construct an operator
  \begin{align*}
  L_{1}: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
  Y & \longmapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S(s) Y
  \end{align*}
  where $S: \RR \to\mat(2n; \RR)$ is a path of diagonal matrices depending on $\ind(R^\pm(t))$; then 
  $$\ind(L) = \ind(L_1) = \ind(R^-(t)) - \ind (R^+(t)).$$

- Prop 8.8.3: Reducing $L_1$ to $R^\pm$.
  Let $k^\pm \definedas \ind(R^\pm)$; then $\ind(L_1) = k^- - k^+$.

- Lemma 8.8.4: $\ind(L_0) = \ind(L)$.

- Han's Talk:
  - Prop 8.8.3, using Lemma 8.8.5
- Me
  - Proof of 8.8.5

## 8.8.5: 

Used in the proof of 8.8.3, $\ind(L_1) = k^- - k^+$.

Setup:

We have
\begin{align*}
J_0^1 = 
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
\implies
J_0 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
J_0^1           &       &        & \\
                & J_0^1 &        & \\
                &       & \ddots & \\
                &       &        & J_0^1
\end{bmatrix} \in \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \mat(2; \RR) 
.\end{align*}

We had a path of diagonal matrices of the form:
\begin{align*}
S(s) \definedas \left(\begin{array}{cc}
a_{1}(s) & 0 \\
0 & a_{2}(s)
\end{array}\right), \quad \text { with } a_{i}(s)\definedas_? \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
a_{i}^{-} & \text {if } s \leq-s_{0} \\
a_{i}^{+} & \text {if } s \geq s_{0}
\end{array}\right.
.\end{align*}


Statement: let $p>2$ and define
\begin{align*}
F: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2}\right) &\longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2}\right) \\
Y &\mapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S(s) Y
.\end{align*}

> This looks like $L_1$ for $n=1$?

1.  Suppose $a_1(s) = a_2(s)$ and define $a^\pm \definedas a_1^\pm = a_2^\pm$.
    Then
    \begin{align*}
      \operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F &=
      2 \cdot \#\left\{\ell \in \mathbf{Z} | a^{-} < 2 \pi \ell < a^{+}\right \} \\
      \operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F^{\star} &=
      2 \cdot \#\left\{\ell \in \mathbf{Z} | a^{+}<2 \pi \ell<a^{-}\right\}
    .\end{align*}

2.  Suppose $\sup_{s\in \RR} \norm{S(s)} < 1$, then
    \begin{align*}
    \operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F &= 
    \#\left\{i \in\{1,2\} \suchthat ~a_{i}^{-}<0 \text { and } a_{i}^{+}>0\right\}\\
    \operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F^{\star} 
    &=\#\left\{i \in\{1,2\} \suchthat ~ a_{i}^{+}<0 \text { and } a_{i}^{-}>0\right\}
    .\end{align*}


Remark: Resembles formula for computing index in Morse case, number of eigenvalues that change sign.

Remark: Proof will proceed by explicitly computing kernel.

## Proof

### Assertion 1

**Assertion 1**: 
  Suppose $a_1(s) = a_2(s)$ and define $a^\pm \definedas a_1^\pm = a_2^\pm$.
  Then
  \begin{align*}
    \operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F &=
    2 \cdot \#\left\{\ell \in \mathbf{Z} | a^{-} < 2 \pi \ell < a^{+}\right \} \\
    \operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F^{\star} &=
    2 \cdot \#\left\{\ell \in \mathbf{Z} | a^{+}<2 \pi \ell<a^{-}\right\}
  .\end{align*}


Step 1: Transform to Cauchy-Riemann Equations

- Write $a(s) = a_1(s) = a_2(s)$.
- Start with equation on $\RR^2$, $$Y(s, t) = \qty{ Y_1(s, t), Y_2(s, t) }$$
- Replace with equation on $\CC$: $$Y(s, y) = Y_1(s, t) + i Y_2(s, t)$$.
- Rewrite the PDE $F(Y) = 0$ as $\bar \del Y + S(s) Y = 0$, i.e.
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\left(\begin{array}{l}
Y_{1} \\
Y_{2}
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right) \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\begin{array}{l}
Y_{1} \\
Y_{2}
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a(s) & 0 \\
0 & a(s)
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{l}
Y_{1} \\
Y_{2}
\end{array}\right)=0
.\end{align*}

- Change of variables: let $Y  = B\tilde Y$ where $B \in \GL(1, \CC)$ satisfies $\qty{\bar\del + S}B = 0$ to obtain $\bar \del \tilde Y = 0$.

  - Can choose $B = \begin{bmatrix}
  b(s) ) 0 \\
  0 & b(s)
  \end{bmatrix}$ where $\dd{b}{s} = -a(s)b(s)$.
  - Explicitly, we can take the integral 
    $b(s) = e^{\int_0^s -a(t) ~dt} = e^{-A(s)}$
- Remark: for some constants $C_i$, we have
\begin{align*}
A(s) = \begin{cases}
C_1 + a^- s & s \leq -\sigma_0 \\
C_2 + a^+ s & s \geq \sigma_0 \\
\end{cases}
.\end{align*}

- Remark: the new $\tilde Y$ satisfies CR. 
  It is continuous and $L^1_{\text{loc}}$ and thus by elliptic regularity $C^\infty$.
  Its real/imaginary parts are $C^\infty$ and harmonic.

Step 2: ?

- Identify $s+it \in \RR\cross S^1$ with $u = e^{2\pi z}$
- Apply Laurent's theorem to $\tilde Y(u)$ on $\CC\smz$ to obtain an expansion of $\tilde Y$ in $z$. 

- Deduce that the solutions of the system are given by
  \begin{align*}
  \tilde{Y}(s+i t)=\sum_{\ell \in \mathbf{Z}} c_{\ell} e^{(s+i t) 2 \pi \ell}
  .\end{align*}
  where $c_\ell \in \CC$ and this sequence converges for all $s, t$.
- Write in real coordinates as
  \begin{align*}
  \tilde{Y}(s, t)=\sum_{\ell \in \mathbf{Z}} e^{2 \pi s \ell}\left(\alpha_{\ell}\left(\begin{array}{c}
  \cos 2 \pi \ell t \\
  \sin 2 \pi \ell t
  \end{array}\right)+\beta_{\ell}\left(\begin{array}{c}
  -\sin 2 \pi \ell t \\
  \cos 2 \pi \ell t
  \end{array}\right)\right)
  .\end{align*}


- Return to $Y = B\tilde Y$:
\begin{align*}
Y(s, t)=\sum_{\ell \in \mathbf{Z}} e^{2 \pi s \ell}\left(\alpha_{\ell}\left(\begin{array}{c}
e^{-A(s)} \cos 2 \pi \ell t \\
e^{-A(s)} \sin 2 \pi \ell t
\end{array}\right)+\beta_{\ell}\left(\begin{array}{c}
-e^{-A(s)} \sin 2 \pi \ell t \\
e^{-A(s)} \cos 2 \pi \ell t
\end{array}\right)\right)
.\end{align*}

- For $s \geq s_0$, for some constants $K_i$ we can write
\begin{align*}
Y(s, t)=\sum_{\ell \in \mathbf{Z}}\left(\begin{array}{c}
e^{\left(2 \pi \ell-a^{-}\right) s+K}\left(\alpha_{\ell} \cos 2 \pi \ell t-\beta_{\ell} \sin 2 \pi \ell t\right) \\
e^{\left(2 \pi \ell-a^{-}\right) s+K^{\prime}}\left(\alpha_{\ell} \sin 2 \pi \ell t+\beta_{\ell} \cos 2 \pi \ell t\right)
\end{array}\right)
.\end{align*}
and for $s \geq s_0$
\begin{align*}
Y(s, t)=\sum_{\ell \in \mathbf{Z}}\left(\begin{array}{c}
e^{\left(2 \pi \ell-a^{+}\right) s+C}\left(\alpha_{\ell} \cos 2 \pi \ell t-\beta_{\ell} \sin 2 \pi \ell t\right) \\
e^{\left(2 \pi \ell-a^{+}\right) s+C^{\prime}}\left(\alpha_{\ell} \sin 2 \pi \ell t+\beta_{\ell} \cos 2 \pi \ell t\right)
\end{array}\right)
.\end{align*}

- Then $Y\in L^p \iff$ the exponential terms die at infinity.
  Forces the conditions:

  - $\ell \neq 0 \implies \alpha_\ell = \beta_\ell = 0$ *or* $2\pi \ell < a^+$.
  - $\ell = 0 \implies \qty{a_0 = 0 \text{ or } a^+ > 0}$ *and* $\qty{\beta_0 = 0 \text{ or } a^+ >. 0}$.

This further forces
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
\alpha_\ell = \beta_\ell = 0 \text{ or } a^- < 2\pi \ell < a^+ & \ell\neq 0 \\
\qty{\alpha_0 = 0 \txor a^- < 0 < a^+} \txand \qty{\beta_0 = 0 \txor a^- < 0 < a^+} & \ell = 0
\end{cases}
.\end{align*}

- Finitely many such $\ell$ that satisfy these conditions
- Sufficient conditions for $Y(s, t) \in W^{1, p}$.

\begin{align*}
F: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2}\right) &\longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2}\right) \\
Y &\mapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S(s) Y
.\end{align*}


I.e. $F = \dd{}{s} + J_0 \dd{}{t} + S(s)$.

- Compute dimension of space of solutions:
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F 
&=2 \#\theset{\ell \in \mathbf{Z}^{\star} | a^{-}<2 \pi \ell<a^{+}} 
&=2 \#\left\{\ell \in \mathbf{Z} | a^{-}<2 \pi \ell<a^{+}\right\}
.\end{align*}


Test: 
\begin{align*}
\indic{\theset{ x}}
.\end{align*}

Use this to deduce $\dim \ker F^*$:

- $Y\in \ker F^* \iff Z(s, t) \definedas Y(-s, t)$ is in the kernel of the operator
\begin{align*}
\tilde F: W^{1, q}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2}\right) &\longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2}\right) \\
Z &\mapsto \frac{\partial Z}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial t}+S({\color{red}-s}) Y
.\end{align*}

- Obtain $\ker F^* \cong \ker \tilde F$.

$\qed_1$

### Assertion 2


**Assertion 2**:
  Suppose $\sup_{s\in \RR} \norm{S(s)} < 1$, then
  \begin{align*}
  \operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F &= 
  \#\left\{i \in\{1,2\} \suchthat ~a_{i}^{-}<0 \text { and } a_{i}^{+}>0\right\}\\
  \operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} F^{\star} 
  &=\#\left\{i \in\{1,2\} \suchthat ~ a_{i}^{+}<0 \text { and } a_{i}^{-}>0\right\}
  .\end{align*}


We use the following lemma

- Lemma 8.8.7: 
$$
\sup_{s\in \RR} \norm{ S(s) } < 1 \implies \text{the elements in }\ker F,~ \ker F^* \text{ are independent of }t
.$$

- Proof: see Proposition 10.1.7, in subsection 10.4.a.

- We know (?) 
\begin{align*}
\vector a(s) \definedas
\begin{bmatrix}
a_1(s) \\
a_2(s)
\end{bmatrix}, \quad 
\vector Y \definedas
\begin{bmatrix}
Y_1  \\
Y_2 
\end{bmatrix} \in \ker F \implies 
\dd{\vector Y}{s} = -\vector a(s) \vector Y
.\end{align*}

- Therefore we can solve to obtain
\begin{align*}
\vector Y(s) = \vector c \exp{-\vector A(s)}, \quad \vector A(s) = \int_0^s -\vector a(\sigma) ~d\sigma
.\end{align*}

- Explicitly,
\begin{align*}
\begin{dcases}
\dd{Y_1}{s} &= -a_1(s) Y_1 \\
\dd{Y_s}{s} &= -a_s(s) Y_2 \\
\end{dcases}
\quad \implies \quad
Y_i(s) = c_i e^{-A_i(s)}, \quad
A_i(s) &= \int_0^s -a_i(\sigma) ~d\sigma
.\end{align*}

- As before,
\begin{align*}
A_i(s) = 
\begin{dcases}
C_{1, i} + a_i^-\cdot s & s \leq -\sigma_0 \\
C_{2, i} + a_i^+\cdot s & s \geq  \sigma_0 \\
\end{dcases}
.\end{align*}

- Thus $Y_i \in W^{1, p} \iff 0 \in (a_i^-, a_i^+)$, establishing the formula for $\dim \ker F$.
- Get formula for $\dim \ker F^*$ using $\tilde F$ as before.

$\qed_2$

- Previously: we replaced $S$ with a path of diagonal matrices only depending on $s$.

- Obtained an operator $L_1$.
- Statement: Prop 8.8.3: Reducing $L_1$ to $R^\pm$.
  Let $k^\pm \definedas \ind(R^\pm)$; then $\ind(L_1) = k^- - k^+$.

## Proof

- From section 8.7: $\coker L_1 \cong \ker L_1^*$:

- Recall definition of $L_1$:
\begin{align*}
L_{1}: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
Y & \longmapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S(s) Y
\end{align*}

- We can write the adjoint:
\begin{align*}
L_{1}^{\star}: W^{1, {\color{blue}q}}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow L^{\color{blue}q}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
Z & \longmapsto {\color{blue}-} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial t}+ S^{\color{blue} T}(s) Z
\end{align*}
where ${1\over p} + {1\over q} = 1$ are conjugate exponents.

- Now apply Lemma 8.8.3, which computes the kernels explicity
- Consider four cases, depending on parity of $k^\pm - n$, show all 4 lead to $\ind(L_1) = k^- - k^+$.
    $S_{k^\pm}$ are certain diagonal matrices, and

1. $k^- \equiv k^+ \equiv n \mod 2$.
2. $k^- \equiv n, k^+ \equiv n-1 \mod 2$
3. $k^- \equiv n-1, k^+ \equiv n \mod 2$. 
4. $k^- \equiv k^+ \equiv n-1 \mod 2$

## Review From Last Time


- $u \in C^\infty(\RR \cross S^1; W)$ is a solution to the Floer equation 
- $C(u)$ the critical points and $R(u)$ the regular points of $u$:
\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
C(u) &\definedas \theset{(s_0, t_0) \in \RR\cross S^1 \suchthat \dd{u}{s}(s_0, t_0) = 0 } \\
R(u) &\definedas \theset{(s_0, t_0) \in C(u)^c \suchthat v(s, t) \neq x^\pm(t),~~s\neq s_0 \implies u(s, t_0) \neq u(s_0, t_0)}
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

**WTS**: $C(u)$ is discrete and $R(u)$ is open/dense in $\RR \cross S^1$

- Strategy: "unwrap" $u$ to an easier solution $v$ on $\RR^2$. 

## Strategy

\scriptsize
Strategy:

1. "Unwrapping" $u$. Replace 
    \begin{align*}
\dd{u}{s} + J(t, u) \qty{\dd{u}{t} - X(t, u)} = 0 \qtext{where} u \in C^\infty({\color{blue}\RR\cross S^1}; W)
    \end{align*}
    with a Cauchy-Riemann equation on $\RR^2$:
    $$\dd{v}{s} + J \dd{v}{t} = 0 \qtext{where} v\in C^\infty({\color{blue}\RR^2}; W)$$
    *(Reduces to showing statements for $v$ instead of $u$)*

2. Show $R(v)\subset \RR^2$ is open (short)
3. Show $R(v) \subset \RR^2$ is dense (main obstacle)

Main Ingredients:

- Continuation Principle
- Similarity Principle

# 8.6 Review

## Review: 8.6.1, Unwrapping/Reduction

\scriptsize
If $u$ is a solution to the following equation:
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}+J(t, u)\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-X(t, u)\right)=0
\end{align*}
Then there exist

- An almost complex structure $J_1$
- A diffeomorphism $\varphi$ on $W$ ?
- A map $v \in C^\infty(\RR^2; W)$

where
\begin{align*}
\dd{v}{s} + J_1(v) \dd{v}{t} &= 0 \\
v(s, t+1) &= \varphi(v(s, t)) \\
C(u) = C(v) \quad &\text{and }\quad  R(u) = R(v)
.\end{align*}

- Recall definition of $v$:
  $$v(s, t) \definedas \psi_t\inv \qty{ u(s, t) }$$


\normalsize

## Toward 8.6.3, Injectivity: $R(v)$ is Open

\begin{align*}
C(u) &\definedas \theset{(s_0, t_0) \in \RR\cross S^1 \suchthat \dd{u}{s}(s_0, t_0) = 0 } \\
R(u) &\definedas \theset{(s_0, t_0) \in C(u)^c \suchthat v(s, t) \neq x^\pm(t),~~s\neq s_0 \implies u(s, t_0) \neq u(s_0, t_0)}
.\end{align*}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{figures/image_2020-05-13-23-51-21.png} 
\end{center}


## Sketch of Proof: $R(v)$ is Open

\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
C(u) &\definedas \theset{(s_0, t_0) \in \RR\cross S^1 \suchthat \dd{u}{s}(s_0, t_0) = 0 } \\
R(u) &\definedas \theset{(s_0, t_0) \in C(u)^c \suchthat v(s, t) \neq x^\pm(t),~~s\neq s_0 \implies u(s, t_0) \neq u(s_0, t_0)}
.\end{align*}
Proving $R(v)$ is open: contradict zero derivative.

- Use sequential characterization of being a closed set
- Construct a sequence in $R(v)^c$ converging to a point in $R(v)$.
- First two conditions of $R(v)$ are open, so extract a sequence failing injectivity
- Show it is bounded
- Apply Bolzano-Weierstrass to extract a convergent subsequence
- Use quotient definition of $\dd{v}{s}$, show it is zero, contradiction.
\normalsize

$\qed$

## Toward 8.6.3, Injectivity: $R(v)$ is Dense

Define **multiple points**:

- Set $\bar \RR = \RR \disjoint \theset{\pm \infty}$, extend $v: \RR^2 \to W$ to 
\begin{align*}
v: \bar \RR \cross \RR &\to W \\
v(\pm \infty, t) &= x^\pm(t)
.\end{align*}
- Define the set of *multiple points over $(s_0, {\color{red}t_0})$*:
\scriptsize
$$
M(s_0, {\color{red}t_0}) \definedas \theset{ (s', {\color{red}t_0}) \in \RR^2 \suchthat s\neq s'\in \bar \RR, \quad v(s', {\color{red}t_0}) = v(s_0, {\color{red}t_0}) }
$$

- *Multiple points* are where injectivity fails in $s$.

- Characterizes $R(v) \subset C(v)^c$ as points which don't admit multiples.
\normalsize

# 8.6.3: $R(v)$ is dense in $\RR^2$


## Step 1: Exclude critical points $\intersect$ multiple points

\scriptsize
- Suffices to show $R(v)$ is dense in $C(v)^c$
\begin{align*}
(s, t) \in C(v)^c \implies \exists (s_n ,t)\subset C(v)^c  \converges{n\to\infty}\to (s, t)~ 
\text{ with } v(s_n, t) \neq x^\pm(t)~\forall n
.\end{align*}
- Why? E.g.
$$
v(s + {1\over n}, t) = x^+(t) \implies \dd{v}{s} = 0 \implies (s+{1\over n}, t)\in C(v)
.$$ 
- Then suffices to show every $(s_0, t_0) \in \RR \cross [0, 1]$ with (importantly)
\begin{align}
\dd{v}{s}{(s_0, t_0)} \neq 0 \qtext{and} v(s_0, t_0) \neq x^{\pm}(t_0)
.\end{align} 
is the limit of a sequence of points in $R(v)$.
- Proceed by assuming this is not the case, toward a contradiction.
\normalsize


## Step 1: Exclude critical points $\intersect$ multiple points

\begin{align}
\dd{v}{s}{(s_0, t_0)} \neq 0 \qtext{and} v(s_0, t_0) \neq x^{\pm}(t_0)
.\end{align} 

A Small Ball Avoids Critical Points in the Image

- Surround $(s_0, t_0)$ by a ball $B_\eps(s_0, t_0) \subset R(v)^c$
- We can choose $\eps$ small enough and $M\gg 1$ big enough, defining $$\mathbb{M} = [-M, M] \subset \RR,$$ such that several properties hold:

## Step 1: Exclude critical points $\intersect$ multiple points
\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
\dd{v}{s}{(s_0, t_0)} \neq 0 \qtext{and} v(s_0, t_0) \neq x^{\pm}(t_0)
.\end{align*} 

1. Translate to far enough to get a point outside the image of the ball: 
  \begin{align*}
(s, t) \in \mathbb{M}^c &\cross [t_0-\eps, t_0+\eps]\subset \RR \cross I \implies \\
  v(s, t) \intersect v(B_\eps(s_0, t_0) = \emptyset &\qtext{and} x^\pm(t) \not \in v(B_\eps(s_0, t_0))
  .\end{align*}
  \scriptsize
  - Idea: else, cook up sequences forcing $v(s_0, t_0) = x^\pm(t_0)$, contradicting open conditions 
  \normalsize
2. For $t \in B_\eps(t_0)$, $B_\eps(s_0) \injects W$ is an injective immersion

## Step 1: Exclude critical points $\intersect$ multiple points

\scriptsize 
1. Translated boxes that miss the image of $B_\eps(s_0, t_0)$ *and* contain no multiple points over $(s_0, t_0)$
2. $B_\eps(s_0) \injects W$ immersively

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{figures/image_2020-05-21-16-18-58.png} 
\end{center}

Combine 1 and 2 to show that 

- $v$ is locally constant 
- $(s_0 ,t_0) \in C(v)$
- Every point in $B_\eps(s_0, t_0)$ satisfies open conditions 
\begin{align*}
\dd{v}{s}{(s_0, t_0)} \neq 0 \qtext{and} v(s_0, t_0) \neq x^{\pm}(t_0)
.\end{align*}

\normalsize

## Step 1: Exclude critical points $\intersect$ multiple points

\scriptsize 

3. $$\abs{\mathbb{M}_C}\definedas \abs{\qty{\mathbb{M} \cross I} \intersect C(v)} < \infty$$ 
      since it's the intersection of a compact and a discrete set
  - Perturb $(s_0, t_0)$ so that $$(s, t) \in \mathbb{M}_C \implies v(s_0, t_0) \neq v(s, t).$$
    - Possible since $(s_0, t_0) \not\in C(v) \implies v$ is non-constant in a neighborhood of $(s_0, t_0)$.
  - Decrease $\eps$ so that 
    $$v(B_\eps(s_0, t_0)) \intersect v(\mathbb{M}_C) = \emptyset.$$

## Step 1: Exclude critical points $\intersect$ multiple points

$$v(B_\eps(s_0, t_0)) \intersect v(\mathbb{M}_C) = \emptyset.$$
\scriptsize
This means that in the thick strip containing $(s_0, t_0)$, no critical points land in its image.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 0.7\textwidth]{figures/image_2020-05-21-16-27-40.png} 
\end{center}

Conclude that we *only* have to consider injectivity, not critical points that are also multiple points.


## Step 2: Failure of Injectivity in Small Boxes

\scriptsize 

- Define the set of multiple points over $s_0$:
$$
\mathbb{S}_M(t_0) = \theset{s_1, \cdots, s_N} =\theset{s_i \in [-M, M] \suchthat v(s_i, t_0) = v(s_0, t_0)}
,$$
  
  - Finite, since infinite $\implies$ limit point $\implies \dd{v}{s} = 0.~ \Rightarrow\!\Leftarrow$

- Lemma: For every $\eps >0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that defining
  $$\Delta_0 = [s_0-\delta, s_0 + \delta] \cross [t_0-\delta, t_0 + \delta]$$
  then $$(s, t)\in \Delta_0 \implies \exists s' \in B_\eps(s_j) \text{ s.t. } v(s, t) = v(s', t)$$
  for some $1 \leq j \leq N$.


\normalsize


## Step 2: Failure of Injectivity in Small Boxes

\scriptsize 

- In words: for every $\eps$, we can find a $\delta\dash$box $\Delta_0 \ni (s_0, t_0)$ such that every point in $\Delta_0$ is a multiple point over *some* point in an epsilon ball around *some* point in $\mathbb{S}_M(t_0)$.

- Fix $\eps' <\eps/2$ form Step 1 and apply the lemma to $\eps'$ to produce $\delta$ and $\Delta_0$.
- Apply the lemma: shrink $\Delta_0$ to a closed delta ball $\bar B_\delta(s_0, t_0)$. 
  - **Upshot**: Every point in $\Delta_0$ is a multiple point over some $s_j$.

\begin{center}

\normalsize


## Step 2: Failure of Injectivity in Small Boxes

\scriptsize
$$
\mathbb{S}_M(t_0) = \theset{s_1, \cdots, s_N} =\theset{s_i \in [-M, M] \suchthat v(s_i, t_0) = v(s_0, t_0)}
$$
  

- So partition the ball up: define $\Sigma_j$: all multiple points over $s_j \in \mathbb{S}_M(t_0)$.
- Take smaller $\rho\dash$ball some $(s_\star, t_\star) \in \Sigma_1^\circ$, choose $\eps'$ small enough such that 
  $$
  B_\rho(s_\star, t_\star) \intersect \qty{ [s_1-\eps', s_1 + \eps'] \cross [t_0-\delta, t_0 + \delta] } = \emptyset
  .$$
  
**Upshot**: the shaded region is disjoint from the $\rho\dash$ball.

## Step 3: Final Contradiction
- Construct $v_1, v_2$ which 
  - Satisfy the same Cauchy-Riemann equations
  - Are equal at the origin 
  - Have nonzero derivative at the origin.
- We want to show they are equal on $\RR^2$
- Constructing them: use points from step 2 to translate
  - Obtain $(s_\star, t_\star)$ and $(s_\star', t_\star)$ from previous step.
  - Define
    \begin{align*}
    \begin{array}{ll}
    v_{1}(s, t)=v\left(s+s_{\star}, t+t_{\star}\right) &\implies v_1(z) = v(z + w_1)\\
    v_{2}(s, t)=v\left(s+s_{\star}^{\prime}, t+t_{\star}\right) &\implies v_2(z) = v(z + w_2)
    \end{array}
    \end{align*}
  - Satisfy the same CR equations
  - By construction, they coincide at $(0, 0)$ since $v(s_\star, t_\star) = v(s_\star', t_\star)$.
  - Derivatives at the origin are nonzero, coming from the fact that $\dd{v}{s}(s_\star, t_\star) \neq 0$.

## Step 3: Final Contradiction
- Now work at zero: for every $(s, t) \in B_\rho(0, 0)$ there exists a multiple point $s' \in B_{2\eps'}(0)$ over $s$.

- Use the following extension lemma, consequence of **Continuation Principle**: in this situation, with $X_t \equiv 0$ on $B_\eps(\vector 0)$, then 
  $$z\in B_\eps(\vector 0) \implies v_1(z) = v_2(z).$$

- Define
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{F}: \mathrm{C}^{\infty}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{C}^{\infty}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
w &\longmapsto \qty{\dd{}{s} + J\cdot \dd{}{t}  }w
\end{align*}

- Since $v_1, v_2$ satisfy the same CR equation, $\mcf(v_1) = \mcf(v_2)$ 

## Step 3: Final Contradiction
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{F}: \mathrm{C}^{\infty}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{C}^{\infty}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
w &\longmapsto \qty{\dd{}{s} + J\cdot \dd{}{t}  }w
\end{align*}

Linearize $\mcf$ as we did for the Floer operator to obtain 
\begin{align*}
\qty{d\mcf}_{\cdots}(Y) = \qty{ \dd{}{s} + J_0 \cdot \dd{}{t} + \tilde S } Y
.\end{align*}
where $\tilde S: I \cross \RR^2 \to \endo(\RR^{2n})$


## Step 3: Final Contradiction

- Set $Y = v_1 - v_2$, then
  $$
  S = \int_{[0, 1]} \tilde S  \implies S\qty{ \dd{}{s} + J_0 \cdot \dd{}{t} + S } Y = 0
  $$
- From above, $Y \equiv 0$ in $B_\eps(\vector 0)$, apply **Continuation Principle** to obtain $v_1 = v_2$ on $\RR^2$
- Inductive argument to show 
  $$
  \forall k\in\ZZ,\quad v(s, t) = v(k(s_\star' - s_\star), t) \converges{k\to \infty}\longrightarrow x^\pm(t),
  $$
  which contradicts an open condition. $\qed$


## The Continuation Principle

- Take the perturbed CR equation
\begin{align*}
\qty{\dd{}{s} + J_0 \cdot \dd{}{t} + S }Y &= 0 \qtext{where}
S: \RR^2 \longrightarrow \endo(\RR^{2n}) 
\end{align*}
where $J_0$ is the standard complex structure on $\RR^{2n}$.

- Define an *infinite-order zero* $z$ of an arbitrary function $f$ as 
\begin{align*}
z_0 \in Z_\infty \iff \sup_{B_r(z_0)} {\abs{f(z)} \over r^k} \converges{r\to 0}\to 0 \quad \forall k\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}
,\end{align*}
or for a smooth function,
\begin{align*}
z_0\in Z_\infty \iff f^{(k)}(z_0)= 0 \quad \forall k \in \ZZ^{\geq 0}
.\end{align*}

## The Continuation Principle

- Statement: If $Y$ solves CR on $U \subset \RR^2$ then the set
\begin{align*}
C \definedas \theset{(s, t)\in U \suchthat ~Y \text{ is an infinite-order zero at } (s, t)}
.\end{align*}

- Explanation: for $f$ smooth, $Z_\infty$ is closed. For $f$ holomorphic, it is clopen.
  - From complex analysis: for a connected domain $\Omega$, the only clopen subsets are $\emptyset,\Omega$, so nonempty and $f =g$ on a connected subset implies $f = g$ on $\Omega$.
  - In particular, $Y = 0$ on $U' \subseteq U$ implies $Y = 0$ on $U$.

- Proof is a consequence of the **Similarity Principle**

## Similarity Principle

\scriptsize
- Recall definition of perturbed CR equation: 
\begin{align*}
\qty{\dd{}{s} + J_0 \cdot \dd{}{t} + S }Y &= 0 \qtext{where}
S: \RR^2 \longrightarrow \endo(\RR^{2n}) 
\end{align*}


Let 
  
- $Y \in C^\infty(B_\eps; \CC^n)$, or more generally $W^{1, p}( B_\eps; \CC^n)$, be a solution 
- $S \in C^\infty(\RR^2, \endo(\RR^2) )$ or more generally $L^p(B_\eps; \endo_\RR(\RR^{2n}))$
- $p > 2$

Then there exist
\begin{align*}
\delta &\in (0, \eps), \\
\sigma &\in C^\infty(B_\delta, \CC^n) \\
A &\in W^{1, p}(B_\delta, \GL(\RR^{2n}))
.\end{align*}
such that 
\begin{align*}
\forall(s, t) \in B_{\delta}, ~~\quad Y(s, t)=A(s, t) \cdot \sigma(s+i t) \qtext { and } 
J_0 A(s, t) = A(s, t)J_0
.\end{align*}

\normalsize

## Similarity Principle

Used to prove:

- $C(v)$ is discrete
- "Extension" lemma used to prove $R(v)$ is dense

Some ideas from proof:

- Matrix $A$ will look like the fundamental matrix of solutions to an equation

- Compactify to get $B_\delta \subset S^2$, if $Y: S^2 \to \CC^n$ then we can consider $\bar Y$ as a section of the bundle

\begin{align*}
\left(A^{0,1} T^{\star} S^{2}\right)^{n}=\Lambda^{0,1} T^{\star} S^{2} \otimes \mathbb{C}^{n} 
.\end{align*}

- $\bar Y = 0$ makes $Y$ a holomorphic sphere in $\CC^n$.

## 8.7 Outline

What we're trying to prove

- 8.1.5: $(d\mcf)_u$ is a Fredholm operator of index $\mu(x) - \mu(y)$.

\scriptsize
- Setup
\begin{align*}
S^\pm(t) &= \lim_{s\to \pm \infty} S(s, t), \\
R^\pm_t &\text{a solution to the IVP} \\ 
\dd{}{t}R &= J_0 S^\pm R,\quad R_0^\pm  = \id

  .\end{align*}
  is Fredholm for every $p>1$.
  
  > *(i.e. index makes sense, $\dim \ker L, \dim \coker L < \infty$)*

- Most of the work: $\dim(\ker L) < \infty$ and $\im(L)$ closed.

\normalsize

## 8.7 Outline: Step 1, $\dim \ker L < \infty$

- Main ingredients: 
  - **Elliptic regularity**: For $Y \in L^p(\RR\cross S^1)$ a weak solution of the linearized Floer equation $$LY = 0 \implies Y\in W^{1, p}(\RR\cross S^1)\intersect C^\infty.$$
  - A consequence of the **Calderón-Zygmund (CZ) Inequality**: For $Y\in W^{1, p}(\RR\cross S^1; \RR^{2n})$ and $p>1$,
  \begin{align}
  \norm{Y}_{W^{1, p}(\RR\cross S^1; \RR^{2n})} \leq C \qty{\norm{LY}_{L^p(\RR\cross S^1)} + \norm{Y}_{L^p({\color{blue}\RR} \cross S^1)}}
  \end{align}
  for some constant $C$.
\scriptsize
- Strategy: split into cases
  - Case 1: $S(s, t) = S(t)$ doesn't depend on $s$.
  - Case 2: $S(s, t)$ *does* depend on $s$
\scriptsize

## 8.7 Outline: $\dim \ker L < \infty$

CZ inequality:
\begin{align}
\norm{Y}_{W^{1, p}(\RR\cross S^1; \RR^{2n})} \leq C \qty{\norm{LY}_{L^p(\RR\cross S^1)} + \norm{Y}_{L^p({\color{blue}\RR} \cross S^1)}}
\end{align}

Step 1: $S(s, t) = S(t)$ doesn't depend on $s$, prove improved estimate.

- Consider the "asymptotic operator"
\begin{align*}
D: W^{1, p}(\RR\cross S^1; \RR^{2n}) &\to L^p(\RR\cross S^1) \\
D = \bar \del + S(t) &= \lim_{s\to \pm\infty} L \definedas \lim_{s\to \pm\infty} \qty{\bar \del + S(s, t)}
.\end{align*}
- Show for $p>1, D$ is invertible.
- Invertibility improves estimate: replace $\color{blue}\RR$ with $\color{blue} [-M, M]$.

## 8.7 Outline: $\dim \ker L < \infty$

- Step 2: $S(s, t)$ does depend on $s$
- Improved estimate in Step 1 allows replacing weak soln:
\begin{align*}
Y \in L^p({\color{blue}\RR} \cross S^1; \cdot) &\leadsto Y\in L^p({\color{blue}[-M, M]} \cross S^1, \cdot)
.\end{align*}

- Then restrict
\begin{align*}
L: W^{1, p}(\RR\cross S^1; \RR^{2n}) &\to L^p(\RR\cross S^1; \RR^{2n})\\
L&\definedas \bar\del + S(s, t) & \\ \\
\leadsto L_M : W^{1, p}(\RR\cross S^1) &\to L^p({\color{blue}[-M, M]} \cross S^1) 
.\end{align*}
- Since the restriction is a *compact* operator, it is "semi-Fredholm", apply a theorem:
$$
\text{CZ inequality satisfied} \implies \dim \ker L_M < \infty, \im L_M \text{ closed}
.$$


## 8.7 Outline: $\dim \ker L < \infty$

- Will need some real/functional analysis to invert operators:
  - "Variation of constants"
  - Hilbert spaces and Spectrum of an operator
  - *Hille-Yosida* theory: existence and uniqueness for operator IVPs, e.g. $\dd{Y}{s} = -AY$
  - Young's Inequality (some convolution integrals)
  - Holder's Inequality
  - Distribution theory
  - Rellich's Theorem (Multiple uses)
  - Hahn-Banach Theorem
  - Riesz Representation Theorem
- Conclude 8.7 by showing $L$ is Fredholm:
  - $\dim \ker L < \infty$ (long) 
  - $\dim \coker L < \infty$ (very short)

- 8.8

What we're trying to prove
8.1.5: $(d\mcf)_u$ is a Fredholm operator of index $\mu(x) - \mu(y)$.

# 8.8 

- Define
\begin{align}
L: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbf{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbf{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbf{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbf{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
Y & \longmapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S(s, t) Y
\end{align}

- By the end of 8.8: replace the Fredholm operator $L$ by an operator $L_1$ with the same *index* (not the same kernel/cokernel)
  - Compute the index of $?$ because we can explicitly describe its kernel and cokernel

- Use the fact $S: \RR \cross S^1 \to \mat(2n;\RR)$ and 
  $$
  S(s, t) \converges{s\to\pm\infty}\to S^{\pm}(t)
  $$ 
  which are symmetric.
  - Take corresponding symplectic paths $R^\pm: I \to \Sp(2n; \RR)$.
  - If 
  $$
  R^\pm \in \mcs \definedas \theset{R: I \to \Sp(2n; \RR) \suchthat R(0) = \id, \det(R(1) - \id)\neq 0}
  ,$$ 
  then $L$ is a Fredholm operator

- Theorem 8.8.1: $\ind(L) = \mu(R^-(t)) - \mu(R^+(t)) = \mu(x) - \mu(y)$.

- Prop 8.8.2: Define an operator
\begin{align*}
L_{1}: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbf{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbf{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbf{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbf{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
Y & \longmapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S(s) Y
\end{align*}
where $S: \RR \to\mat(2n; \RR)$ is a path of diagonal matrices depending on $\ind(R^\pm(t))$; then $\ind(L_1) = \ind(L)$.

  - Then $\ind(L_1) = \ind(R^-(t)) - \ind (R^+(t))$.
  - Idea of proof: take a homotopy of operators
    \begin{align*}
    L_{\lambda}: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbf{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbf{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbf{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbf{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
    Y & \longmapsto \frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S_{\lambda}(s, t) Y
    \end{align*}
    which are all Fredholm and all have the same index, then take time 1.
  - Use the fact that $\coker L_1 \cong \ker L_1^*$, and we can explicitly write the adjoint of $L_1$.
  - Get a formula that resembles the Morse case: counting the number of eigenvalues that change sign.

- Summary:
  - Replace $L$ by $L_0$, which is modified in a neighborhood of zero in the $s$ variable. Use invariance of index under small perturbations.
  - Homotope $L_0$ to $L_1$, where $S$ is replaced by a diagonal matrix $S(s)$ that is a constant matrix outside the neighborhood of zero in $s$. Use invariance of index under homotopy.

# 8.7

- Goal: Toward 8.1.5, show that $L \definedas \bar \del + S(s, t): W^{1, p} \to L^p$  is a Fredholm operator, i.e. the index makes sense (finite-dimensional kernel and cokernel).
- Statement: if $\det(\id - R^\pm_1) \neq 0$ then the operator
  \begin{align*}
  L: W^{1, p}(\RR\cross S^1; \RR^{2n}) \to L^p(\RR\cross S^1; \RR^{2n})\\
  .\end{align*}
  given by $L = \bar\del + S(s, t)$ is Fredholm for every $p>1$.
  > Most of the work goes into showing that $\dim(\ker L) < \infty$ and $\im(L)$ is closed.

- $\dim \ker L < \infty$:
  - Use elliptic regularity and consequence of Calderón-Zygmund inequality.
    - Elliptic regularity: If $Y \in L^p$ is a weak solution of the linearized Floer equation $LY = 0$, then $Y\in W^{1, p}$ and is smooth.
    - Consequence: If $Y\in W^{1, p}$ and $p>1$ then $\norm{Y}_{W^{1, p}} = O(\norm{LY}_{L^p} + \norm{Y}_{L^p}  )$.
  - Case 1: $S(s, t) = S(t)$ doesn't depend on $s$.
    - Then $L$ is a bijective for every $p>1$
    - Invertibility allows replacing the weak solution $Y \in L^p(\RR \cross S^1; \cdot)$ with $Y\in L^p([-M, M] \cross S^1, \cdot)$ for $M\gg 0$
    - Restriction $\bar L: W^{1, p}(\RR\cross S^1) \to L^p([-M, M] \cross S^1)$ is a compact operator, it is "semi-Fredholm"
    - Apply a theorem: if the inequality is satisfies, the kernel is finite-dimensional and the image is closed.

- $\dim \coker L < \infty$:
  - Take
  \begin{align*}
  L: W^{1, p}(\RR\cross S^1; \RR^{2n}) \to L^p(\RR\cross S^1; \RR^{2n})\\
  \end{align*}
  and consider the adjoint operator
  \begin{align*}
  L^{\star}: W^{1, q}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) \longrightarrow L^{q}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right)
  \end{align*}
  where $p\inv + q\inv = 1$, which appeared in 8.5.1.
  - Use the fact that $\coker L = \ker L^\star$
  - Show $\dim \ker L^\star < \infty$ since it satisfies the conditions of 8.7.4.

# 8.6

- Start with $u \in C^\infty(\RR \cross S^1; W)$ a solution to the equation 
$$\dd{u}{s} + J_1(t, u) \qty{\dd{u}{t} - X(t, u)} = 0$$

- "Unwrap the cylinder" to a map $v\in C^\infty(\RR^2; W)$ which is a solution to $\qty{\dd{}{s} + J\dd{}{t}}u = 0$
  - No longer periodic; instead $v(s, t+1) = \phi(v(s, t))$.
  - Built by precomposing $u$ with the inverse flow $\psi_t$ of $X_t$
  - Conjugate original $J$ with $\psi$ to get $J_1$

- Define regular points $R(v)$ as $\dd{}{s}v \neq 0$ with injectivity condition: $s \neq s' \implies v(s, t) \neq v(s', t)$.

- Prove "injectivity result": $R(v) \subseteq \RR^2$ is dense and open

## 8.6.3, Part 1: R(v) is Open

- Prove $R(v)$ is open: contradict zero derivative
  - Proof uses sequential characterization of being a closed set
  - Construct a sequence in the complement converging to a regular point
  - Since first two conditions of $R(v)$ are open, extract a sequence of points failing injectivity
  - Show it is bounded
  - Apply Bolzano-Weierstrass to extract a convergent subsequence
  - Use quotient definition of derivative, show it is zero, contradiction.

## 8.6.3, Part 2: R(v) is Dense in R2 (p.258)


## Step 1: Exclude critical points that are also multiple points

- Definition: *Multiple points* are where injectivity fails in $s$.
  - Characterize $R(v)$ as those in $C(v)^c$ that are not multiples.

- Suffices to show $R(v)$ is dense in $C(v)^c$
  -- Every $(s, t) \in C(v)^c \subseteq \RR^2$ is the limit of $(s_n, t) \in C(v)^c$ where $v(s_n, t) \neq x^\pm(t)$.
    - Why? $v(s + {1\over n}, t) = x^+(t) \implies \dd{v}{s} = 0 \implies (s+{1\over n}, t)\in C(v)$. 
  - Then suffices to show every $(s_0, t_0) \in \RR \cross I$ with (importantly)
  \begin{align}
  \dd{v}{s}{(s_0, t_0)} \neq 0 \qtext{and} v(s_0, t_0) \neq x^{\pm}(t_0)
  .\end{align} {#eq:eq1}
  is the limit of a sequence of points in $R(v)$.
  - Proceed by assuming this is not the case, toward a contradiction.

### A Small Ball Avoids Critical Points in the Image
- Surround every point $(s_0, t_0)$ by a ball $B_\eps(s_0, t_0)$ missing $R(v)$
- We can choose $\eps$ small enough and $M\gg 1$ big enough (defining $\mathbf{M} = [-M, M] \subset \RR$) such that
  1. Translate to far enough to get a point outside the image of the ball: 
    \begin{align*}
(s, t) \in \mathbf{M}^c &\cross [t_0-\eps, t_0+\eps]\subset \RR \cross I \implies \\
    v(s, t) \intersect v(B_\eps(s_0, t_0) = \emptyset &\qtext{and} x^\pm(t) \not \in v(B_\eps(s_0, t_0))
    .\end{align*}
    - Idea: If not, can cook up sequences that force $v(s_0, t_0) = x^\pm(t_0)$, a contradiction to @eq:eq1.
  2. For $t \in B_\eps(t_0)$, $B_\eps(s_0) \injects W$ is an injective immersion
  - Combine 1 and 2 to show that 
    - $v$ is locally constant 
    - $(s_0 ,t_0) \in C(v)$
    - Every point in $B_\eps(s_0, t_0)$ satisfies [@eq:eq1]
  3. 
    - Show 
        $$\abs{\mathbf{M}_C}\definedas \abs{\qty{\mathbf{M} \cross I} \intersect C(v)} < \infty$$ 
        since it's the intersection of a compact and a discrete set
    - Perturb $(s_0, t_0)$ so that $(s, t) \in \mathbf{M}_C \implies v(s_0, t_0) \neq v(s, t)$.
      - Possible since $(s_0, t_0) \not\in C(v) \implies v$ is non-constant in a neighborhood of $(s_0, t_0)$.
    - Decrease $\eps$ so that 
      $$v(B_\eps(s_0, t_0)) \intersect v(\mathbf{M}_C) = \emptyset.$$

- This means that in the thick strip containing $(s_0, t_0)$, no critical points land in its image.

- Conclude that we only have to consider injectivity, not critical points that are also multiple points

## Step 2: Failure of Injectivity in Small Boxes

- Define $$\mathbf{S}_M(t_0) = \theset{s_1, \cdots, s_N} =\theset{s_i \in [-M, M] \suchthat v(s_i, t_0) = v(s_0, t_0)},$$
  the set of multiple points over $s_0$.
  - This is finite, since infinite $\implies$ has a limit point $\implies \dd{v}{s} = 0$, contradiction.

- Lemma: For every $\eps >0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that defining
  $$\Delta_0 = [s_0-\delta, s_0 + \delta] \cross [t_0-\delta, t_0 + \delta]$$
  then $$(s, t)\in \Delta \implies \exists s' \in B_\eps(s_j) \text{ s.t. } v(s, t) = v(s', t)$$
  for some $1 \leq j \leq N$.

  - In English: for every epsilon, we can find a delta box $\Delta_0 \ni (s_0, t_0)$ such that every point in $\Delta_0$ is a multiple point over *some* point in an epsilon ball around *some* point in $\mathbf{S}_M(t_0)$.

  - Proof idea: otherwise, construct a sequence $(\sigma_n, t_n) \to (s_0, t_0)$, use properties 1 and 2 from earlier, extract a limit point $\sigma$ *not* in $\mathbf{S}_M(t_0)$ which satisfies $v(\sigma, t_0) = v(s_0, t_0)$, a contradiction (since that set contained exactly the multiple finitely many points).

- Fix $\eps' <\eps/2$ form Step 1 and apply the lemma to $\eps'$ to produce a $\delta$ and a box $\Delta_0$.
- Apply the lemma: shrink the delta box $\Delta_0$ to a closed delta ball $\bar B_\delta(s_0, t_0)$. 
  - Every point in the delta box is a multiple point over some $s_j$.
- So partition the ball up: define $\Sigma_j$ to be all of the multiple points over $s_j \in \mathbf{S}_(t_0)$.
- Take a smaller $\rho\dash$ball around some point $(s_\star, t_\star) \in \Sigma_1^\circ$, making sure to choose $\eps'$ small enough such that 
  $$
  B_\rho(s_\star, t_\star) \intersect \qty{ [s_1-\eps', s_1 + \eps'] \cross [t_0-\delta, t_0 + \delta] } = \emptyset
  .$$
  In other words, the shaded region is disjoint from the $\rho\dash$ball.

- Then every point in the $\rho\dash$ball is a multiple point over some point in the box around $(s_1, t_0)$. Pick on such point $(s_\star', t_\star)$ on the $t_\star$ line.


## Step 3: Final Contradiction
- Construct $v_1, v_2$ which 
  - Satisfy the same Cauchy-Riemann equations
  - Are equal at the origin 
  - Have nonzero derivative at the origin.
- We want to show they are equal on $\RR^2$
- Constructing them: use points from step 2 to translate
  - Obtain $(s_\star, t_\star)$ and $(s_\star', t_\star)$ from previous step.
  - Define
    \begin{align*}
    \begin{array}{ll}
    v_{1}(s, t)=v\left(s+s_{\star}, t+t_{\star}\right) &\implies v_1(z) = v(z + w_1)\\
    v_{2}(s, t)=v\left(s+s_{\star}^{\prime}, t+t_{\star}\right) &\implies v_2(z) = v(z + w_2)
    \end{array}
    \end{align*}
  - Satisfy the same CR equations
  - By construction, they coincide at $(0, 0)$ since $v(s_\star, t_\star) = v(s_\star', t_\star)$.
  - Derivatives at the origin are nonzero, coming from the fact that $\dd{v}{s}(s_\star, t_\star) \neq 0$.

- Now work at zero: for every $(s, t) \in B_\rho(0, 0)$ there exists a multiple point $s' \in B_{2\eps'}(0)$ over $s$.

- Use the following extension lemma, consequence of **Continuation Principle**: in this situation, with $X_t \equiv 0$ on $B_\eps(\vector 0)$, then 
  $$z\in B_\eps(\vector 0) \implies v_1(z) = v_2(z).$$

- Define
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{F}: \mathrm{C}^{\infty}\left(\mathbf{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbf{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{C}^{\infty}\left(\mathbf{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbf{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
w &\longmapsto \qty{\dd{}{s} + J\cdot \dd{}{t}  }w
\end{align*}

- Since $v_1, v_2$ satisfy the same CR equation, $\mcf(v_1) = \mcf(v_2)$ 
- Linearize $\mcf$ as we did for the Floer operator to obtain 
\begin{align*}
\qty{d\mcf}_{\cdots}(Y) = \qty{ \dd{}{s} + J_0 \cdot \dd{}{t} + \tilde S } Y
.\end{align*}
where $\tilde S: I \cross \RR^2 \to \endo(\RR^{2n})$

- Set $Y = v_1 - v_2$, then
  $$
  S = \int_{[0, 1]} \tilde S  \implies S\qty{ \dd{}{s} + J_0 \cdot \dd{}{t} + S } Y = 0
  $$
- From above, $Y \equiv 0$ in $B_\eps(\vector 0)$, apply **Continuation Principle** to obtain $v_1 = v_2$ on $\RR^2$
- Inductive argument to show 
  $$
  \forall k\in\ZZ,\quad v(s, t) = v(k(s_\star' - s_\star), t) \converges{k\to \infty}\longrightarrow x^\pm(t),
  $$
  which is the desired contradiction. $\qed$

BREAK

## The Continuation Principle

- Take the perturbed CR equation
\begin{align*}
\qty{\dd{}{s} + J_0 \cdot \dd{}{t} + S }Y &= 0 \qtext{where}
S: \RR^2 \longrightarrow \endo(\RR^{2n}) 
\end{align*}
where $J_0$ is the standard complex structure on $\RR^{2n}$.

- Define an *infinite-order zero* $z$ of an arbitrary function $f$ as 
\begin{align*}
z_0 \in Z_\infty \iff \sup_{B_r(z_0)} {\abs{f(z)} \over r^k} \converges{r\to 0}\to 0 \quad \forall k\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}
,\end{align*}
or for a smooth function,
\begin{align*}
z_0\in Z_\infty \iff f^{(k)}(z_0)= 0 \quad \forall k \in \ZZ^{\geq 0}
.\end{align*}

- Statement: If $Y$ solves CR on $U \subset \RR^2$ then the set
\begin{align*}
C \definedas \theset{(s, t)\in U \suchthat ~Y \text{ is an infinite-order zero at } (s, t)}
.\end{align*}

- Explanation: for $f$ smooth, $Z_\infty$ is closed. For $f$ holomorphic, it is clopen.
  - From complex analysis: for a connected domain $\Omega$, the only clopen subsets are $\emptyset,\Omega$, so nonempty and $f =g$ on a connected subset implies $f = g$ on $\Omega$.
  - In particular, $Y = 0$ on $U' \subseteq U$ implies $Y = 0$ on $U$.

- Prove is a consequence of the **Similarity Principle**

## Similarity Principle


- Statement:
  - Recall definition of perturbed CR equation: 
  \begin{align*}
  \qty{\dd{}{s} + J_0 \cdot \dd{}{t} + S }Y &= 0 \qtext{where}
  S: \RR^2 \longrightarrow \endo(\RR^{2n}) 
  \end{align*}

  - Let 

  - $Y \in C^\infty(B_\eps; \CC^n)$, or more generally $W^{1, p}( B_\eps; \CC^n)$, be a solution 
  - $S \in C^\infty(\RR^2, \endo(\RR^2) )$ or more generally $L^p(B_\eps; \endo_\RR(\RR^{2n}))$
  - $p > 2$

  Then there exist
  \begin{align*}
  \delta &\in (0, \eps), \\
  \sigma &\in C^\infty(B_\delta, \CC^n) \\
  A &\in W^{1, p}(B_\delta, \GL(\RR^{2n}))
  .\end{align*}
  such that 
  \begin{align*}
  \forall(s, t) \in B_{\delta}, ~~\quad Y(s, t)=A(s, t) \cdot \sigma(s+i t) \qtext { and } 
  J_0 A(s, t) = A(s, t)J_0
  .\end{align*}

- Used to prove:
  - $C(v)$ is discrete
  - "Extension" lemma used to prove $R(v)$ is dense

- Some ideas from proof:
  - Matrix $A$ will look like the fundamental matrix of solutions to the equation
  - Compactify to get $B_\delta \subset S^2$, if $Y: S^2 \to \CC^n$ then we can consider the section

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\left(A^{0,1} T^{\star} S^{2}\right)^{n}=\Lambda^{0,1} T^{\star} S^{2} \otimes \mathbb{C}^{n} \ar[d]\\
X \ar[u, "\bar \del Y"', bend right=50, dotted]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

  - $\bar Y = 0$ makes $Y$ a holomorphic sphere in $\CC^n$.

## Odds and Ends

- Theorem: the following is a surjective Fredholm operator for every $p> 1$:
\begin{align*}
\bar{\partial}: W^{1, p}\left(S^{2}, \mathbb{C}^{n}\right) \longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\Lambda^{0,1} T^{\star} S^{2} \otimes \mathbb{C}^{n}\right)
.\end{align*}

  - Computation will show that $\dim \ker \bar \del = \dim \coker \bar \del = 2n$, so $\ind \bar \del = 0$.

## Outline

Two Goals:

1. Critical points are discrete and regular points are open/dense.
2. The continuation principle (used elsewhere, see diagram later) 
  - Idea: For $\CC$, a holomorphic function with all derivatives vanishing on a line is identically zero.

What we'll try to prove:

- 8.6.1: Reduction to Cauchy-Riemann equations on $\RR^2$ (short)
- 8.6.3 (Partial): $R(v)$ is open.

\newpage 

Statements of "big" theorems for the chapter, in reverse order of implication:

- 8.1.5: $(d\mcf)_u$ is a Fredholm operator of index $\mu(x) - \mu(y)$.
- 8.1.4: $\Gamma: W^{1, p} \cross C_\eps^\infty \to L^p$ has a continuous right-inverse and is surjective
- 8.1.3: $\mcz(x, y, J)$ is a Banach manifold
- 8.1.1: For $h\in \mch_{\text{reg}}, H_0 + h$ is nondegenerate and $(d\mcf)_u$ is surjective for every $u\in \mcm(H_0 + h, J)$.
- 8.1.2: For $h \in \mch_{\text{reg}}$ and all contractible orbits $x, y$ of $H_0$, $\mcm(x, y, H_0 + h)$ is a manifold of dimension $\mu(x) - \mu(y)$.

## Notation

- The Floer equation and its linearization:
\begin{align*}
\mcf(u) &= \dd{u}{s} + J \dd{u}{t} + \grad_u(H) = 0 \\
\qty{d\mcf}_u(Y) &= \dd{Y}{s} + J_0 \dd{Y}{t} + S\cdot Y \\ 
&Y\in u^* TW,~ S \in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; \endo(\RR^{2n}))
.\end{align*}

- $X(t, u): S^1\cross W \to W$ is a time-dependent periodic vector field on $\RR^{2n}$, $J$ an almost-complex structure, both smooth

- $u \in C^\infty(\RR \cross S^1; W)$ is a solution to the equation 
$$\dd{u}{s} + J(t, u) \qty{\dd{u}{t} - X(t, u)} = 0$$

  > Note: not sure why we've replaced $\grad_u(H)$ with $-J(t, u) \cdot X(t, u)$ in the Floer equation.

- $C(u)$ the set of critical points and $R(u)$ the set of regular points of $u$:
\begin{align*}
(s_0, t_0) \in C(u) \subseteq \RR\cross S^1 &\iff \dd{u}{s}(s_0, t_0) = 0 \\
(s_0, t_0) \in R(u) \subset \RR \cross S^1 &\iff (s_0, t_0) \not\in C(u)  ~\& ~s\neq s_0 \implies u(s_0, t_0) \neq u(s, t_0)
.\end{align*}

\newpage 

## Goal 1: Discrete Critical Points and Dense Regular Points

Goal 1: prove the following theorem

Theorem (8.5.4)
:   \hfill

    1. $C(u)$ is discrete and 
    2. $R(u) \injects \RR \cross S^1$ is open and dense.

Outline of the proof:
\normalsize

- Prove 8.6.1: Reduction to CR 
  - (direct, short) which transforms the Floer(?) equation
    $$\dd{u}{s} + J(t, u) \qty{\dd{u}{t} - X(t, u)} = 0 \qtext{where} u \in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; W)$$
    to a Cauchy-Riemann equation on $\RR^2$:
    $$\dd{v}{s} + J \dd{v}{t} = 0 \qtext{where} v\in C^\infty(\RR^2; W)$$
- Reduce 8.5.4 (Discrete/Open/Dense) to two statements
  - 8.6.2: $C(v)$ (and thus $C(u)$) is discrete
    Proved later using 8.6.8: *Similarity Principle*.
  - 8.6.3 (Injectivity): 
    If $v$ is a smooth periodic solution of CR with $\dd{v}{s}\neq 0$ then $R(v) \subseteq \RR^2$ is open and dense.
- Prove 8.6.3 (Injectivity)
  - Show open (easier)
  - Show dense (delicate!)
- Prove 8.6.8: Similarity Principle
  - Use similarity principle to prove 8.6.6: Continuation Principle. Yields theorem.

## 8.6.1: Transform to Cauchy-Riemann

Proposition (8.6.1, Transform to CR-equation on R2)
:   If $u$ is a solution to the following equation:
    \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial s}+J(t, u)\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-X(t, u)\right)=0
    .\end{align*}

    Then there exists

    - An almost complex structure $J_1$
    - A diffeomorphism $\varphi$ on $W$ ?
    - A map $v \in C^\infty(\RR^2; W)$

    satisfying

    $$
      \dd{v}{s} + J_1(v) \dd{v}{t} = 0 
    $$

    where
    
    1. $v(s, t+1) = \varphi(v(s, t))$
    
    2. $C(u) = C(v)$, i.e. $u, v$ have the same critical points
    
    3. $R(u) = R(v)$.



Proof

- Recall the vector field was defined as $X(t, u): S^1\cross W \to W$.

- Since $W\cross S^1$ is compact, the flow $\psi_t$ of $X_t$ is defined on all of $W$
  - We thus have a map $\psi_t: W\to W$ such that
$$\dd{}{t}\psi_t = X_t \circ \psi_t, \quad\quad \psi_0 = \id$$


- Define the (important!) map 
  $$v(s, t) \definedas \qty{\psi_t\inv \circ u}(s, t)$$

\newpage

- Since $W\cross S^1$ is compact, the flow $\psi_t$ of $X_t$ is defined on all of $W$
  - We thus have a map $\psi_t: W\to W$ such that
$$\dd{}{t}\psi_t = X_t \circ \psi_t, \quad\quad \psi_0 = \id$$

- Define the (important!) map 
  $$v(s, t) \definedas \qty{\psi_t\inv \circ u}(s, t)$$

- We can then compute
\begin{align*}
\dd{u}{s} &= \color{blue} \qty{d\psi_t} \qty{\dd{v}{s}}  \\
\dd{u}{t} &= \color{orange} \qty{d\psi_t} \qty{\dd{v}{t}} + X_t(u)
.\end{align*}

  - Attempt at explanation: rearrange, use chain rule, and known derivative of $\psi_t$:
  \begin{align*}
  u(s, t) = \qty{\psi_t \circ v}(s, t) 
&\implies \dd{u}{s}(s, t) = \dd{\psi_t}{s}\qty{v(s, t)} \cdot \dd{v}{s}(s, t) \\ \\
{}_? &\implies \dd{u}{s} = \qty{d \psi_t} \cdot \qty{\dd{v}{s}}
  \end{align*}
  and
  \begin{align*}
\dd{u}{t}(s, t) &= \dd{\psi_t}{t}\qty{v(s, t)} \cdot \dd{v}{t}(s, t) \\
  &= \qty{X_t \circ \psi_t}(v(s, t)) \cdot \dd{v}{t}{(s, t)} \\
  &= \qty{X_t \circ \color{red}\psi_t\circ v}(s, t) \cdot \dd{v}{t}{(s, t)} \\
  &= X_t(u(s, t))  \cdot \dd{v}{t}{(s, t)} \\
  &= X_t(u) \qty{\dd{v}{t}} \cdots ????
  .\end{align*}

> Note sure how to relate partial derivatives $\dd{}{\wait} \psi_t$ to differential $d\psi_t$.
> Not sure why we're picking up *addition* in the $t$ derivative.

\newpage

- Given that result, we can compute,
\begin{align*}
0 
&= \frac{\partial u}{\partial s}+J\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-X_{t}(u)\right) &\text{since $u$ is a solution} \\
&= {\color{blue} \dd{u}{s}} + J {\color{orange} \dd{u}{t}} - J X_t(u) &\text{expanding terms} \\
&= \qty{\color{blue} \qty{d\psi_t} \qty{\dd{v}{s}}  } + J \qty{\color{orange}\qty{d\psi_t} \qty{\dd{v}{t}} + X_t(u) } - J X_t(u) &\text{by substitution} \\
&= \left(d \psi_{t}\right)\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial s}\right)+J(u)\left(d \psi_{t}\right)\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}\right) &\text{cancelling} \\
&= \left(d \psi_{t}\right)\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial s} + 
{\color{red} \left( d \psi_{t}\right)^{-1} J(u)\left(d \psi_{t}\right)\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}\right) }
\right) &\text{collecting terms}\\
&\definedas \left(d \psi_{t}\right)\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial s} + 
{\color{red} \psi_t^* J(v) } 
\right)
&\text{by definition}
.\end{align*}

- Conclude that $v$ is a solution of
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial s}+\psi_{t}^{\star} J(v) \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}=0
.\end{align*}

- Set $\varphi \definedas \psi_1$ and $J_1(v) \definedas \psi_1^* J(v)$ to obtain
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial s}+ J_1(v) \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}=0
\end{align*}
of which $v$ is still a solution

- Property 1, Periodicity: attempt to check directly, using $\psi_{t+1} = \psi_t \circ \psi_1$:
\begin{align*}
v(s, t+1) &\definedas (\psi_t\inv \circ u)\qty{s, t + 1} \\
{}_?&= \qty{ \psi_1 \circ \psi_t\inv \circ u}(s, t) \\
&= \psi_1 \qty{ v(s, t)} \\
&\definedas \varphi(v(s,t))
.\end{align*}

> Just a guess. If the 1-parameter group is commutative then proving $\varphi(v(s, t-1)) = v(s, t)$ might work.

\newpage

- Recall definition of $v$:
  $$v(s, t) \definedas \psi_t\inv \qty{ u(s, t) }$$

- Verifying that $C(v) = C(u)$: not spelled out. Property of flow?
  - Need to check that $$\dd{u}{s}(s_0, t_0) = 0 \implies \dd{v}{s}(s_0, t_0) = 0$$
    where $$\dd{u}{s} = \qty{d\psi_t}\qty{\dd{v}{s}}$$
  - How: ?
- Verifying that $R(v) = R(u)$
  - Need to check that for $(s_0, t_0) \not \in C(u)$ and $s\neq s_0$ we have
    $$u(s_0,t_0) \neq u(s, t_0) \implies v(s_0, t_0) \neq v(s, t_0)$$
  - Follows directly: 
  \begin{align*}
  v(s_0, t_0) \neq v(s, t_0) 
&\iff \psi_t\inv(u(s_0, t_0)) \neq \psi_t\inv(u(s, t_0)) \quad\text{by definition}\\
&\iff \qty{\psi_t \circ \psi_t\inv} (u(s_0, t_0)) \neq \qty{\psi_t \circ \psi_t\inv} (u(s, t_0)) \quad\text{injectivity of }\psi_t \\
&\iff u(s_0, t_0) \neq u(s, t_0)
  .\end{align*}

## Splitting the Main Theorem

- The main theorem is equivalent to two upcoming statements

Proposition (8.6.2: Statement 1, Critical Points are Discrete) 
:   Let $z = s + it$ where $(s, t) \in \RR^1 \cross S^1$ (?). 
    There exists a constant $\delta > 0$ such that 
    \begin{align*}
    0 < \abs{z} < \delta \implies \qty{dv}_z \neq 0
    .\end{align*}

Proof
: Postponed to p.264 because it relies on the 8.6.8 (Similarity Principle).

For the second statement, we set up some notation/definitions.

- $v\in C^\infty(\RR^2; W)$ is a solution satisfying
\begin{align*}
  \dd{v}{s} + J_1(v) \dd{v}{t} &= 0 \\ \\  v(s, t+1) &= \varphi(v(s, t)) \\ \\ C(v)=C(u),&~R(v) = R(u)
.\end{align*}



- The **regular points** are given by
\begin{align*}
R(v) = \theset{(s,t) \in \RR^2 \suchthat \dd{v}{s}(s, t) \neq 0, \quad v(s, t) \neq x^\pm(t),\quad v(s, t) \not\in v(\RR\setminus\theset{s}, t)  }
.\end{align*}

  > Note: last condition should be equivalent to $s\neq s' \implies v(s, t) \neq v(s', t)$.
  > For reference, also equivalent to $v(s, t) = v(s', t) \implies s = s'$.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{figures/image_2020-05-13-23-51-21.png} 
\end{center}

\newpage

- **Multiple points** are defined as follows:
  - Set $\bar \RR = \RR \disjoint \theset{\pm \infty}$
  - Extend $v: \RR^2 \to W$ to 
  \begin{align*}
  v: \bar \RR \cross \RR &\to W \\
  v(\pm \infty, t) &= x^\pm(t)
  .\end{align*}
  - Define the set of *multiple points* as 
  $$
  M(s, t) \definedas \theset{ (s', t) \in \RR^2 \suchthat s\neq s'\in \bar \RR, \quad v(s', t) = v(s, t) }
  $$
  
  > Note that the same $t$ is used throughout.


- Recast definition of $R(v)$ as "points in the complement of $C(v)$ that do not admit multiples".
  - Potentially incorrect formulation:
  \begin{align*}
  R(v) = C(v)^c \intersect_{(s, t) \in \bar \RR \cross \RR} M(s, t)^c
  .\end{align*}

  - Points to remember:
    - Condition 1, Nonzero $s\dash$derivative.
    - Condition 2, 

Proposition (8.6.3: Regular Points Open/Dense, \"Injectivity\")
:   Let $v$ be a smooth solution of the Cauchy-Riemann equation, then
    \begin{align*}
    \begin{rcases}
    v(s, t+1) = \varphi(v(s, t)) \\
    \dd{v}{s} \not\equiv 0
    \end{rcases}
    \implies R(v) \subseteq \RR^2 \quad\text{is open and dense}
    .\end{align*}

Proof (Long)
:   Splits into two parts:
     
    - Show $R(v)$ is open (easy)
    - Show $R(v)$ is dense (delicate)
  

## Regular Points Are Open

Proving the first part: $R(v)$ is open.

- Want to show $R(v)^c$ is closed.

- Toward a contradiction, suppose otherwise: $R(v)^c$ is *open*.
  - Use limit point definition: $R(v)^c$ is closed $\iff$ it contains all of its limit points
  - So $R(v)^c$ does *not* contain one of its limit points
  - Produces a sequence $$R(v)^c \supseteq \theset{(s_n, t_n)}_{n\in \NN} \converges{n\to\infty}\to (s, t) \in R(v)$$

\newpage

## Sequence is Bounded

- The first two conditions defining $R(v)$ are open conditions:
  - The two conditions: 
  \begin{align*}
  \dd{v}{s}(s, t) &\neq 0 &&\text{Condition 1}\\
  v(s, t) &\neq x^\pm(t) &&\text{Condition 2}
  .\end{align*}
  - Thus for $N\gg 1$ we have
  $$n\geq N \implies \dd{v}{s}(s_n, t_n) &\neq 0, \quad\quad v(s_n, t_n) \neq x^\pm(t)$$

> Note: what is an "open condition"?

- But $(s_n, t_n) \not\in R(v)$ for such $n$, so they must fail the last condition: injectivity 
  - Third condition:
  $$
  s \neq s' \implies v(s, t) \neq v(s', t)
  $$
  - Failing this conditions means:
  $$
  \forall n> N,~ \exists s_n' \in \RR \text{ s.t. } s'_n \neq s_n \qtext{and} v(s_n, t_n) = v(s_n', t_n).
  $$
- Produces a sequence $\theset{s_n'}_{n\in \NN}$, want to show it is bounded.
  - Toward a contradiction, suppose not, then there is a subsequence 
  $$\theset{s_{n_k}}_{n_k\in \NN} \converges{n_k \to\infty}\to \pm\infty.$$
  - This implies
  \begin{align*}
  v(s, t) 
&= \lim_{n_k \to \infty} v(s_{n_k}', t_{n_k}') \quad\quad\text{using continuity of } v\\
  &= v(\pm \infty, t) \\
  &\definedas x^\pm (t)
  .\end{align*}
  - Why? By definition, precisely because we extended $v$ by setting $v(\pm \infty, t) = x^{\pm}(t)$.
  - But condition 2 for points in $R(v)$ says $v(s, t) \neq x^\pm(t)$, so this contradicts $(s, t) \in R(v)$.

So the sequence is bounded.

\newpage

## Reaching a Contradiction

- Sequence is bounded, so apply Bolzano-Weierstrass to extract a convergent subsequence converging to some limit:
  \begin{align*}
  \theset{s_{n_j}'} \converges{n_j\to\infty}\to s'
  .\end{align*}
  - Use the fact that injectivity failed:
  \begin{align*}
\forall n,~ s'_n \neq s_n \qtext{and} v(s_n, t_n) &= v(s'_n, t_n) \\
\implies \lim_{n_k\to \infty} v(s_n, t_n) &= \lim_{n_k\to\infty} v(s'_n, t'_n) \\
\iff v(s, t)&= v(s', t) \hspace{6em}\text{using continuity}
  .\end{align*}
  - Use the fact that because $(s, t) \in R(v)$ we must have $$s = s'.$$

- *(Minor technical point)* Now have $\theset{s_{n_j}'}_{n_j \in \NN} \to s'$ and $\theset{s_n}_{n\in \NN} \to s$
  - Since the latter sequence is convergent, every subsequence converges to the same limit, so $\theset{s_{n_j}}_{n_j \in \NN} \to s$.

- Again using failed injectivity, i.e.
  \begin{align*}
    v(s, t) &= v(s', t) \\
    \implies v(s, t) - v(s', t) &= 0
  .\end{align*}
  we have 
  \begin{align*}
    s_{n_j}' \neq s_{n_j} \qtext{and} v(s_{n_j}, t_{n_j}) &= v(s_{n_j}', t_{n_j}) \\
  .\end{align*}

- In the last step, we do have equality in the limit, $s= s'$, and $\forall n_j$,
  \begin{align*}
    v(s_{n_j}, t_{n_j}) - v(s_{n_j}', t_{n_j}) &= 0, \\
    s_{n_j} - s_{n_j}' &\neq 0
  \end{align*}
  thus
  \begin{align*}
    \dd{v}{s}(s, t) = \lim_{n_j\to\infty} {v(s_{n_j}, t) - v(s_{n_j}', t) \over s_{n_j} - s_{n_j}'  } = 0
  .\end{align*}

- But $(s, t) \in R(v)$ and so this contradicts Condition 1.

This proves that $R(v)$ is open.
$\qed$

\newpage

Lemma 8.6.4 (Failure of Injectivity)
:   For every $r> 0$ there exists a $\delta >0$ such that 
    \begin{align*}
    \abs{t-t_0},~\abs{s-s_0} < \delta \implies \exists s' \in B_r(s_j) \text{ s.t. } v(s, t) = v(s', t)
    .\end{align*}

Proof
: Short, include.

Lemma (8.6.5: Unique Solutions in a Small Ball)
:   Let $v_1, v_2$ be two solutions of the CR-equation with $X_t \equiv 0$ on $B_\eps(0)$, $v_1(0, 0) = v_2(0, 0)$.

    \

    Suppose that $\qty{dv_1}_0, \qty{dv_2}_0 \neq 0$.
    Also suppose 
    \begin{align*}
    \forall \eps ~\exists \delta \text{ s.t. }
    \forall (s, t) \in B_{\delta}(0), ~\exists s'\in \RR 
    \begin{cases}
    (s', t) \in B_\eps(0) \\
    v_1(s, t) = v_2(s', t)
    \end{cases}
    .\end{align*}

    Then 
    \begin{align*}
    z\in B_\eps(0) \implies v_1(s, t) = v_2(s, t)
    .\end{align*}

Take perturbed CR equation:
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}+J_{0} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}+S \cdot Y=0
.\end{align*}

Fix $S\in C^\infty(\RR^2; \endo(\RR^{2n}))$



Lemma (Similarity Principle)
:   Let $Y \in C^\infty(B_\eps; \CC^n)$ be a solution to the perturbed CR equation and let $p>2$.
    Then there exists $0 < \delta < \eps$ and a map $A\in W^{1, p}(B_\delta, \gl(\RR^{2n}))$ and a holomorphic map $$\sigma: B_\delta \to \CC^n$$ such that 
    \begin{align*}
    \forall (s, t) \in B_\delta \quad Y(s, t) = A(s, t) ~ \sigma(s+it) \qtext{and} J_0 A(s, t) = A(s, t) J_0
    .\end{align*}

Use continuation principle to finish proofs of many old theorems/lemmas.

Theorem (8.6.11, Essential property of bar del)
:   For every $p>1$, the following operator is surjective and Fredholm:
    \begin{align*}
    \bar\del: W^{1, p}\qty{S^2; \CC^n} \to L^p(\Lambda^{0, 1} T^* S^2 \tensor \CC^n)
    .\end{align*}

Lead up to the proof of 8.1.5 in Section 8.7

# Goal 2: Continuation Principle
Goal 2: prove a continuation principle:

Proposition (8.6.6, Continuation Principle)
:   On an open $U \subset \RR^2$, let $Y$ be a solution to the perturbed CR equation
    \begin{align*}
    \dd{Y}{s} + J_0 \dd{Y}{t} + S\cdot Y = 0
    \end{align*}
    where $J_0$ is the standard complex structure on $\RR^{2n}$ and $S\in C^\infty(\RR^2, \endo(\RR^{2n}))$.
    \
    Say that $f$ has an *infinite-order zero* at $z_0$ iff 
    \begin{align*}
    \forall k\geq 0,\quad \sup_{\abs{z-z_0}\leq t} {\abs{f(z)} \over r^k} \converges{r\to 0}\to 0
    .\end{align*}

    > For $f$ smooth, equivalently $f^{(k)}(z_0) = 0$ for all $k$.

    Then the set
    \begin{align*}
    C \definedas \theset{(s, t) \in U \suchthat Y \text{ has an infinite order zero at } (s, t) }
    \end{align*}
    is clopen.
    In particular, if $U$ is connected and $Y = 0$ on some nonempty $V \subset U$, then $Y\equiv 0$.



Proposition (8.1.4, \"Transversality Property\")
:   \hfill 
    Define
    \begin{align*}
    \mathcal{Z}(x, y, J)\definedas 
    \left\{\left(u, H_{0}+h\right) | h \in \mathcal{C}_{\varepsilon}^{\infty}\left(H_{0}\right) \text { and } u \in \mathcal{M}(x, y, J, H)\right\}
    .\end{align*}
    If $(u, H_0 + h) \in \mathcal{Z}(x, y)$ then the following map admits a continuous right-inverse and is surjective:
    \begin{align*}
    \Gamma: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) \times \mathcal{C}_{\varepsilon}^{\infty}\left(H_{0}\right) & \longrightarrow L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) \\
    (Y, h) & \longmapsto\left(d \mathcal{F}^{H_0 + h}\right)_{u}(Y)+\operatorname{grad}_{u} h
    \end{align*}

    where $\mcf^{H_0 + h}$ is the Floer operator corresponding to $H_+ h$.

# Review

## Recalling Notation

- The Floer equation is given by
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial s}+J(u) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+\operatorname{grad} H_{t}(u)=0
  .\end{align*}
 
- Critical points of the action functional $\mca_H$ are given by orbits, i.e. contractible loops $x, y \in \mcl W$
- In general, $x, y$ are two periodic orbits of $H$ of period 1.
- Solutions are functions $u \in C^\infty(\RR \cross S^1; W) = C^\infty(\RR; \mcl W)$
- $\mcm(x, y)$ is the moduli space of solutions of the Floer equation connecting orbits $x$ and $y$.
-  $W^{1, p}(x, y)$ and $\mcp^{1, p}(x, y)$ were completions of $C^\infty(?)$ with respect to certain norms.

## The "Program" for Chapter 8

- Show that $\mcm(x, y)$ is a manifold of dimension $\mu(x) - \mu(y)$
- Define $\mcm(x, y)$ as the inverse image of a regular value of some map
- Perturb $H$ to apply the Sard-Smale theorem
- Show the tangent maps are Fredholm operators and compute their index.

# Section 8.3: The Space of Perturbations of H

## Goal

**Goal**: Given a fixed Hamiltonian $H\in C^\infty(W\cross S^1; \RR)$, perturb it (without modifying the periodic orbits) so that $\mcm(x, y)$ are manifolds of the expected dimension.

## Goal

\tiny Start by trying to construct a subspace $\mcc_\eps^{\infty}(H) \subset \mcc^\infty(W\cross S^1; \RR)$, the space of perturbations of $H$ depending on a certain sequence $\eps = \theset{\eps_k}$, and show it is a dense subspace.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{figures/image_2020-04-14-23-36-58.png} 
\end{center}

## Define an Absolute Value  

Idea: similar to how you build $L^2(\RR)$, define a norm $\norm{\wait}_\eps$ on $C_\eps^{\infty}(H)$ and take the subspace of finite-norm elements.

- Let $h(\vector x, t) \in C_\eps^\infty(H)$ denote a perturbation of $H$.
- Fix $\eps = \theset{\eps_k \mid k\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}} \subset \RR^{>0}$ a sequence of real numbers, which we will choose carefully later.

- For a fixed $\vector x \in W, t\in \RR$ and $k \in \ZZ^{\geq 0}$, define 
  $$
  \abs{d^k h(\vector x, t)} = \max \theset {d^\alpha h(\vector x, t) \suchthat \abs{\alpha} = k}
  ,$$
  the maximum over all sets of multi-indices $\alpha$ of length $k$.

  > Note: I interpret this as 
  $$
  d^{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \cdots, \alpha_k}h = \frac{\del^k h}{\del x_{\alpha_1} ~\del x_{\alpha_2} \cdots \del x_{\alpha_k}}
  ,$$
  the partial derivatives wrt the corresponding variables.

## Define a Norm

- Define a norm on $C^\infty(W\cross S^1; \RR)$:

  \begin{align*}
  \|h\|_{\vector \eps}
  &= \sum_{k \geq 0} \eps_{k} \sup _{(x, t) \in W \times S^{1}}\left|d^{k} h(x, t)\right|
  .\end{align*}

- Since $W\cross S^1$ is assumed compact (?), fix a finite covering $\theset{B_i}$ of $W\cross S^1$ such that 
  $$
  \union_i B_i^\circ = W \cross S^1
  .$$

  - Choose them in such a way we obtain charts 
    \begin{align*}
    \Psi_i: B_i &\to \bar{B(0, 1)} \subset \RR^{2n + 1} ~(?)
    .\end{align*}
  
- Obtain the computable form
  \begin{align*}
  \norm{h}_{\vector \eps} &= \sum_{k \geq 0} \eps_{k} \sup _{(x, t) \in W \times S^{1}} \sup_{i, z\in B(0, 1)} \abs{ d^k (h\circ \Psi_i\inv)(z)}
  .\end{align*}

## Define a Banach Space

- Define 
    $$
    C_\eps^\infty = \theset{h\in C^\infty(W\cross S^1; \RR) \suchthat \norm{h}_\eps < \infty} \subset C^{\infty}(W\cross S^1; \RR)
    ,$$ 
   which is a Banach space (normed and complete). 

- Show that the sequence $\theset{\eps_k}$ can be chosen so that $C_\eps^\infty$ is a *dense* subspace for the $C^\infty$ topology, and in particular for the $C^1$ topology.


Theorem
: Such a sequence $\theset {\eps_k}$ can be chosen.

Lemma
: $C^\infty(W \cross S^1; \RR)$ with the $C^1$ topology is separable as a topological space (contains a countable dense subset).

## Sketch Proof of Theorem 


- By the lemma, produce a sequence $\theset{f_n} \subset C^\infty(W\cross S^1; \RR)$ dense for the $C^1$ topology.

- Using the norm on $C^n(W\cross S^1; \RR)$ for the $f_n$, define

  \begin{align*}
  \frac 1 {\eps_n} = 2^n \displaystyle\max \theset {\norm{f_k} \suchthat k\leq n}
  \implies \eps_n \sup \abs{d^n f_k(x, t)} \leq 2^{-n}
  \end{align*}

  which is summable.

$\qed$

> Why does this imply density? I don't know.

## Modified Theorem

The next proposition establishes a version of this theorem with compact support:

Theorem
: For any $(\vector x, t) \subset U \in W \cross S^1)$ there exists a $V\subset U$ such that every $h\in C^{\infty}(W\cross S^1; \RR)$ can be approximated in the $C^1$ topology by functions in $C_\eps^\infty$ supported in $U$.

Then fix a time-dependent Hamiltonian $H_0$ with nondegenerate periodic orbits and consider 
$$
\theset{ h\in C_\eps^\infty(H_0) \suchthat h(x, t) = 0 \text{ in some $U\supseteq$ the 1-periodic orbits of $H_0$}}
$$
Then $\supp(h)$ is "far" from $\per(H_0)$, so 
$$
\norm{h}_\eps \ll 1 \implies \per(H_0 + h) = \per(H_0)
$$ 
and are both nondegenerate.

# Section 8.4: Linearizing the Floer Equation: The Differential of F

## Goal

Choose $m> n = \dim (W)$ and embed $TW \injects \RR^m$ to identify tangent vectors (such as $Z_i$, tangents to $W$ along $u$ or in a neighborhood $B$ of $u$) with actual vectors in $\RR^m$.

> Why? Bypasses differentiating vector fields and the Levi-Cevita connection.

We can then identify 
$$
\im \mcf = C^\infty (\RR \cross S^1; \RR^m) \qtext{or} L^p(\RR\cross S^1; W)
,$$ 
and we seek to compute its differential $d \mcf$.

> We've just replaced the codomain here.


## Definitions 

Recall that 

- $x, y$ are contractible loops in $W$ that are nondegenerate critical points of the action functional $\mca_H$, 
- $u \in \mcm(x, y) \subset C_\loc^\infty$ denotes a fixed solution to the Floer equation, 
- $C_{\searrow}(x ,y) \subset \theset{u \in C^\infty(R\cross S^1; W)}$ is the set of smooth solutions $u: \RR\cross S^1 \to W$ satisfying some conditions:

\begin{align*}
&\lim_{s\to -\infty}u(s, t) = x(t),~ \lim_{s\to\infty}u(s, t) = y(t) \\ \\
&\text{and } \abs{\dd{u}{t}(s, t)}, ~~ \abs{\dd{u}{t}(s, t) - X_H(u)}  \sim \exp(\abs{s})
\end{align*}

## Compactify to Sphere

Fix a solution
$$
u\in \mcm(x, y) \subset C_{\loc}^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; W)
.$$

We lift each solution to a map 
$$
\tilde u: S^2 \to W
$$ 
in the following way:

The loops $x, y$ are contractible, so they bound discs.
So we extend by pushing these discs out slightly:


## Lift to 2-Sphere

$$
u \in C^\infty(S^1\cross \RR; W) \quad\mapsto\quad \tilde u \in C^\infty(S^2; W) 
$$

## Trivialize the Pullback

From earlier in the book, we have

**Assumption (6.22)**:

For every $w\in C^\infty(S^2, W)$ there exists a symplectic trivialization of the fiber bundle $w^* TW$, i.e. $\inner{c_1(TW)}{\pi_2(W)} = 0$ where $c_1$ denotes the first Chern class of the bundle $TW$.

> \tiny Note: I don't know what this pairing is. The top Chern class is the Euler class (obstructs nowhere zero sections) and are defined inductively: 
$$
c_1(TW) = e(\Lambda^n(TW)) \in H^2(W; \ZZ)
$$
> Assumption is satisfied when all maps $S^2 \to W$ lift to $B^3$ $\iff \pi_2(W) = 0$.


We have a pullback that is a symplectic fiber bundle:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
\tilde u^* TW \ar[r, "d\tilde u"] \ar[d]
\arrow[dr, phantom, "\scalebox{1.5}{\color{black}$\lrcorner$}" , very near start, color=black]
\& TW\ar[d] \\
S^2 \ar[r, "\tilde u"] \& W
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

## Choose a Frame

- Using the assumption, trivialize the pullback $\tilde u ^* TW$ to obtain an orthonormal unitary frame $$\theset{Z_i}_{i=1}^{2n} \subset T_{u(s, t)} W$$ where
  - The frame depends smoothly on $(s, t) \in S^2$, 
  - $\lim_{s\to \infty} Z_i$ exists for each $i$.
  - $$\dd{}{s}, \quad \frac{\del^2}{\del s^2}, \quad \frac{\del^2}{\del s~\del t} \quad \actson Z_i \converges{s\to \pm\infty}\to 0\quad \text{for each } i$$


Claim: such trivializations exist, "using cylinders near the spherical caps in the figure".

## Define "Banach Manifold Charts"

Recall we had $W^{1, p}(x, y)$ a completion of $C^\infty$ 
\begin{align*}
\mcm(x, y) \subset C_{\searrow}^\infty(x, y) \subset \mcp^{1, p}(x , y) \underset{\text{defn}}\subset \theset{ (s, t) \mapsvia{\varphi} \exp_{w(s, t)} Y(s, t)}
.\end{align*}  

where we restrict to
 
  - $Y \in W^{1, p}(w^* TW)$, 
  - $w\in C_{\searrow}^\infty(x, y)$

Use the chosen frame $\theset{Z_i}$ to define a chart centered at $u$ of $\mcp^{1, p}(x, y)$ given by
\begin{align*}
\iota: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow \mathcal{P}^{1, p}(x, y) \\
\vector{y} = \left(y_{1}, \dots, y_{2 n}\right) & \longmapsto \exp _{u}\left(\sum y_{i} Z_{i}\right)
.\end{align*}

  - Note that the derivative at zero is $\sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i Z_i$.

## Define the Floer Map in Charts

Define and compute the differential of the composite map $\tilde\mcf$ defined as follows:
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
  \mathcal{P}^{1, p}(x, y) \ar[r, "\mathcal{F}"] \ar[rr, dotted, "\tilde \mcf", bend left]
  \& L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; T W\right) \ar[r]
  \& L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{m}\right) \\
  u \ar[rr, "\tilde \mcf"] \& \&\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}+J(u)\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-X_{t}(u)\right)
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}

  - From now on, let $\mcf$ denote $\tilde \mcf$.

## Add a Tangent

- Take the vector $$Y(s, t) \definedas (y_1(s, t), \cdots) \in \RR^{2n} \subset \RR^m$$
  
    - View $Y$ as a vector in $\RR^m$ tangent to $W$, given by $Y = \sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i Z_i$.

- Plug $u + Y$ into the equation for $\mcf$, directly yielding

## Add a Tangent

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&, matrix scale=0.002]
\mcf(u) =
\& \frac{\partial u}{\partial s} 
\& + J(u) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} 
\& - J(u)X_{t}(u) \\
\mathcal{F}(u+Y) =
\& \frac{\partial(u+Y)}{\partial s}
\&+ J(u+Y) \frac{\partial(u+Y)}{\partial t}
\&- J(u+Y) X_{t}(u+Y)
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

## Extract Linear Part

Extract the part that is linear in $Y$ and collect terms:
\begin{align*}
&(d \mathcal{F})_{u}(Y)  \\
& = {\color{red}\frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}} +(d J)_{u}(Y) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + {\color{red} J(u) \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}} -(d J)_{u}(Y) X_{t}-J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}(Y) \\ 
& = 
\qty{ {\color{red}\frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}} + {\color{red} J(u) \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}}}  \\
& \quad + \qty{ (d J)_{u}(Y) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - (d J)_{u}(Y) X_{t}-J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}(Y)} \\
.\end{align*}


- This is a sum of two differential operators:
  - One of order 1, one of order 0 (Perspective 1)
  - The Cauchy-Riemann operator, and one of order zero (Perspective 2, not immediate from this form)

## Leibniz Rule

- Now compute in charts. Need a lemma:

Lemma (Leibniz Rule)
:   For any source space $X$ and any maps
    \begin{align*}
    J: X &\to \endo(\RR^m) \\
    Y, v: X &\to \RR^m
    \end{align*}
    
    we have
    \begin{align*}
    (dJ)(Y) \cdot v = d(Jv)(Y) - J dv(Y)
    .\end{align*}

## Sketch: Proof of Leibniz Rule

Differentiate the map 
\begin{align*}
J\cdot v: X &\to \RR^m \\
x &\mapsto J(x)\cdot v(x)
\end{align*}

to obtain
\begin{align*}
&J(x + Y) v(x + y)  \\ 
&= \qty{J(x) + (dJ)_{x} (Y) } ~\cdot~ \qty{v(x) + (dv)_x(Y)} + \cdots \\
&= J(x) \cdot v(x) + {\color{blue} J(x) \cdot (dv)_x(Y) + (dJ)_x(Y) \cdot v(x)}  \\
&\quad + (dJ)_x(Y)\cdot (dv)_x(Y) + \cdots \\ \\ 
&\implies d(J\cdot v)_x(Y) =  (dJ)_x(Y) \cdot v(x) + J(x) \cdot (dv)_x(Y) 
.\end{align*}

$\qed$

## Decompose by Order 

Using the chart $\iota$ defined by $\theset{Z_i}$ to write $Y = \sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i Z_i$ and thus
\begin{align*}
(d\mcf)_u(Y) = O_0 + O_1 
\end{align*}
where $O_0$ are order 0 terms ("they do not differentiate the $y_i$") and the $O_1$ are order 1 terms:
\begin{align*}
O_1 &= \sum_{i=1}^{2n} \qty{ \dd{y_i}{s} Z_i + \dd{y_i}{t} J(u) Z_i}  \\ \\
O_0 &= \sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i \Bigg( \dd{Z_i}{s} + J(u) \dd{Z_i}{t} + (dJ)_u (Z_i) \dd{u}{t}  \\
&\quad\quad\quad\quad - J(u) (dX_t)_u Z_i - (dJ)_u (Z_i) X_t \Bigg)
.\end{align*}

## Order One

- Study $O_1$ first, which (claim) reduces to 
  \begin{align*}
  O_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{2n} \qty{\dd{y_i}{s} + J_0 \dd{y_i}{t}  }Z_i = \bar \del(y_1, \cdots, y_{2n})
  .\end{align*}
  where $J_0$ is the standard complex structure on $\RR^{2n} = \CC^n$

- The second equality follows from the assumption that the $Z_i$ are symplectic and orthonormal.

- Note that this writes $(d\mcf)_u(Y) = O_0 + O_{CR}$, a sum of an order zero and a Cauchy-Riemann operator.

## Recap

Note that since we've computed in charts, we have actually computed the differential of $\mcf_u$ in the following diagram

![](figures/image_2020-04-16-01-11-02.png)\

So we've technically computed $(dF_\mu)_0$.


## Order 0 Term is Linear

\begin{align*}
(d\mcf)_u &= 
\qty{ {\color{red}\frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}} + {\color{red} J(u) \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}}}  \\
&\quad +  \qty{ (d J)_{u}(Y) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - (d J)_{u}(Y) X_{t}-J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}(Y)}  \\ \\
&\definedas {\color{red} \bar \del Y} + SY
\end{align*}
where $S\in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; \endo(\RR^n))$ is a linear operator of order 0.

## Order 0 Symmetry in the Limit

Theorem (8.4.4, CR + Symmetric in the Limit)
:   If $u$ solves Floer's equation, then 
    $$
    (d\mcf)_u = \bar\del + S( s, t)
    $$ 
    where 

    - $S$ is linear 
    - $S$ tends to a symmetric operator as $s\to \pm \infty$, and 
    - $$\dd{S}{s}(s, t)  \converges{s\to\pm\infty}\to 0 \qtext{uniformly in $t$}$$


## Proof

Omitted -- $S$ is exactly $O_0$ from before:
\begin{align*}
O_0 
&= \sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i \Bigg( \dd{Z_i}{s} + J(u) \dd{Z_i}{t} + {\color{blue} (dJ)_u (Z_i) \dd{u}{t}}  \\
&\quad\quad\quad\quad - J(u) (dX_t)_u Z_i - {\color{blue} (dJ)_u (Z_i) X_t} \Bigg) \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i \Bigg() \dd{Z_i}{s} + { \color{blue} (dJ)_u (Z_i) \qty{ \dd{u}{t} - (Z_i) X_t} } \\
&\quad\quad\quad\quad + J(u) \dd{Z_i}{t}  - J(u) (dX_t)_u Z_i \Bigg)
.\end{align*}

- The term in blue vanishes as $s\to \pm \infty$ 
  - Using the fact that $u$ is a solution 
  - Uses $\dd{u}{s} \to 0$ uniformly (as do its derivatives?)
- Suffices to show the remaining part is symmetric in the limit

## Proof

- Write the remaining part as 
  \begin{align*}
  A(y_1, \cdots, y_{2n}) = \cdots \implies A_{ij} = A_{ji}
  \end{align*}
  using inner product calculations

- Uses the fact the $Z_i$ needed to be chosen to be unitary and symplectic.

$\qed$

## asdas

Write $O_0$ as a map $Y \mapsto S\cdot Y$, so $S\in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; \endo(\RR^{2n}))$ and define the symmetric operators
$$
S^{\pm} \definedas  \lim_{s\to \pm\infty} S(s, \wait) \qtext{respectively}
$$

Theorem
:   The equation 
    $$
    \del_t Y = J_0 S^{\pm} Y
    $$ 
    linearizes Hamilton's equation 
    \begin{align*}
    \dd{z}{t} = X_t(z)\qtext{at} 
    \begin{cases}
    x = \lim_{s\to -\infty} u & \text{for } S^- \\
    y = \lim_{s\to \infty} u & \text{for } S^+
    \end{cases}\quad\text{respectively}
    .\end{align*}

## Image

Reminder the $x, y$ were the top/bottom pieces of the original cylinder/sphere:


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height= 0.8\textheight]{figures/image_2020-04-15-21-53-36.png} 
\end{center}


## Proof Sketch

- Use the fact that $\dd{Y}{t} = (dX_t)_x Y$
- Expand $\sum \dd{y_i}{t} Z_i$ in the $Z_i$ basis (roughly) to write $\dd{y_i}{t} = \sum b_{ij} y_j$ for some coefficients $b_{ij}$.
- Collect terms into a matrix/operator $B^\mp$ for $x,y$ respectively to write $$\dd{Y}{t} = B^- \cdot Y$$
- Write $(d\mcf)_u = \bar \del + S$ where $S$ is zero order and symmetric in the limit


## Proof Sketch

- Get the corresponding operator $A$ in coordinates
- Expand in a basis (roughly) as $A(\sum y_i Z_i) = \sum s_{ij} y_j Z_i$
- Check that $s_{ij} = \pm b_{i\pm n, j}$
- This implies $$S^- = - J_0 B^- \quad S^+ = -J_0 B^+ \implies \dd{Y}{t} = J_0 S^\pm Y$$

## Final Remarks

- Given a solution $u$, we have a right $\RR\dash$action, so for $s\in \RR$, 
\begin{align*}
u \cdot s \in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; W) \\ 
(\sigma, t) \mapsto u(\sigma + s, t)
\end{align*}
is also a solution, so $\mcf(u \cdot s) = 0$ for all $s$.

> In other words: we can flow solutions?

## Final Remarks

**Punchline**:**$\dd{u}{s}$ is a solution of the linearized equation**, since

\begin{align*}
0 = \dd{}{s} \mcf (u\cdot s) = (d\mcf)_u \qty{\dd{u}{s}}
.\end{align*}

- Along any nonconstant solution connecting $x$ and $y$, $\dim \ker (d\mcf)_u \geq 1$.

From the text:

- $(W, \omega \in \Omega_2(W))$ is a (compact?) symplectic manifold

- $C^\infty(A, B)$ is the space of smooth maps with the $C^\infty$ topology (idea: uniform convergence of a function and all derivatives on compact subsets)
- $C^\infty_\loc(A, B)$ is the space with the $C^\infty$ uniform convergence topology on compact subsets of $A$

- $H \in C^\infty(W; \RR)$ a Hamiltonian with $X_H$ its vector field.

- $H \in C^\infty(W\cross \RR; \RR)$ given by $H_t \in C^\infty(W; \RR)$ is a time-dependent Hamiltonian.

- The action functional is given by
  \begin{align*}
  \mca_H: \mcl W &\to \RR\\
  x &\mapsto -\int_{\DD} u^* \omega + \int_0^1 H_t(x(t)) ~dt
  \end{align*}
  where $\mcl W$ is the contractible loop space of $W$,
  $u: \DD \to W$ is an extension of $x: S^1\to W$ to the disc with $u(\exp(2\pi i t)) = x(t)$.
  - Example: $W = \RR^{2n} \implies A_H(x) = \int_0^1 \qty{H_t ~dt - p~dq}$. 

- Critical points of the action functional $\mca_H$ are given by orbits, i.e. contractible loops $x, y \in \mcl W$
- In general, $x, y$ are two periodic orbits of $H$ of period 1.

- The Floer equation is given by
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial s}+J(u) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+\operatorname{grad} H_{t}(u)=0
  .\end{align*}
  This is a first-order perturbation of the Cauchy-Riemann equations, for which solutions would be $J\dash$holomorphic curves.

- Solutions are functions $u \in C^\infty(\RR \cross S^1; W) = C^\infty(\RR; \mcl W)$
  - They correspond to "embedded cylinders" with sides $u$ and contractible caps $x, y$ regarded as loops in $W$.
  - They also correspond to paths in $\mcl W$ from $x\to y$ (precisely: trajectories of the vector field $-\grad \mca_H$)

    ![](figures/u.png)\
    
    ![](figures/image_2020-04-13-15-49-17.png)\

    Here $u(s) \in \mcl W$ is a loop with value at time $t$ given by $u(s, t)$, and $\lim_{s\to - \infty} u_s(t) = x, \lim_{s\to \infty} u_s(t) = y$.

- The energy of a solution is $E(u) = \int_{\RR\cross S^1} \abs{\del_s u}^2 ~ds dt$.
- $\mcm = \theset{u \in C^\infty(\RR; \mcl W) \suchthat E(u) < \infty}$ (contractible solutions of finite energy), which is compact.

- $\mcm(x, y)$ is the space of solutions of the Floer equation connecting orbits $x$ and $y$.

- $C_{\searrow}(x, y)$:
  \begin{align*}
  C_{\searrow}(x, y) \definedas \{
  u \in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; W) \suchthat 
  &\lim_{s\to -\infty}u(s, t) = x(t),\quad 
  \lim_{s\to\infty}u(s, t) = y(t), \\
  &\left|\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}(s, t)\right| \leq K e^{-\delta|s|},\quad 
  \quad\left|\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(s, t)-X_{H}(u)\right| \leq K e^{-\delta|s|}
  \}
  \end{align*}
  where $K, \delta > 0$ are constants depending on $u$.
  So 
  $$
  \abs{\del_s u(s, t)}, \abs{\del_t u(s, t) - X_H(u)}  \sim e^{\abs{s}}
  .$$

From the Appendices

- Relatively compact: has compact closure.
- Compact operator: the image of bounded sets are relatively compact.
- Index of an operator: $\dim \ker - \dim \coker$.
- Fredholm operators: those for which the index makes sense, i.e. $\dim \ker < \infty , \dim \coker < \infty$.
- Elliptic operators: generalize the Laplacian $\Delta$, coefficients of highest order derivatives are positive, principal symbol is invertible (???)
- Locally integrable: integrable on every compact subset
- Sobolev spaces: in dimension 1, define $\norm{u(t)}_{s, p} = \sum_{i=0}^s \norm{\del_t^i u(t)}_{L^p}$ on $C^\infty(\bar U)$, then take the completion and denote $W^{s, p}(\bar U)$.
  Yields a distribution space, elements are functions with weak derivatives.
- Distribution: $C_c^\infty(U)\dual$, the dual of the space of smooth compactly supported functions on an open set $U \subset \RR^n$.

# Review

## Definitions 

- The Floer equation is given by
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial s}+J(u) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+\operatorname{grad} H_{t}(u)=0
  .\end{align*}

- We fixed a solution and lifted it to a sphere:
$$
u \in C^\infty(S^1\cross \RR; W) \quad\mapsto\quad \tilde u \in C^\infty(S^2; W) 
$$ 

- We use the assumption: 
  
  > For every $w\in C^\infty(S^2, W)$ there exists a symplectic trivialization of the fiber bundle $w^* TW$, i.e. $\inner{c_1(TW)}{\pi_2(W)} = 0$ where $c_1$ denotes the first Chern class of the bundle $TW$.

- We use this trivialize the pullback $\tilde u ^* TW$ to obtain an orthonormal unitary frame $$\theset{Z_i}_{i=1}^{2n} \subset T_{u(s, t)} W$$ 

## The Frame 

- We used the chosen frame $\theset{Z_i}$ to define a chart centered at $u$ of $\mcp^{1, p}(x, y)$ given by
\begin{align*}
\iota: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow \mathcal{P}^{1, p}(x, y) \\
Y = \left(y_{1}, \dots, y_{2 n}\right) & \longmapsto \exp _{u}\left(\sum y_{i} Z_{i}\right)
.\end{align*}


- We regard $Y(s, t)$ as a tangent vector to $W$ in some Euclidean embedding.


## Charts 

- We seek to compute the composite map in charts:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height= 0.5\textheight]{figures/image_2020-04-16-01-11-02.png} 
\end{center}

## Add a Tangent

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&, matrix scale=0.002]
\mcf(u) =
\& \frac{\partial u}{\partial s} 
\& + J(u) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} 
\& - J(u)X_{t}(u) \\
\mathcal{F}(u+Y) =
\& \frac{\partial(u+Y)}{\partial s}
\&+ J(u+Y) \frac{\partial(u+Y)}{\partial t}
\&- J(u+Y) X_{t}(u+Y)
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Extract the part that is linear in $Y$ and collect terms:

\begin{align*}
&(d \mathcal{F})_{u}(Y)  \\
& = {\color{red}\frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}} +(d J)_{u}(Y) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + {\color{red} J(u) \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}} -(d J)_{u}(Y) X_{t}-J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}(Y) \\ 
& = 
\qty{ {\color{red}\frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}} + {\color{red} J(u) \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}}}  \\
& \hspace{2em} + \qty{ (d J)_{u}(Y) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - (d J)_{u}(Y) X_{t}-J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}(Y)} \\
.\end{align*}


# 8.4.1: Leibniz Rule 


## Leibniz Rule 
Recall the Leibniz rule $$(dJ)(Y) \cdot v = d(Jv)(Y) - J dv(Y)$$
\begin{align*}
(d \mathcal{F})_{u}(Y)
& = 
\qty{ {\color{red}\frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}} + {\color{red} J(u) \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}}}  \\
& \quad + \qty{ (d J)_{u}(Y) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - (d J)_{u}(Y) X_{t}-J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}(Y)} \\ 
&= \sum_{i=1}^{2n} \qty{ \dd{y_i}{s} Z_i + \dd{y_i}{t} J(u) Z_i} \\
& + \sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i \Bigg( \dd{Z_i}{s} + J(u) \dd{Z_i}{t} + (dJ)_u (Z_i) \dd{u}{t}  \\
&\hspace{5em}- J(u) (dX_t)_u Z_i - (dJ)_u (Z_i) X_t \Bigg)
.\end{align*}

Use the fact that this is $O_1 + O_0$ in $Y$.

## Order 1 

Study $O_1$ first, which (claim) reduces to 
  \begin{align*}
  O_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{2n} \qty{\dd{y_i}{s} + J_0 \dd{y_i}{t}  }Z_i = \bar \del(y_1, \cdots, y_{2n})
  .\end{align*}
  where $J_0$ is the standard complex structure on $\RR^{2n} = \CC^n$

Use this to write
\begin{align*}
(d\mcf)_u &= {\color{red} \bar \del Y} + SY
\end{align*}
where $S\in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; \endo(\RR^n))$ is a linear operator of order 0.

# Order 0 Part is Symmetric in the Limit

## 8.4.4: Order 0 Part is Symmetric in the Limit
Theorem (8.4.4, CR + Symmetric in the Limit)
:   If $u$ solves Floer's equation, then 
    $$
    (d\mcf)_u = \bar\del + S( s, t)
    $$ 
    where 

    1. $S$ is linear 
    2.  $S$ tends to a symmetric operator as $s\to \pm \infty$, and 
    3. We have the limiting behavior
    $$\dd{S}{s}(s, t)  \converges{s\to\pm\infty}\to 0 \qtext{uniformly in $t$}$$



## Proof

Collect terms in the order zero part:
\begin{align*}
O_0 = S(y_1, \cdots , y_{2n}) 
&= \sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i \Bigg[ {\color{orange} \dd{Z_i}{s}} + J(u) \dd{Z_i}{t} + {\color{blue} (dJ)_u (Z_i) \dd{u}{t}}  \\
&\hspace{5em}  - J(u) (dX_t)_u Z_i - {\color{blue} (dJ)_u (Z_i) X_t} \Bigg] \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i \Bigg[ {\color{orange} \dd{Z_i}{s} } + { \color{blue} (dJ)_u (Z_i) \qty{ \dd{u}{t} - (Z_i) X_t} } \\
&\hspace{5em} + {\color{red} J(u) \dd{Z_i}{t}  - J(u) (dX_t)_u Z_i} \Bigg]
.\end{align*}

- Claim: the terms in blue and orange vanish in the limit $s \to \pm \infty$, so it suffices to prove that the red term limits to a symmetric operator.

## Proof: Blue Term Vanishes

$$
{ \color{blue} (dJ)_u (Z_i) \qty{ \dd{u}{t} - (Z_i) X_t} } \to 0
$$

The term in blue vanishes: since $u$ is a solution and 
  
$$\dd{u}{s} \converges{s\to \pm \infty}\to 0 \qtext{uniformly}$$

as do its derivatives, we have

$$ \qty{ \dd{u}{t} - X_t(u)} \converges{s\to \pm\infty}\to 0 $$

> This seems to be the full argument for the blue term.

## Proof: Orange Term Vanishes (1 and 3)

$$
{\color{orange} \dd{Z_i}{s} } \converges{s\to \pm \infty}\to 0 
$$

Follows since the frame $Z_i$ was chosen such that 

$$\dd{}{s}, \quad \frac{\del^2}{\del s^2}, \quad \frac{\del^2}{\del s~\del t} \quad \actson Z_i \converges{s\to \pm\infty}\to 0\quad \text{for each } i$$

This also implies

$$ \dd{S}{s} \converges{s\to \pm\infty}\to 0.$$

> This shows parts (1) and (3) of the theorem: linearity and limits to zero uniformly in $t$?

## Proof: Symmetry

Write the remaining red term as 

\begin{align*}
A \definedas A\left(y_{1}, \ldots, y_{2 n}\right)=\sum y_{i}\left( {\color{red} J(u) \frac{\partial Z_{i}}{\partial t}-J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}\left(Z_{i}\right) } \right)
.\end{align*}


Extract the $j$th component:
\begin{align*}
A_j = \sum y_{i}\left\langle J(u) \frac{\partial Z_{i}}{\partial t}-J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}\left(Z_{i}\right), \quad Z_{j}\right\rangle
.\end{align*}

We'll show that
\begin{align*}
\lim _{s \rightarrow \pm \infty}
&\left\langle J(u) \frac{\partial Z_{\color{red} i}}{\partial t}-J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}\left(Z_{\color{red} i}\right), Z_{\color{red} j}\right\rangle \\
- &\left\langle J(u) \frac{\partial Z_{\color{red} j}}{\partial t}-J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u} Z_{\color{red}j}, ~~~Z_{\color{red} i}\right\rangle=0
.\end{align*}

## Proof: Symmetry

Use the fact that the frame $\theset{Z_i}$ is unitary:
\begin{align*}
0 &=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left\langle J(u) Z_{i}, Z_{j}\right\rangle \\
&=\left\langle(d J)_{u}\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\right) Z_{i}, Z_{j}\right\rangle+\left\langle J(u) \frac{\partial Z_{i}}{\partial t}, Z_{j}\right\rangle+\left\langle {\color{red} J(u) } Z_{i}, \frac{\partial Z_{j}}{\partial t}\right\rangle \\
&=
\left\langle(d J)_{u}\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\right) Z_{i}, Z_{j}\right\rangle+\left\langle J(u) \frac{\partial Z_{i}}{\partial t}, Z_{j}\right\rangle-\left\langle Z_{i}, {\color{red} J(u)} \frac{\partial Z_{j}}{\partial t}\right\rangle
.\end{align*}

## Proof: Symmetry

Therefore it suffices to show
\begin{align*}
-&\left\langle J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}\left(Z_{i}\right), \quad Z_{j}\right\rangle \\
+&\left\langle J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}\left(Z_{j}\right), \quad Z_{i}\right\rangle \\
-&\left\langle(d J)_{u}\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\right) Z_{i}, \quad Z_{j}\right\rangle \\ \\
&\converges{s\to \pm\infty}\to 0
.\end{align*}

## Proof: Symmetry

Using the fact that
\begin{align*}
\qty{ \dd{u}{t} - X_t(u)} \converges{s\to \pm\infty}\to 0
\end{align*}

we can equivalently show
\begin{align*}
&- \left\langle J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}\left(Z_{i}\right), \quad Z_{j}\right\rangle \\
&+ \left\langle J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u} \left(Z_{j}\right), \quad Z_{i}\right\rangle \\
&- \left\langle(d J)_{u}\left(X_{t}\right) Z_{i}, \hspace{2.5em} Z_{j}\right\rangle \\ \\
&\converges{s\to \pm\infty}\to 0
\end{align*}

> For a fixed $(s, t)$, this expression only depends on $Z_i$ at the point $u(s, t)$.


# Lemma That Concludes the Proof

## Lemma

**Lemma**: For $p\in W$, $\theset{Z_i}$ a unitary basis of $T_p W$, 
\begin{align*}
&- \left\langle J(p)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{p}\left(Z_{i}\right), \quad Z_{j}\right\rangle \\
&+ \left\langle J(p)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{p}\left(Z_{j}\right), \quad Z_{i}\right\rangle \\
&- \left\langle(d J)_{p}\left(X_{t}\right) Z_{i}, \hspace{2.5em} Z_{j}\right\rangle \\
&= 0
.\end{align*}

**Claim**:
This lemma immediately concludes the previous proof?

## Proof of Lemma

Extend $\theset{Z_i}$ to a chart containing $p$ and use the Leibniz rule to rewrite

\small
\begin{align*}
- \left\langle J(p)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{p}\left(Z_{i}\right), Z_{j}\right\rangle 
+ \left\langle J(p)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{p}\left(Z_{j}\right), Z_{i}\right\rangle 
- \left\langle(d J)_{p}\left(X_{t}\right) Z_{i}, Z_{j}\right\rangle 
= 0
\end{align*}
\normalsize
as
\footnotesize
\begin{align*}
&- \left\langle J\left(d X_{t}\right)\left(Z_{i}\right),Z_{j}\right\rangle 
+ \left\langle J\left(d X_{t}\right)\left(Z_{j}\right), Z_{i}\right\rangle
+ \left\langle J\left(d Z_{i}\right)\left(X_{t}\right), Z_{j}\right\rangle  
- {\color{red} \left\langle d\left(J Z_{i}\right)\left(X_{t}\right), Z_{j}\right\rangle } \\ \\
&=\left\langle J\left[X_{t}, Z_{i}\right], Z_{j}\right\rangle 
+ \left\langle J\left(d X_{t}\right)\left(Z_{j}\right), Z_{i}\right\rangle 
- {\color{red} \left\langle d\left(J Z_{i}\right)\left(X_{t}\right), Z_{j}\right\rangle }
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

where we'll rewrite the red terms.

## Proof of Lemma

\scriptsize

Now use
\begin{align*}
X_t \inner{JZ_i}{Z_j} = 0 
\implies
\left\langle d\left(J Z_{i}\right)\left(X_{t}\right), Z_{j}\right\rangle+\left\langle J Z_{i},\left(d Z_{j}\right)\left(X_{t}\right)\right\rangle=0
.\end{align*}

We now rewrite the RHS from before:
\begin{align*}
\left\langle J\left[X_{t}, Z_{i}\right], Z_{j}\right\rangle &+\left\langle J\left(d X_{t}\right)\left(Z_{j}\right), Z_{i}\right\rangle+\left\langle J Z_{i},\left(d Z_{j}\right)\left(X_{t}\right)\right\rangle \\ \\
&=\left\langle J\left[X_{t}, Z_{i}\right], Z_{j}\right\rangle+\left\langle J\left(d X_{t}\right)\left(Z_{j}\right)-J\left(d Z_{j}\right)\left(X_{t}\right), Z_{i}\right\rangle \\
&=\left\langle J\left[X_{t}, Z_{i}\right], Z_{j}\right\rangle-\left\langle J\left[X_{t}, Z_{j}\right], Z_{i}\right\rangle \\
&=\omega\left(\left[X_{t}, Z_{i}\right], Z_{j}\right)-\omega\left(\left[X_{t}, Z_{j}\right], Z_{i}\right)
.\end{align*}

The symmetry follows from $\omega$ being closed and
\begin{align*}
0
&= d \omega\left(X_{t}, Z_{i}, Z_{j}\right) \\
&= X_{t} \cdot \omega\left(Z_{i}, Z_{j}\right)-Z_{i} \cdot \omega\left(X_{t}, Z_{j}\right)+Z_{j} \cdot \omega\left(X_{t}, Z_{i}\right) \\
&\quad -\omega\left(\left[X_{t}, Z_{i}\right], Z_{j}\right)+\omega\left(\left[X_{t}, Z_{j}\right], Z_{i}\right)-\omega\left(\left[Z_{i}, Z_{j}\right], X_{t}\right) \\ \\
&= -X_{t} \cdot\left\langle Z_{i}, J Z_{j}\right\rangle+Z_{i} \cdot\left(d H_{t}\right)\left(Z_{j}\right)-Z_{j} \cdot\left(d H_{t}\right)\left(Z_{i}\right) \\
&\quad -\left(d H_{t}\right)\left(\left[Z_{i}, Z_{j}\right]\right)-\omega\left(\left[X_{t}, Z_{i}\right], Z_{j}\right)+\omega\left(\left[X_{t}, Z_{j}\right], Z_{i}\right) \\ \\
&= d\left(d H_{t}\right)\left(Z_{i}, Z_{j}\right)-\omega\left(\left[X_{t}, Z_{i}\right], Z_{j}\right)+\omega\left(\left[X_{t}, Z_{j}\right], Z_{i}\right) \\
&= -\omega\left(\left[X_{t}, Z_{i}\right], Z_{j}\right)+\omega\left(\left[X_{t}, Z_{j}\right], Z_{i}\right). \hspace{9em} \qed
\end{align*}

# 8.4.6: Linearization of Hamilton's Equation 

## Linearization of Hamilton's Equation 

Recall
$$
\qty{d\mcf}_u = \bar \del Y + SY = \qty{\bar \del + S}Y 
$$

Now think of $S$ as a map $Y \mapsto S\cdot Y$, so $S\in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; \endo(\RR^{2n}))$ and define the symmetric operators
$$
S^{\pm} \definedas  \lim_{s\to \pm\infty} S(s, \wait) \qtext{respectively}
$$

Theorem
:   The equation 
    $$
    \del_t Y = J_0 S^{\pm} Y
    $$ 
    is a linearization of Hamilton's equation 
    \begin{align*}
    \dd{z}{t} = X_t(z)\qtext{at} 
    \begin{cases}
    x = \lim_{s\to -\infty} u & \text{for } S^- \\
    y = \lim_{s\to \infty} u & \text{for } S^+
    \end{cases}\quad\text{respectively}
    .\end{align*}


## Proof

We first linearize Hamilton's equation at $x$:
\begin{align*}
\dd{z}{t} = X_t(z) \quad \stackrel{\text{linearized}}\implies \quad \dd{Y}{t} = (dX_t)_x Y
.\end{align*}

So write $Y = \sum y_i Z_i$ to obtain
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i} \frac{\partial y_{i}}{\partial t} Z_{i} &=\sum_{i} y_{i}\left(-\frac{\partial Z_{i}}{\partial t}+\left(d X_{t}\right)\left(Z_{i}\right)\right) \\
&=\sum_{i} \sum_{j} y_{i}\left\langle-\frac{\partial Z_{i}}{\partial t}+\left(d X_{t}\right)\left(Z_{i}\right), Z_{j}\right\rangle Z_{j} \\
&=\sum_{i} \sum_{j} y_{j}\left\langle-\frac{\partial Z_{i}}{\partial t}+\left(d X_{t}\right)\left(Z_{j}\right), Z_{i}\right\rangle Z_{i} \\ \\
\implies
\frac{\partial y_{i}}{\partial t}
&=\sum_{j}\left\langle-\frac{\partial Z_{j}}{\partial t}+\left(d X_{t}\right)\left(Z_{j}\right), Z_{i}\right\rangle y_{j}
.\end{align*}

## Proof

Thus we can rewrite the linearized equation as
\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
\dd{Y}{t} = (dX_t)_x Y = B^- \cdot Y, \quad 
b_{i j}=\left\langle-\frac{\partial Z_{j}}{\partial t}+\left(d X_{t}\right)_{x}\left(Z_{j}\right), Z_{i}\right\rangle
.\end{align*}
\normalsize 

Recall
\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
A \definedas A\left(y_{1}, \ldots, y_{2 n}\right)=\sum y_{i}\left( {\color{red} J(u) \frac{\partial Z_{i}}{\partial t}-J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}\left(Z_{i}\right) } \right)
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

Now take $s\to -\infty$ and look at the order zero part of $(d\mcf)_u$.
By the proof of 8.4.4, we have
\scriptsize
\begin{align*}
A\left(\sum y_{i} Z_{i}\right) &=\sum_{i}\left(J(x) \frac{\partial Z_{i}}{\partial t}-J(x)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{x}\left(Z_{i}\right)\right) \\
&=\sum_{i} \sum_{j} y_{i}\left\langle J \frac{\partial Z_{i}}{\partial t}-J\left(d X_{t}\right)\left(Z_{i}\right), Z_{j}\right\rangle Z_{j} \\
&=\sum_{i} \sum_{j} y_{j}\left\langle J \frac{\partial Z_{j}}{\partial t}-J\left(d X_{t}\right)\left(Z_{j}\right), Z_{i}\right\rangle Z_{i} \\
&=\sum_{i} \sum_{j}\left\langle-\frac{\partial Z_{j}}{\partial t}+\left(d X_{t}\right)\left(Z_{j}\right), J Z_{i}\right\rangle {y_{j}} Z_{i}
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

## Proof

Deduce that 
\begin{align*}
S = (s_{ij}),\quad & s_{ij} = \left\langle-\frac{\partial Z_{j}}{\partial t}+\left(d X_{t}\right)_{x}\left(Z_{j}\right), ~~J(x) Z_{i}\right\rangle \\ \\ \\
JZ_i = \begin{cases}
Z_{i+n} & i \leq n \\
-Z_{i-n} & i \geq n+1
\end{cases}
&\implies 
s_{ij} = 
\begin{cases}
b_{i+n, j} & i \leq n \\
-b_{i-n, j} & i \geq n+1
\end{cases} \\ \\
&\iff S^- = - J_0 B^- 
.\end{align*}

# Talk

Overview:
Analyze the space $\mcm(x, y)$ of solutions to the Floer equation connecting two orbits $x, y$ of $H$.
Show $\mcm(x, y)$ is in fact a manifold of dimension $\mu(x) - \mu(y)$.

Strategy:

1. Describe $\mcm(x, y)$ as the zero set of a section of a vector bundle over the Banach manifold $\mcp(x, y)$.
2. Apply the Sard-Smale theorem: perturb $H$ to make $\mcm(x, y)$ the inverse image of a regular value of some map.
3. Show that the tangent maps (?) are Fredholm operators of index $\mu(x) - \mu(y) = \dim \mcm(x, y)$.

Goals:

- 8.3: Overview and big picture
- 8.4: Formula for linearization of $\mcf$.

## 8.3: The Space of Perturbations of $H$

Goal: given a fixed Hamiltonian $H\in C^\infty(W\cross S^1; \RR)$, perturb it (without modifying the periodic orbits) so that $\mcm(x, y)$ are manifolds of the expected dimension.

Start by trying to construct a subspace $\mcc_\eps^{\infty}(H) \subset \mcc^\infty(W\cross S^1; \RR)$, the space of perturbations of $H$ depending on a certain sequence $\eps = \theset{\eps_k}$, and show it is a dense subspace.

![](figures/image_2020-04-14-23-36-58.png)\

Idea: similar to how you build $L^2(\RR)$, define a norm $\norm{\wait}_\eps$ on $C_\eps^{\infty}(H)$ and take the subspace of finite-norm elements.

- Let $h(\vector x, t) \in C_\eps^\infty(H)$ denote a perturbation of $H$.
- Fix $\eps = \theset{\eps_k \mid k\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}} \subset \RR^{>0}$ a sequence of real numbers, which we will choose carefully later.

- For a fixed $\vector x \in W, t\in \RR$ and $k \in \ZZ^{\geq 0}$, define 
  $$
  \abs{d^k h(\vector x, t)} = \max \theset {d^\alpha h(\vector x, t) \suchthat \abs{\alpha} = k}
  ,$$
  the maximum over all sets of multi-indices $\alpha$ of length $k$.

  > Note: I interpret this as 
  $$
  d^{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \cdots, \alpha_k}h = \frac{\del^k h}{\del x_{\alpha_1} ~\del x_{\alpha_2} \cdots \del x_{\alpha_k}}
  ,$$
  the partial derivatives wrt the corresponding variables.

- Define a norm on $C^\infty(W\cross S^1; \RR)$:

  \begin{align*}
  \|h\|_{\vector \eps}
  &= \sum_{k \geq 0} \eps_{k} \sup _{(x, t) \in W \times S^{1}}\left|d^{k} h(x, t)\right|
  .\end{align*}

- Since $W\cross S^1$ is assumed compact (?), fix a finite covering $\theset{B_i}$ of $W\cross S^1$ such that 
  $$
  \union_i B_i^\circ = W \cross S^1
  .$$

  - Choose them in such a way we obtain charts 
    \begin{align*}
    \Psi_i: B_i &\to \bar{B(0, 1)} \subset \RR^{2n + 1} ~(?)
    .\end{align*}
  
- Obtain the computable form
  \begin{align*}
  \norm{h}_{\vector \eps} &= \sum_{k \geq 0} \eps_{k} \sup _{(x, t) \in W \times S^{1}} \sup_{i, z\in B(0, 1)} \abs{ d^k (h\circ \Psi_i\inv)(z)}
  .\end{align*}

- Define 
    $$
    C_\eps^\infty = \theset{h\in C^\infty(W\cross S^1; \RR) \suchthat \norm{h}_\eps < \infty} \subset C^{\infty}(W\cross S^1; \RR)
    ,$$ 
   which is a Banach space (normed and complete). 

- Show that the sequence $\theset{\eps_k}$ can be chosen so that $C_\eps^\infty$ is a *dense* subspace for the $C^\infty$ topology, and in particular for the $C^1$ topology.


Proposition
: Such a sequence $\theset {\eps_k}$ can be chosen.

Lemma
: $C^\infty(W \cross S^1; \RR)$ with the $C^1$ topology is separable as a topological space (contains a countable dense subset).

Proof (of Lemma, Sketch)
:   \hfill
    First prove for $C^0$:

    - **Idea:** reduce to polynomials in $\RR^m$.
    - Embed $W\cross S^1 \injects [-M, M]^m \cong I^m \subset \RR^m$ for some large $m$, reduces to proving it for $C^\infty(I^m; \RR)$.
    - Recall Stone-Weierstrass: 
      
      > For $A\leq C^0(X; \RR)$ a subalgebra with $X$ compact Hausdorff and $A$ containing a nonzero constant function, $A$ is dense iff it separates points (for all $a\neq b\in X$ there exists $f\in A$ such that $f(a) \neq f(b)$) 

    - Apply to $A = \QQ[x_1, \cdots, x_m]$ the subalgebra of polynomial functions, the nonzero constant function $c(x) = 1$, and show it separates points via $f(x) = x-a$, then $f(a) = 0$ and $f(b) = a-b \neq 0$ by assumption.
    
    - Thus $A$ is a countable dense subset.

    \

    Then prove for $C^1$:

    - **Idea**: Take polynomials convolved with a countable sequence of bump functions, which is still a countable dense subset.
    
    - Choose a smooth bump function $\chi$ supported on $B(0, 1)$
    
    - Define the sequence $\chi_k(x) \definedas k^m \chi(kx)$.
    
    - Prove that $(f\ast \chi_k) \converges{k\to\infty}\to f$ in the $C_\loc^0$ sense (?)
    
    - Show that for a fixed $k$, any other sequence $g_\ell \to f$ in $C_\loc^\infty$, we have $g_\ell \ast \chi_k \to f \ast \chi_k$ in the $C_\loc^0$ sense using 
    $$
    \abs{g_\ell - f} \to 0 \implies \sup_K \abs{\dd{}{x_i} (g_\ell - f) \ast \chi_k} \leq \sup_k \abs{g_\ell - f} \cdot (\cdots) \to 0 \quad \forall i
    $$
    
    - Conclude $\lim_\ell \lim_k g_\ell \ast \chi_k = f$.
    
    - Taking $g_\ell$ to be polynomial approximations, the following subset is countable and dense:
    $$
    \union_{k\in \ZZ^{\geq 0}} \theset{P\ast \chi_k \suchthat P \in \QQ[x_1, \cdots, x_m]}
    $$
    which are pushed through the charts $\Psi_i$ to actually compute.

The second part of this proof generalizes to $C^\infty$.

Proof (of Proposition, Sketch)
:   \hfill

    - By the lemma, produce a sequence $\theset{f_n} \subset C^\infty(W\cross S^1; \RR)$ dense for the $C^1$ topology.
    
    - Using the norm on $C^n(W\cross S^1; \RR)$ for the $f_n$, define
    
      \begin{align*}
      \frac 1 {\eps_n} = 2^n \displaystyle\max \theset {\norm{f_k} \suchthat k\leq n}
      \implies \eps_n \sup \abs{d^n f_k(x, t)} \leq 2^{-n}
      \end{align*}

      which is summable.

> Why does this imply density? I don't know.

The next proposition establishes a version of this theorem with compact support:

Proposition
: For any $(\vector x, t) \subset U \in W \cross S^1)$ there exists a $V\subset U$ such that every $h\in C^{\infty}(W\cross S^1; \RR)$ can be approximated in the $C^1$ topology by functions in $C_\eps^\infty$ supported in $U$.

Then fix a time-dependent Hamiltonian $H_0$ with nondegenerate periodic orbits and consider 
$$
\theset{ h\in C_\eps^\infty(H_0) \suchthat h(x, t) = 0 \text{ in some $U\supseteq$ the 1-periodic orbits of $H_0$}}
$$
Then $\supp(h)$ is "far" from $\per(H_0)$, so 
$$
\norm{h}_\eps \ll 1 \implies \per(H_0 + h) = \per(H_0)
$$ 
and are both nondegenerate.

## Review 8.2

What is $\mcf$?

We started with the unadorned Floer map:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{F}: \mathcal{C}^{\infty}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; W\right) & \to \mathcal{C}^{\infty}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; T W\right) \\
u & \mapsto \frac{\partial u}{\partial s}+J \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+\operatorname{grad}_{u}\left(H_{t}\right)
\end{align*}

and promoted this to a map of Banach spaces
\begin{align*}
\mcf: \mcp^{1, p}(x, y) &\to \mcl^p(x, y) \\
\mathcal{F}(u) &= \frac{\partial u}{\partial s}+J(u) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+\operatorname{grad} H_{t}(u)
.\end{align*}

What is the LHS?
It is the space of maps
\begin{align*}
\mcp^{1, p}(x, y): ? &\to ? \\
(s, t) &\mapsto \exp_{w(s, t)} Y(s, t)
.\end{align*}

where $Y \in W^{1, p}(w^* TW)$ and $w\in C^\infty_{\searrow}(x, y)$.



## 8.4: Linearizing the Floer equation: The Differential of $\mcf$

Choose $m> n = \dim (W)$ and embed $TW \injects \RR^m$ to identify tangent vectors (such as $Z_i$, tangents to $W$ along $u$ or in a neighborhood $B$ of $u$) with actual vectors in $\RR^m$.

> Why? Bypasses differentiating vector fields and the Levi-Cevita connection.

We can then identify 
$$
\im \mcf = C^\infty (\RR \cross S^1; \RR^m) \qtext{or} L^p(\RR\cross S^1; W)
,$$ 
and we seek to compute its differential $d \mcf$.

> We've just replaced the codomain here.

Recall that 

- $x, y$ are contractible loops in $W$ that are nondegenerate critical points of the action functional $\mca_H$, 
- $u \in \mcm(x, y) \subset C_\loc^\infty$ denotes a fixed solution to the Floer equation, 
- $C_{\searrow}(x ,y)$ was the set of solutions $u: \RR\cross S^1 \to W$ satisfying some conditions.

> Recall:
> \begin{align*}
C_{\searrow}(x, y) \definedas \{
u \in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; W) \suchthat 
&\lim_{s\to -\infty}u(s, t) = x(t),\quad 
\lim_{s\to\infty}u(s, t) = y(t)
\} \\
&\abs{\dd{u}{t}(s, t)} \quad \text{and}\quad \abs{\dd{u}{t}(s, t) - X_H(u)}  \sim \exp(\abs{s})
\end{align*}


Fix a solution
$$
u\in \mcm(x, y) \subset C_{\loc}^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; W)
.$$

We lift each solution to a map 
$$
\tilde u: S^2 \to W
$$ 
in the following way:
the loops $x, y$ are contractible, so they bound discs.
So we extend by pushing these discs out slightly::

![](figures/image_2020-04-15-18-10-40.png)\

From earlier in the book, we have

**Assumption (6.22)**:

For every $w\in C^\infty(S^2, W)$ there exists a symplectic trivialization of the fiber bundle $w^* TW$, i.e. $\inner{c_1(TW)}{\pi_2(W)} = 0$ where $c_1$ denotes the first Chern class of the bundle $TW$.

> Note: I don't know what this pairing is. The top Chern class is the Euler class (obstructs nowhere zero sections) and are defined inductively: 
$$
c_1(TW) = e(\Lambda^n(TW)) \in H^2(W; \ZZ)
$$
> Assumption is satisfied when all maps $S^2 \to W$ lift to $B^3$ $\iff \pi_2(W) = 0$.


We have a pullback that is a symplectic fiber bundle:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\tilde u^* TW \ar[r, "d\tilde u"] \ar[d]
\arrow[dr, phantom, "\scalebox{1.5}{\color{black}$\lrcorner$}" , very near start, color=black]
& TW\ar[d] \\
S^2 \ar[r, "\tilde u"] & W
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

- Using the assumption, trivialize the pullback $\tilde u ^* TW$ to obtain an orthonormal unitary frame $$\theset{Z_i}_{i=1}^{2n} \subset T_{u(s, t)} W$$ where
  - The frame depends smoothly on $(s, t) \in S^2$, 
  - $\lim_{s\to \infty} Z_i$ exists for each $i$.
  - $$\dd{}{s}, \quad \frac{\del^2}{\del s^2}, \quad \frac{\del^2}{\del s~\del t} \quad \actson Z_i \converges{s\to \pm\infty}\to 0\quad \text{for each } i$$

  > Claim: such trivializations exist, "using cylinders near the spherical caps in the figure".

> Recall what $\mcp^{1, p}(x, y), J, X_t$ are here.
 
- Use this frame to define a chart centered at $u$ of $\mcp^{1, p}(x, y)$ given by
\begin{align*}
\iota: W^{1, p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{2 n}\right) & \longrightarrow \mathcal{P}^{1, p}(x, y) \\
\vector{y} = \left(y_{1}, \dots, y_{2 n}\right) & \longmapsto \exp _{u}\left(\sum y_{i} Z_{i}\right)
.\end{align*}

  - Note that the derivative at zero is $\sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i Z_i$.

- Define and compute the differential of the composite map $\tilde\mcf$ defined as follows:
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
  \mathcal{P}^{1, p}(x, y) \ar[r, "\mathcal{F}"] \ar[rr, dotted, "\tilde \mcf", bend left]
  & L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; T W\right) \ar[r]
  & L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; \mathbb{R}^{m}\right) \\
  u \ar[rr, "\tilde \mcf"] & &\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}+J(u)\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-X_{t}(u)\right)
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}

  - From now on, let $\mcf$ denote $\tilde \mcf$.

- Take the vector $$Y(s, t) \definedas (y_1(s, t), \cdots) \in \RR^{2n} \subset \RR^m$$
  
    - View $Y$ as a vector in $\RR^m$ tangent to $W$, given by $Y = \sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i Z_i$.

- Plug $u + Y$ into the equation for $\mcf$, directly yielding
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=0.1em]
  \mcf(u) =
  & \frac{\partial u}{\partial s} 
  & + J(u) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} 
  & - J(u)X_{t}(u) \\
  \implies \mathcal{F}(u+Y) =
  & \frac{\partial(u+Y)}{\partial s}
  &+ J(u+Y) \frac{\partial(u+Y)}{\partial t}
  &- J(u+Y) X_{t}(u+Y)
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}

- Extract the part that is linear in $Y$ and collect terms:
  \begin{align*}
  (d \mathcal{F})_{u}(Y)
  & = {\color{red}\frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}} +(d J)_{u}(Y) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + {\color{red} J(u) \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}} -(d J)_{u}(Y) X_{t}-J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}(Y) \\ \\ 
  & = 
  \qty{ {\color{red}\frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}} + {\color{red} J(u) \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}}} +  
  \qty{ (d J)_{u}(Y) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - (d J)_{u}(Y) X_{t}-J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}(Y)} \\
  .\end{align*}

  - This is a sum of two differential operators:
    - One of order 1, one of order 0 (Perspective 1)
    - The Cauchy-Riemann operator, and one of order zero (Perspective 2, not immediate from this form)

- Now compute in charts. Need a lemma:

Lemma (Leibniz Rule)
:   For any source space $X$ and any maps
    \begin{align*}
    J: X &\to \endo(\RR^m) \\
    Y, v: X &\to \RR^m
    \end{align*}
    
    we have
    \begin{align*}
    (dJ)(Y) \cdot v = d(Jv)(Y) - J dv(Y)
    .\end{align*}

Proof
:   Differentiate the map 
    \begin{align*}
    J\cdot v: X &\to \RR^m \\
    x &\mapsto J(x)\cdot v(x)
    \end{align*}

    to obtain
    \begin{align*}
    J(x + Y) v(x + y) &= \qty{J(x) + (dJ)_{x} (Y) } ~\cdot~ \qty{v(x) + (dv)_x(Y)} + \cdots \\
    &= J(x) \cdot v(x) + {\color{blue} J(x) \cdot (dv)_x(Y) + (dJ)_x(Y) \cdot v(x)} + (dJ)_x(Y)\cdot (dv)_x(Y) + \cdots \\ \\ 
    \implies d(J\cdot v)_x(Y) &=  (dJ)_x(Y) \cdot v(x) + J(x) \cdot (dv)_x(Y) 
    .\end{align*}

- Using the chart $\iota$ defined by $\theset{Z_i}$ to write $Y = \sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i Z_i$ and thus
  \begin{align*}
  (d\mcf)_u(Y) = O_0 + O_1 
  \end{align*}
  where $O_0$ are order 0 terms ("they do not differentiate the $y_i$") and the $O_1$ are order 1 terms:
  \begin{align*}
  O_1 &= \sum_{i=1}^{2n} \qty{ \dd{y_i}{s} Z_i + \dd{y_i}{t} J(u) Z_i}  \\ \\
  O_0 &= \sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i \qty{ \dd{Z_i}{s} + J(u) \dd{Z_i}{t} + (dJ)_u (Z_i) \dd{u}{t}  - J(u) (dX_t)_u Z_i - (dJ)_u (Z_i) X_t }
  .\end{align*}

> Note: the book seems to be incorrect here, or at least ambiguously worded: 
![](figures/image_2020-04-15-20-31-48.png)\

- Study $O_1$ first, which (claim) reduces to 
  \begin{align*}
  O_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{2n} \qty{\dd{y_i}{s} + J_0 \dd{y_i}{t}  }Z_i = \bar \del(y_1, \cdots, y_{2n})
  .\end{align*}
  where $J_0$ is the standard complex structure on $\RR^{2n} = \CC^n$

  - The second equality follows from the assumption that the $Z_i$ are symplectic and orthonormal.

  - Note that this writes $(d\mcf)_u(Y) = O_0 + O_{CR}$, a sum of an order zero and a Cauchy-Riemann operator.


- Note that since we've computed in charts, we have actually computed the differential of $\mcf_u$ in the following diagram
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
  W^{1, p}(\RR \cross S^1; \RR^{2n})  \ar[rrr, dashed, "\mathcal{F}_u", bend left] \ar[r, "\iota"] & \mathcal{P}^{1, p}(x, y) \ar[r, "\mathcal{F}"] \ar[rr, dotted, "\tilde \mcf", bend left=20]
  & L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1} ; T W\right) \ar[r]
  & L^{p}\left(\mathbb{R} \times S^{1\} ; \mathbb{R}^{m}\right) \\
   & u \ar[rr, "\tilde \mcf"] & &\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}+J(u)\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-X_{t}(u)\right) \\
  \left(y_{1}, \dots, y_{2 n}\right)\ar[r] &  \exp _{u}\left(\sum y_{i} Z_{i}\right)
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  So we've technically computed $(dF_\mu)_0$.

- Remark on the decomposition
  \begin{align*}
(d\mcf)_u &= 
  \qty{ {\color{red}\frac{\partial Y}{\partial s}} + {\color{red} J(u) \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}}} +  
  \qty{ (d J)_{u}(Y) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - (d J)_{u}(Y) X_{t}-J(u)\left(d X_{t}\right)_{u}(Y)}  \\ \\
  &\definedas {\color{red} \bar \del Y} + SY
  \end{align*}
  where $S\in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; \endo(\RR^n))$ is a linear operator of order 0.


Proposition (8.4.4, CR + Symmetric in the Limit)
:   If $u$ solves Floer's equation, then 
    $$
    (d\mcf)_u = \bar\del + S( s, t)
    $$ 
    where 

    - $S$ is linear 
    - $S$ tends to a symmetric operator as $s\to \pm \infty$, and 
    - $$\dd{S}{s}(s, t)  \converges{s\to\pm\infty}\to 0 \qtext{uniformly in $t$}$$

Proof
:   Omitted -- $S$ is exactly $O_0$ from before:
    \begin{align*}
    O_0 &= \sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i \qty{ \dd{Z_i}{s} + J(u) \dd{Z_i}{t} + {\color{blue} (dJ)_u (Z_i) \dd{u}{t}}  - J(u) (dX_t)_u Z_i - {\color{blue} (dJ)_u (Z_i) X_t} } \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{2n} y_i \qty{ \dd{Z_i}{s} + { \color{blue} (dJ)_u (Z_i) \qty{ \dd{u}{t} - (Z_i) X_t} } + J(u) \dd{Z_i}{t}  - J(u) (dX_t)_u Z_i }
    .\end{align*}

    - The term in blue vanishes as $s\to \pm \infty$ 
      - Using the fact that $u$ is a solution 
      - Uses $\dd{u}{s} \to 0$ uniformly (as do its derivatives?)
    - Suffices to show the remaining part is symmetric in the limit, i.e. write as 
      \begin{align*}
      A(y_1, \cdots, y_{2n}) = \cdots \implies A_{ij} = A_{ji}
      \end{align*}
      using inner product calculations
    - Uses the fact the $Z_i$ needed to be chosen to be unitary and symplectic.

- Write $O_1$ as a map $Y \mapsto S\cdot Y$, so $S\in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; \endo(\RR^{2n}))$ and define the symmetric operators
  $$
  S^{\pm} \definedas  \lim_{s\to \pm\infty} S(s, \wait) \qtext{respectively}
  $$

Proposition
:   The equation 
    $$
    \del_t Y = J_0 S^{\pm} Y
    $$ 
    linearizes Hamilton's equation 
    \begin{align*}
    \dd{z}{t} = X_t(z)\qtext{at} 
    \begin{cases}
    x = \lim_{s\to -\infty} u & \text{for } S^- \\
    y = \lim_{s\to \infty} u & \text{for } S^+
    \end{cases}\quad\text{respectively}
    .\end{align*}

![](figures/image_2020-04-15-21-53-36.png) \

Proof
:   Omitted. Sketch:

    - Use the fact that $\dd{Y}{t} = (dX_t)_x Y$
    - Expand $\sum \dd{y_i}{t} Z_i$ in the $Z_i$ basis (roughly) to write $\dd{y_i}{t} = \sum b_{ij} y_j$ for some coefficients $b_{ij}$.
    - Collect terms into a matrix/operator $B^\mp$ for $x,y$ respectively to write $$\dd{Y}{t} = B^- \cdot Y$$
    - Write $(d\mcf)_u = \bar \del + S$ where $S$ is zero order and symmetric in the limit
    - Get the corresponding operator $A$ in coordinates
    - Expand in a basis (roughly) as $A(\sum y_i Z_i) = \sum s_{ij} y_j Z_i$
    - Check that $s_{ij} = \pm b_{i\pm n, j}$
    - This implies $$S^- = - J_0 B^- \quad S^+ = -J_0 B^+ \implies \dd{Y}{t} = J_0 S^\pm Y$$


- Given a solution $u$, we have a right $\RR\dash$action, so for $s\in \RR$, 
\begin{align*}
u \cdot s \in C^\infty(\RR\cross S^1; W) \\ 
(\sigma, t) \mapsto u(\sigma + s, t)
\end{align*}
is also a solution, so $\mcf(u \cdot s) = 0$ for all $s$.
  - In other words: we can flow solutions?

- **Punchline**:
  **$\dd{u}{s}$ is a solution of the linearized equation**, since
  \begin{align*}
  0 = \dd{}{s} \mcf (u\cdot s) = (d\mcf)_u \qty{\dd{u}{s}}
  .\end{align*}

  - Along any nonconstant solution connecting $x$ and $y$, $\dim \ker (d\mcf)_u \geq 1$.

# Griffiths and Morgan

Overall purpose: want to relate $C^\infty$ forms on a manifold to AT invariants. One significant result: given a manifold $M$, the singular cohomology $H^*(M, \RR)$ is isomorphic to the cohomology of the differential graded algebra of $C^\infty$ forms, $H^*_{DR}(M)$.

> Is this de Rham cohomology..?

This DGA of smooth forms is actually enough to calculate all of the AT invariants, and can be used to build the Postnikov tower of $M$ ($\tensor \RR$)

One construction is the localization of a CW complex at $\QQ$, this removes torsion and divisibility phenomena. The effect on the Postnikov tower is just then tensoring with $\QQ$.

Things that are homotopy equivalent to CW complexes:

- Manifolds
- Varieties
- Loop spaces of CW complexes
- Eilenberg-MacLane spaces? $K(\pi, n)$.

The Whitehead theorem holds for these:
$X \mapsvia{f} Y$ is an homotopy equivalence iff $\pi_*(X) \mapsvia{f_*} \pi_*(Y)$ is an isomorphism.

Recall the weak topology for infinite CW complex: $U$ is open in $X$ iff $U \cap X^n$ is open for every $n$.

Theorem: Given any $X \mapsvia{f} Y$, we can transform this into an inclusion up to homotopy equivalence. (Just replace $Y$ my the mapping cylinder of $f$, denoted $M_f \homotopic Y$).

A fibration is anything that satisfies the homotopy lifting property. Examples:

- Locally trivial fiber bundles
- Vector bundles
- Covering spaces

Path spaces are contractible and yield fibrations.

Homology can be defined with coefficients in any abelian group by tensoring the singular chain groups with $G$. That is, if we $H_*(X)$ obtained from

$\mapsvia{\del_{n+1}} C_n(X) \mapsvia{\del_n} C_{n-1}(X) \mapsvia{\del_{n-1}} C_{n-2}(X) \cdots \mapsvia{\del_1} C_0(X)$

then we can define $H_*(X; G)$ via

$\mapsvia{\del_{n+1}\otimes 1} C_n(X)\otimes G \mapsvia{\del_n\otimes 1} C_{n-1}(X) \otimes G \cdots \mapsvia{\del_1\otimes 1} C_0(X) \otimes G$

Note that homology has the structure of a graded group, while cohomology has the structure of a graded commutative ring.

Axioms of homology:

- $X \mapsvia{f} Y$ always induces a map on homology $H_*(X) \mapsvia{f_*}H_*(Y)$
- An orientation on $S^n$ induces an isomorphism $H_n(S^n) \cong \ZZ$; reversing orientation induces the map $\ZZ \mapsvia{\phi}\ZZ: \phi(1) = -1$
- $Y\subseteq X$ yields the definition of relative homology $H_*(X, Y)$, and Mayer Vietoris holds; i.e. there is a long exact sequence
  $\cdots H_n(Y) \into H_n(X) \into H_n(X, Y) \into H_{n-1}(Y) \cdots$
- Excision: $U \subset Y \subset X$ and $\bar U \subset Y^\circ$ implies $H_*(X-U, Y-U) \cong H_*(X,Y)$.

Any homology theory satisfying these properties is equivalent to singular homology.

Use notation $[X, Y]$ for homotopy classes of maps $X\into Y$, then $\pi_1(X) = [S^1, X]$ and we can define $\pi_n(X) = [S^n, X]$. Homotopy groups fail excision.

Whitehead theorem: for CW complexes, if $X \mapsvia{f} Y$ induces $\pi_n(X) \mapsvia{f_*} \pi_n(Y)$ and $f_*$ is an isomorphism (and $Y$ is connected), then $f$ is a homotopy equivalence. For spaces that aren't CW complexes, this may fail, and we say $f$ is a *weak homotopy equivalence* instead.

Hurewicz theorem: the bottom homology and homotopy groups are isomorphic, and homology below the bottom homology is zero.

General note: there are equivalent "relative versions" of most of these theorems.

**Spectral Sequence:** Page 45.

For any fibration $F \mapsvia{} E \mapsvia{\pi} B$, we get a LES in homotopy
$\pi_n(F) \into \pi_n(E) \into \pi_n(B) \mapsvia{\del} \pi_{n-1}(F)$

Basic question: How are the cohomologies of $F,E,B$ related? An easy case is when $E=F\cross B$, but even then $\pi_n(F\cross B) \neq \pi_n(F) \oplus \pi_n(B)$. Need the Kunneth theorem, formula is more complicated.

For CW complexes and a fibration, the relationship is nice - look at the total space of the fibration. It is filtered by increasing $n$-skeleta, and we use the LES. More general filtrations need a spectral sequence.

*Note: use LES as trivial example of spectral sequence! Write out the pages, differentials, etc*

The spectral sequence relates the cohomology of *successive pairs* in the filtration to the cohomology of the total space.

**Theorem**: If $B$ is path-connected and $\pi_1(B, b_0)$ acts trivially on $H^*(F)$, then there are isomorphisms
$$
H^n(E^p, E^{p-1}) \cong \prod_{\text{$p$-cells in $B$}} H^n(\pi^{-1}e^p, \pi^{-1}\del e^p) \\ \cong C^p(B; H^{n-p}(F))
$$
In other words, for any $k$, we can think of $H^*(E^p, E^{p-k})$ as a $k$-th approximation to $H^*(E^p)$.

(Should probably review results about polynomial and exterior algebras. And what does it mean for $\pi_1$ to act trivially on a fiber?)

**EXAMPLES OF COMPUTATION: Page 54**

- Cohomology of $\CP^n$ using $S^1 \into S^{2n+1} \into \CP^n$
- Cohomology of the infinite Grassmannian $\lim_n G(k, n)$

## Postnikov Towers

A decomposition dual to cell decomposition, the atoms of the space are Eilenberg-Maclane spaces $K(\pi, n)$. (Note the spheres are atomic in homology, while the $K$ are atomic in homotopy.)

Gives a way of going back and forth between $X$ and $\pi_*(X)$: defined as a tower of spaces $X_0 \leftarrow X_1 \leftarrow \cdots$

- $X_{i-1} \leftarrow X_i$ is a fibration
- $\pi_k(X_n) = \mathbb{1}[k \leq n]\cdot\pi_k(X) + \mathbb{1}[k > n]\cdot 0$
  - So all lower homotopy groups agree at the $n$-th spot
- (Probably) $X_i \injects X$

Unique up to homotopy, $X = \lim_n X_n$ (an inverse limit). Essentially constructs $X$ out of $K(\pi_n(X), n)$.

*Note: revisit and draw diagrams for Postnikov Towers*

Homotopy and homology commute with direct limits.

$(\cdot \tensor \QQ)$ is a right-exact functor, most results in this section are about how terms in exact sequences all become $\QQ$-vector spaces. 
In particular, $H^*(X; \QQ), H_*(X;\QQ)$ are.

Homotopy theory over $\QQ$ is much easier than over $\ZZ$. 
Sample results:
$$
\pi_i(S^{2n-1}) \otimes \QQ = \begin{cases}
\QQ & i=2n-1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Then using the fact that $\pi_i(S^{2n-1})$ is always finitely generated, we can conclude
$$
\pi_i(S^{2n-1}) = \begin{cases}
\ZZ & i=2n-1 \\
\text{a finite group}  ~G & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
This yields for even $n$:
$$
\pi_i(S^{n})  = \begin{cases}
\ZZ & i=n \\
\ZZ \oplus G & i=2n-1 \\
H & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
for some finite groups $G,H$!

Can also obtain Bott Periodicity this way.

# Applications of Spectral Sequences

## Notation and Remarks

- For $M$ a manifold, $T(M)$ is the unit tangent bundle of $M$
- For $R$ a ring $R\delta_i$ denotes a copy of $R$ appearing in the $i$th (co)homological degree
- $S^n \subset \RR^{n+1}$ and $S^{2n-1} \subset \CC^n$
- Theorem: $F \to E \to B$ a fibration results in
  $E_2^{p,q} = H^p(B, H^q(F; G)) = H^p(B;G) \tensor H^q(F; G)$
  for nice enough spaces $X$ and groups $G$
  - Corollary: $H^n(X\cross Y) = \displaystyle\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H^p(X, H^q(Y))$
- Facts about tensor products
  - $(rm)\tensor n = r(m\tensor n) =m \tensor(rn)$
  - $(r+s)(m\tensor n) = rm\tensor n + sm\tensor n$
  - $\ZZ_p \tensor_\ZZ \ZZ_q = \ZZ/\gcd(p,q)$ and $\gcd(p,q) = 1$ yields 0.
  - Some computations:
    - $\ZZ_n \tensor_\ZZ \QQ = 0$
    - $\ZZ_n \tensor_\ZZ \QQ/\ZZ = 0$
    - $\QQ \tensor_\ZZ \QQ = \QQ$
    - $(\QQ/\ZZ)\tensor_\ZZ \QQ = 0$
    - $\QQ/\ZZ \tensor_\ZZ \QQ/\ZZ = 0$
    - $R[x]\tensor_R S \cong S[x]$
    - $k \into K$ a field extension: $k[x]/(f) \tensor_k K \cong K[x]/(f)$
  - Symmetric, Associative
  - $(\oplus A_i )\tensor B = \oplus(A_i \tensor B)$
  - $\ZZ \tensor A = A$
  - $\ZZ_n \tensor A = \frac{A}{nA}$

# Generalized Topological Poincaré Conjecture

When is a homotopy sphere also a topological sphere? 

When does $\pi_* X \cong_{Grp} \pi_* S^n \implies X \cong_{Top} S^n$?

- $n=1$: True. Trivial
- $n=2$: True. Proved by Poincaré, classical
- $n=3$: True. Perelman (2006) using Ricci flow + surgery
- $n=4$: True. Freedman (1982), Fields medal!
- $n=5$: True. Zeeman (1961)
- $n=6$: True. Stalling (1962)
- $n\geq 7$: True. Smale (1961) using h-cobordism theorem, uses handle decomposition + Morse functions

# Smooth Poincaré Conjecture

When is a homotopy sphere a *smooth* sphere?

- $n=1$: True. Trivial
- $n=2$: True. Proved by Poincaré, classical
- $n=3$: True.  (Top = PL = Smooth)
- $n=4$: **Open**
- $n=5$: Zeeman (1961)
- $n=6$: Stalling (1962)
- $n\geq 7$: False in general (Milnor and Kervaire, 1963), Exotic $S^n$, 28 smooth structures on $S^7$
  
**Remarks**:

- It is unknown whether or not $\BB^4 $ admits an exotic smooth structure. If not, the smooth 4-dimensional Poincaré conjecture would have an affirmative answer. 

- Current line of attack: [[Gluck twists]] on on $S^4$. 
  	Yield homeomorphic spheres, *suspected* not to be diffeomorphic, but no known invariants can distinguish smooth structures on $S^4$.

- Historic note: Morse wanted to know not the diffeomorphism type of $M$, but rather the homotopy type.

- Definition: critical values and critical points

- Definition: indices of critical points

- Definition:

- Theorem (Smale, [[h-cobordism]])
  - If $X^n$ is a smooth [[cobordism]], $n\geq 6$, $\pi_1(X) = 0$, and $X$ "looks like" a product in algebraic topology, then $X$ is a product cobordism.

- Corollary (High-Dimensional [Poincare Conjecture](../Poincare%20Conjecture.md))
  - If $X_1^n, X_2^n \cong_{\diff} S^n$, then there exists an $h\dash$cobordism between them.
  - Proof: use algebraic topology to eliminate (cancel) critical points.

- Definition: Morse function and index
  - Look at coordinate-free def?
  - Standard form at critical points
  - Alternatively: Hessian is non-singular at every critical point.
  - $f\inv\bd Y) = \bd X$

- Definition: Stable and generic

- Definition: cobordism
  - Example: (pair of pants)
  - Category: Objects are manifolds, morphisms are cobordisms between them

- Theorem: Every compact manifold has a Morse function.

- Theorem: [Morse functions](Morse%20function) are generic (given any smooth function $f: X\to Y$, there's an arbitrarily small perturbation of $f$ that is Morse).

- Theorem (Morse Lemma): If $p\in \RR^n$ is a critical point of $f: \RR^n \to \RR$ such that the Hessian $H_f(p)$ is a non-degenerate bilinear form, then $f$ is locally Morse (standard form).

  - Moreover, after diagonalizing $H_f$, the index is given by the difference in the numbers of positive/negatives on the diagonal.

- Theorem: If $(W; M_0, M_1) \to I$ is Morse with no critical points then $W \cong_{\Diff} I \cross M_0$

  - Consequence: $M_0 \cong_{\text{Diff}} M_1$ is a diffeomorphism, useful to show two things are diffeomorphic, used in higher-dimensional Poincare.

  - Recall that this is proved by constructing a vector field $V$ on $W$, then using a diffeo $\phi:I \cross M_0 \to W$ by flowing along $V$.

  - Say something about gradient flow in the case of a Riemannian metric?

[Gradient Descent](https://youtu.be/vWFjqgb-ylQ?t=5)

- **Theorem**: If $X$ is closed and admits a Morse function with exactly 2 critical points, $X$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$.
  - Possibly used in Milnor's exotic 7-sphere (show a diffeomorphism invariant differs but admits such a Morse function)

- Diffeomorphism type depends on isotopy classes of attaching maps.

Morse theory: handles nice singularities. Can have worse ones, covered by *catastrophe theory* (dynamical systems).

Fact: $M$ is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex with one cell of dimension $k$ for each critical point of $f$ of index $k$.

Index: number of linearly independent direction you can move for which the function *decreases*.

Importance of CW complexes: triangulations of surfaces.

Morse Lemma: nondegenerate critical points have standard forms $\sum \pm x_i^2$, so the index is well-defined.

Morse Theorem 1:
If there are no critical points, $M_A \homotopic M_B$.

> Lazard proved that it has a very simple structure: it is just a polynomial ring (over the integers) on generators of degree 1, 2, 3, ... (where $c_{i,j}$ has degree $(i + j − 1)$). Quillen (1969) proved that the coefficient ring of [[complex cobordism]] is naturally isomorphic as a graded ring to Lazard's universal ring.

# Motivation

In 1956, Milnor found a curious example of a manifold. He was studying sphere [bundles](../Bundle.md) over spheres, and found that there was a bundle of the form $S^3\to X\to S^4$, and that $X$ is homeomorphic to $S^7$, but it is not diffeomorphic to $S^7$. In other words, there exist exotic smooth structures on manifolds

When does there exist a manifold of [Kervaire invariant 1](Kervaire%20invariant%201.md)? The punchline is that this problem was eventually resolved (up to one case in dimension 126) and the two biggest steps (including the final step) used heavy, heavy stable homotopical machinery. For example, Browder reduced the problem to deciding whether certain elements in the [[Adams spectral sequence]] were permanent cycles,  and this was the method of attack in the [[Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel]] approach to resolve all cases except dimension 126.

# Setup

- Define $bP_{n+1} \leq \Theta_n$ the subgroup of spheres that bound [[parallelizable]] manifolds. 
- The Kervaire invariant is an invariant of a [[framed]] manifold that measures whether the manifold could be surgically converted into a sphere. 
	- 0 if true, 1 otherwise.
- [Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel](Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel):  
	- It equals 0 for $n \geq 254$.
	- Kervaire invariant = 1 only in 2, 6, 14, 30, 62. 
	- **Open case**: 126. 
- **Punchline**: there is a map $\Theta_n/bP_{n+1} \to \pi_n^S/ J$, (to be defined) and the Kervaire invariant influences the size of $bP_{n+1}$. 
	- This reduces the differential topology problem of classifying smooth structures to (essentially) computing homotopy groups of spheres.

- **Open question**: is there a manifold of dimension 126 with Kervaire invariant 1?

# Integration Workshop Notes

# Background and Terminology

To cover if less than 50% of attendees haven't taken both courses in complex analysis (UCSD 120A/B). Assumptions: Students know some real single variable calculus and vector calculus, and basic complex arithmetic (polar form, complex modulus, etc).

## Some Definitions:

- The complex plane

  - Visualize as the vector space $\RR^2$ via the injection $(x,y) \mapsto x + iy$, but there are a variety of other complex structures around (complex multiplication, conjugation, the derivative, etc). Many techniques from vector calculus in the plane will still carry over.

- Contour

  - A smooth curve in the plane (or many concatenated together). Recall from vector calculus that curves admit parameterizations, so we can write a curve as $\gamma(t): \RR \to \CC$. A *closed* contour is any contour which begins and ends at a single point, enclosing some region of the plane.

- Complex Differentiation

  - Works about the same way you'd expect from real calculus.

- Complex Integral

  - Basic idea: defined like a line/path integral in vector calculus, we use a parameterization of the contour to reduce it to a real integral. If $\gamma$ is supported on the real interval $[a, b]$ then we let
    $$
    \int_\gamma f(z)~dz = \int_a^b f(\gamma(t)) \gamma'(t) ~dt
    $$
    This is the first and most basic way to compute such an integral.
    Alternatively, if $f: \RR \to \CC$ can be written as a function of a real variable $t$ over an interval $[a,b]$, then it can be split into real imaginary parts and we can define
    $$
    \int_a^b f(t) ~dt = \int_a^b u(t) + iv(t) ~dt= \int_a^b u(t)~dt + i\int_a^b v(t) ~dt
    $$
    

- Complex Antiderivative

  - Defined like a potential function in vector calculus, a function $\phi: \CC \to \CC$ is an antiderivative of $f$ if and only if for all paths $\gamma$ from $z_a$ to $z_b$, we have
    $$
    \int_\gamma f(z) ~dz = \phi(z_b) - \phi(z_a) \text{ or equivalently for all closed contours, } \oint f(z) ~dz = 0
    $$

  - Note - a fundamental theorem of Calculus holds in $\CC$ (much like in $\RR$), but the problem is that many basic functions fail to have antiderivatives!

    - Example: $f(z) = \frac 1 z$ does not have the antiderivative $\ln z$ as in real calculus - in fact, it has no antiderivative because there is a closed contour for which $\oint f(z) \neq 0$, namely the unit circle.
    - So the workhorses from real calculus ($u$ subs, integration by parts, etc) become far less effective.

- Singularity

  - Broadly speaking, a point where the function goes to $\infty$ or fails to be defined. The prototypical example is the point $z=0$ for $f(z) = \frac{1}{z}$, or more generally $z=a$ for $f(z) = \frac{1}{z-a}$
  - We'll primarily be concerned with *poles*, which are relatively mild. These are singularities that can be "multiplied out", i.e. one can find an $n$ such that $a$ is a singularity of $f$, but $z_0$ is not a singularity of $g(z) = (z-z_0)^n f(z)$. 
    - A prototypical example is $f(z) = \frac{1}{z^2}$ at $z=0$, where $g(z) = z^2 f(z) = 1$ is no longer singular at zero.

- Holomorphic

  - Defined in open sets/neighborhoods $U$ of points. Actual definition: $f$ is complex differentiable, but in $\CC$ this is equivalent to *analytic*, i.e. has a convergent power series in only positive powers. Generally means $f$ does not have singularities in $U$. 
  - E.g. A pole is a singularity such that there exists an $n$ where $g(z)=(z-z_0)^nf(z)$ is holomorphic at $z_0$.
  - Most theorems are stated in terms of holomorphic functions.

- Residue

  - For a complex function $f$ at a point $z_0$, one can compute a Laurent expansion of $f$ at $z_0$ (expand in a power series using powers of $z, z^{-1}$). The residue of $f$ at $z_0$ is then the coefficient of $z^{-1}$ in this expansion.

  

## Conventions

$\gamma$ will denote a single contour (draw) while $\Gamma$ will denote a contour, potentially comprised of many smaller contours $\gamma_i$. The symbol $\int_\Gamma$ is complex integration along the contour $\Gamma$, while $\oint_\Gamma$ denotes integration along $\Gamma$ when $\Gamma$ is a closed contour (although $\Gamma$ may be suppressed when the contour is understood from context).

# Computing Real Integrals Using Complex Analysis

- Goal: compute something like
  $$
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)~dx \text{ or just } \int_0^\infty f(x) ~dx
  $$

- Summary of approach:

  - Use the fact that $\RR \hookrightarrow \CC$ as the real line via $x \mapsto x+0i$, so this is equivalent to a contour integral along $L_R = \{ x + 0i \mid -R \leq x \leq R\}$and we’re equivalently computing the integral 
    $$
    \int_{L_R} f(z) ~dz
    $$

  - Note that we have implicitly identified the original $f: \RR \to \RR$ with a *new* $f: \CC \to \CC$ which is given by the same formula. It may be the case that the first $f$ was well-behaved, but the new $f$ has complex singularities - in fact, we are counting on it!

  - General line/path integrals are not much easier to compute, but complex integrals around *closed contours* are. So pick a closed contour that includes $L_R$ - in this case, we’ll take half-circle of radius $R$ in the upper half plane, $C_R$:

![1545857433852](/home/zack/SparkleShare/github.com/Notes/assets/circular_contour.png)

Taking this clockwise, we'll write it as $\Gamma_R = L_R + C_R$ Note: this is not the only contour that works! 

  - We can then write
    $$
    \oint_{\Gamma_R} f(z) ~dz = \int_{L_R} f(z)~dz + \int_{C_R}f(z)~dz
    $$
    which can of course be rearranged to isolate the quantity we want:
    $$
    \int_{L_R} f(z)~dz = \oint_{\Gamma_R} f(z) ~dz - \int_{C_R}f(z)~dz
    $$

  - We can then take the limit as $R$ goes to infinity to obtain the final expression:
    $$
    \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) dx = \lim_{R \to \infty} \left( \oint_{\Gamma_R} f(z) ~dz - \int_{C_R}f(z)~dz \right)
    $$

- How to solve:

  - For the first term, we apply the residue theorem or Cauchy's integral formula (will explain momentarily)
  - For the second term, we hope that the integral along this $C_R$ is easier to compute than the integral along $L_R$ (rare), or that the integral along $C_R$ vanishes in the limit (common!)
    - For the latter case, we'll need to prove that a limit goes to zero, so we'll need some bounds/inequalities

## The Tools We'll Need:

- The triangle inequalities:
  $$
  \begin{align*}
  \left\lvert x+y\right\rvert &\leq \left\lvert x\right\rvert + \left\lvert y\right\rvert \\
  \left\lvert x-y \right\rvert &\geq \left\lvert {\left\lvert x\right\rvert - \left\lvert y \right\rvert} \right\rvert
  \end{align*}
  $$

- For any contour $\Gamma = \sum_{i=1}^n \gamma_i = \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 + \cdots + \gamma_n$, we have
  $$
  \int_\Gamma f(z)~dz = \sum_{i=1}^n \int _{\gamma_i} f(z)~dz
  $$

  - Corollary: If (say) $\gamma_1 = -\gamma_2$ , so that two components of the contour traverse the same curve in opposite directions, $\int_{\gamma_1} f(z) ~dz = -\int_{\gamma_2} f(z) ~dz$ and their contributions cancel.
  - Related fact: if there is a *homotopy* between two contours $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ that does not pass through any singularities of $f$, then $\int_{\gamma_1} f(z)~dz= \int_{\gamma_2} f(z)~dz$
  - Big conclusion: integration about any contour $\Gamma$ can be broken up into a sum of integrals around circles enclosing the singularities of $f$.

- **The Residue Theorem**:
  $$
  \oint f(z) ~dz = 2\pi i \sum_{z_i \in S_f} \mathrm{Res}(f, z_i)
  $$
  ​	  where $S_f$ is the set of poles of $f$ and $\mathrm{Res}(f, z_i)$ is the residue of $f$ at $z_i$.
    - Used as an alternative to Cauchy's Integral Formula, many ways to compute the residues on the right-hand side e.g. just expand Laurent series about $z_i$, or:

  - **The Residue Computation Workhorse:**
    Supposing that $f(z)$ can be written as a rational function $f(z)= \frac{p(z)}{q(z)}$ , where $z_0$ is a simple pole (so that $p(z_0) \neq 0$ but $q(z_0) = 0$) and the following expression makes sense , we have
    $$
    \mathrm{Res}(f, z_0) = \frac{p(z_0)}{q'(z_0)}
    $$

    

- The estimation lemma:
  $$
    \left\lvert \int_\Gamma f(z) ~dz\right\rvert \leq \left\vert \Gamma\right\vert \sup_{z\in\Gamma}\left\lvert f(z)\right\rvert
  $$
  where the first term is the length of the curve $\Gamma$ and the second is the maximum value $f$ takes on points along $\Gamma$.

- **Cauchy’s Integral Formula**: 
  For simplicity, assume $f$ is holomorphic in a neighborhood of $z_0$ (theorem: and thus smooth), then
  $$
  \oint \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{n}} ~dz = \frac {2\pi i}{(n-1)!} f^{(n-1)}(z_0)
  $$
  In particular, if $z_0$ is a pole of order 1, this reduces to
  $$
  \oint \frac{f(z)}{z-z_0} = 2\pi i f(z_0)
  $$
  

  - The trick: only need to know how to compute a contour integral on a circle around a single pole $z_0$ of order $n$, thus want to compute some $\oint g(z)$. So just rewrite $g(z) = \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^n}$ (i.e. ‘extract’ the nonsingular part for the numerator) and apply this theorem.

# Example 1: A Reciprocal of a Polynomial

Suppose we want to compute the following integral:
$$
I = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{x^6+1} ~dx
$$
We'll use the semicircle contour $\Gamma_R = L_R + C_R$ from above. Letting $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^6+1}$ and thus $f(z) = \frac{1}{z^6+1}$, we then know that
$$
\begin{equation}\tag{2}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{x^6+1} dx = \lim_{R \to \infty} \left( \oint_{\Gamma_R} \frac{1}{z^6+1} ~dz - \int_{C_R} \frac{1}{z^6+1} ~dz \right)
\end{equation}
$$
Keep this equation in mind! We will come back to it.

First, to make sure this technique will go through as desired, we'll want to make sure (and show!) that the integral around $C_R$ goes to zero in the limit. This means we'll need two quantities -- the length of $C_R$, and the supremum of $f(z)$ along it.

By design, we've chosen $C_R$ to be easy to work with -- in particular, the arc length will just be half of the circumference. Since the latter is $2\pi R$, the former is just $\pi R$.

To compute the supremum, note that we can write any point on $C_R$ as $z=Re^{i\theta}$ where $\theta \in [0, \pi]$, and so $\left\lvert z\right\rvert = \left\lvert R e^{i\theta}\right\rvert = \left\lvert {R}\right\rvert \left\lvert e^{i\theta} \right\rvert = \left\lvert R \right\rvert$, since $e^{i\theta}$ is just a point on the unit circle and thus has modulus 1. We can then conclude that
$$
\left\lvert z^6+1 \right\rvert \geq \left\lvert {\left\lvert z^6\right\rvert - \left\lvert 1 \right\rvert}\right\rvert = \left\lvert R^6 - 1\right\rvert
$$
using the reverse triangle inequality. Taking reciprocals reverses the inequality, yielding the upper bound
$$
\left\lvert \frac{1}{z^6+1} \right\rvert \leq \left\lvert \frac{1}{R^6-1}\right\rvert
$$
where applying the estimation lemma and taking the limit yields
$$
\left\lvert \int_{C_R} \frac{1}{z^6+1}~dz \right\rvert  \leq \left\lvert \frac{\pi R}{R^6-1}\right\rvert \to 0
$$
Thus for $R$ large enough, the contribution the integral along the semicircular portion of the contour will vanish. It now only remains to compute the first term, the integral around the entire closed contour.

We first need examine the singularities that $\Gamma_R$ encloses. This amounts to looking at where $\frac{1}{z^6+1}$ blows up, which are exactly the points $z^6 = -1$, or the complex sixth roots of -1. We can generate one easily as $e^{\frac{i\pi}{6}}$ since $e^{i\pi} = -1$, and generate new ones by adding angle multiples of $2k\pi$. This yields 6 unique points $\zeta_k = e^{i(\frac \pi 6 + \frac {2k\pi} 6)} = e^{\frac{i\pi}{6}(2k+1)}$ where $k$ ranges from $0$ to $5$. 

Taking $R > 1$, three of these will fall inside the contour, as shown here:

![1545866865661](/home/zack/SparkleShare/github.com/Notes/assets/example1_contour_with_singularities.png)

We can now proceed in one of two ways, both of which will involve a computation at each $\zeta_k$:

- The Residue Theorem - compute Laurent expansions and look at coefficients of $z^{-1}$ (tricky in general, usually involves some clever manipulations of series)
- Cauchy's Integral Formula - take derivatives (formulaic)

Before proceeding, note that we can factor and write $\frac{1}{z^6+1} = \frac{1}{\prod_k (z-\zeta_k)}$. Moreover, we can then juggle terms  to isolate any given root in the denominator and for any $j$ write
$$
\frac{1}{z^6+1} = \frac{\prod_{k\neq j} \frac{1}{(z-\zeta_k)}}{z-\zeta_j}
$$

For example, $\frac{1}{x^2-4} = \frac{1}{(x-2)(x-(-2))} = \frac{1/(x-2)}{x+2} = \frac{1/(x+2)}{x-2}$.

## Approach 1: Direct Residue Computation

This is rarely the method one would actually use in practice, but it's perhaps worth detailing it here. By definition, the residue of $f$ at $z_i$ is the coefficient of $\frac{1}{z-z_i}$ in the Laurent expansion of $f$  at $z=z_i$. In principal, this can always be done for rational functions, primarily using the known geometric series $\frac{1}{1-z} = 1 + z + z^2 + \cdots =  \sum_{k=1}^\infty z^k$. 

In this case, we can use partial fractions to expand $\frac{1}{z^6 + 1}$ - this is a messy but straightforward computation.[^partial_fraction] 

 This can be done by hand, but for our purposes, we'll use SAGE  to get the decomposition relatively quickly:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{z^6+1} &= \frac{e^{\frac{11 i\pi}{6}}}{6 \left(z- e^{\frac{5 i\pi}{6}} \right)} + \frac{e^{\frac{7 i\pi}{6}}}{6 \left(z- e^{\frac{i \pi}{6}}\right)} + \frac{e^{\frac{5 i\pi}{6}}}{6 \left(z- e^{\frac{11 i\pi}{6}}\right)} \\ 
\\ 
&+ \frac{e^{\frac{i \pi}{6}}}{6 \left(z- e^{\frac{7 i\pi}{6}} \right)} + \frac{e^{\frac{3 i\pi}{2}}}{6 \left(z- e^{\frac{i \pi}{2}} \right)} + \frac{e^{\frac{i \pi}{2}}}{6 \left(z- e^{\frac{3i \pi}{2}}\right)}
\end{align}
$$
(See the referenced notebook to get an idea of how this can be computed.)

To make things slightly cleaner, if we label the roots clockwise as $\zeta_i, i=0,1,\cdots 5$, this can be rewritten as 
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{z^6 + 1} &= \frac{1}{6} \left(  \frac{\zeta_5}{z-\zeta_2} + \frac{\zeta_3}{z-\zeta_0} + \frac{\zeta_2}{z-\zeta_5} 
+ \frac{\zeta_0}{z-\zeta_3} + \frac{\zeta_4}{z-\zeta_1}  + \frac{\zeta_1}{z-\zeta_4} \right)
\end{align*}
$$


These are all of the form $\frac{a}{b(z-\zeta)}$, which can manipulated into a form resembling a geometric series. The following computation shows how this is most commonly done:
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{a}{z-\zeta_i} &= a \left( \frac{1}{z-\zeta_i} \right)  \\ 
&= a \left( \frac{1/\zeta_i}{\frac{z}{\zeta_i}-1}\right) \\
&= \frac{a}{\zeta_i} \left( \frac{1}{\frac{z}{\zeta_i}-1}\right) \\
&= -\frac{a}{\zeta_i} \left( \frac{1}{1 - \frac{z}{\zeta_i} }\right) \\
&= -\frac{a}{\zeta_i} \left( 1 + \frac{z}{\zeta_i} + (\frac{z}{\zeta_i})^2 + (\frac{z}{\zeta_i})^3 + \cdots\right)
\end{align*}
$$
So if we fix one $\zeta_k$ and wish to compute the Laurent expansion about that point, we find that all 5 other terms can be expanded in this way - but most importantly, none of these 5 will contribute a term of the form $\frac{1}{z-\zeta_k}$. We thus compute $\mathrm{Res}(f, \zeta_k)$ by picking the numerator off of the term with $\zeta_k$ in the denominator (and multiplying by $\frac 1 6$) which yields
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Res}(f, \zeta_0) &= \frac 1 6 \zeta_3 \\
\mathrm{Res}(f, \zeta_1) &= \frac 1 6 \zeta_4 \\
\mathrm{Res}(f, \zeta_2) &= \frac 1 6 \zeta_5 \\
\end{align*}
$$
Applying the Residue Theorem, we have
$$
\begin{align*}
\oint_{\Gamma_R} \frac{1}{z^6+1} ~dz 
&= 2\pi i\sum_{k=0}^2 \mathrm{Res}(f, \zeta_k) \\
&= \mathrm{Res}(f, \zeta_0) + \mathrm{Res}(f, \zeta_1) + \mathrm{Res}(f, \zeta_2) \\
&= \frac{1}{6} \left( \zeta_3 + \zeta_4 + \zeta_5 \right) \\
&= -\frac{1}{6} \left( \zeta_0 + \zeta_1 + \zeta_2 \right) \\
&= -\frac{1}{6} \left( \zeta_0 + \zeta_1 - \bar{\zeta_0} \right)
\end{align*}
$$

We can readily identify $\zeta_1 = e^{i\pi/2} = i$ and use the identity $z-\bar{z} = 2i~\mathrm{Im}(z)$ and the fact that 
$$
\zeta_0 = e^{i\pi /6} = \cos(\pi/6) + i\sin(\pi/6) = \frac{\sqrt 3}{2} + \frac{1}{2}i
$$
to obtain $\zeta_0 + \bar{\zeta_0} = 2i(\frac{1}{2}) = i$. We then find that 
$$
-\frac{1}{6} \left( \zeta_0 + \zeta_1 - \bar{\zeta_0} \right) = -\frac 1 6 (i + i) = -\frac{1}{3}i
$$
and thus
$$
\oint_{\Gamma_R} \frac{1}{z^6+1} ~dz = 2\pi i(-\frac 1 3 i) = \frac{2\pi} 3
$$
Since this does not depend on $R$, taking the limit in equation $(\ref{main})$ yields this as our solution.



## Approach 2: Nice Theorems

Noting that the prior approach is slightly onerous, we can instead apply some slick theorems to simplify computing residues.

In particular, applying the **residue workhorse** and taking $p(z) = 1,~ q(z) = z^6+1$, we can compute $q'(z) = 6z^5$ and find that
$$
\mathrm{Res}(f, \zeta_k) = \frac{1}{6\zeta_k^5} = \frac{1}{6}\zeta_k^{-5}
$$
and thus
$$
\begin{align*}
\oint_{\Gamma_R} \frac{1}{z^6+1} ~dz &= \oint_{\Gamma_R} \frac{1}{z^6+1} ~dz \\
&= 2\pi i\sum_{k=0}^2 \mathrm{Res}(f, \zeta_k)  \\
&=2\pi i \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \left( \zeta_0^{-5} + \zeta_1^{-5} + \zeta_2^{-5} \right)
\end{align*}
$$
At this point, I find it most convenient to approach this geometrically by looking at how certain maps act on the shape spanned by the 6 roots (a hexagon in this case). 

Since $\left\vert \zeta_k \right\rvert = 1$ we can observe that $\zeta_k ^{-1} = \bar{\zeta_k} = \zeta_{6-k}$, which is a reflection about the real axis; one can also check that $f(z) = z^5$ is a reflection across the imaginary axis and $f(z) = -z$ is a reflection through the origin . This allows one to rewrite
$$
\begin{align*}
\oint_{\Gamma_R} \frac{1}{z^6+1} ~dz  
&= \frac{1}{6} \left( \zeta_0^{-5} + \zeta_1^{-5} + \zeta_2^{-5} \right) \\ 
&= \frac{1}{6} \left( \zeta_5^{5} + \zeta_4^{5} + \zeta_3^{5} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{6} \left( \zeta_3 + \zeta_4 + \zeta_5 \right)
\end{align*}
$$

which is precisely what we obtained with the first approach.

## Approach 3: Cauchy's Integral Formula

Finally, we can use the fact that the full contour integral can be broken into a sum of integrals around the enclosed singularities. Recalling that these are $\zeta_0, \zeta_1, \zeta_2$ 
$$
\oint_{\Gamma_R} f(z) ~dz = \oint_{\gamma_0} f(z) ~dz + \oint_{\gamma_1} f(z) ~dz + \oint_{\gamma_2} f(z) ~dz
$$
where each $\gamma_i$ is a small circle around $\zeta_i$. Now we note that if $\gamma_i$ is small enough, the only singularity it encloses is $\zeta_i$ which is just a pole of order 1 (because each root has multiplicity one), and so the function $(z-\zeta_i)^1f(z)$ is holomorphic in this region and we can apply this theorem. (Note we don't have to compute any derivatives here exactly because the poles are only first order. )

For any fixed $\zeta_k$, we use the 'trick' of writing
$$
\frac{1}{z^6 + 1} = \frac{1}{\prod_{i=1}^6 (z - \zeta_i)} = \frac{ 1 / \prod_{i\neq k} (z-\zeta_i)}{(z-\zeta_k)^1}
$$
which allows us to directly write
$$
\oint_{\gamma_k} f(z)~dz = \prod_{i\neq k}\frac{1}{ (\zeta_k - \zeta_i)}
$$
These computations are again slightly onerous but straightforward, and we obtain
$$
\begin{align*}

\oint_{\gamma_1} f(z) ~dz = \frac{1}{(\zeta_1-\zeta_0)} \frac{1}{(\zeta_1-\zeta_2)} \frac{1}{(\zeta_1-\zeta_3)} \frac{1}{(\zeta_1-\zeta_4)} \frac{1}{(\zeta_1-\zeta_5)} = \frac 1 6 \zeta_4 \\
\oint_{\gamma_2} f(z) ~dz = \frac{1}{(\zeta_2-\zeta_0} \frac{1}{(\zeta_2-\zeta_1)} \frac{1}{(\zeta_2-\zeta_3)} \frac{1}{(\zeta_2-\zeta_4)} \frac{1}{(\zeta_2-\zeta_5)} = \frac 1 6 \zeta_5 \\
\end{align*}
$$
and thus
$$
\oint_{\Gamma_R} f(z) ~dz  = \frac{1}{6}(\zeta_3 + \zeta_4 + \zeta_5)
$$
which is precisely what we obtained by the previous two methods.

## The Takeaway

In all cases, we end up reducing the hard (or sometimes impossible) problem of computing a real integral using calculus in $\RR$ to what are essentially algebra problems in $\CC$, primarily the manipulation of polynomials and roots of unity. Although these techniques may seem quite involved at first glance, a bit of practice makes them fast enough to rival the standard set of single variable real calculus techniques.

# Example 2: Integrals Containing Trig Functions

This technique is useful whenever one is trying to integrate functions of the form
$$
\int_a^b f(\cos(\omega_1 \theta), \sin(\omega_2 \theta)) ~d\theta
$$
where $a,b, \omega_1, \omega_2$ are constants. Example integrands might be things like $1+\sin(2\theta), \sin\theta + 4\cos(\pi \theta),$ or $\frac{13+\sin\theta}{5 + \cos^2\theta }$. While these may be amenable to the usual trigonometric substitutions from real calculus, but an alternative technique is to use a substitution to transform the integrands into polynomials in a complex variable $z$, and the real integral into a contour integral. From there, one can simply apply residue theorem or use any of the above techniques to compute it.





[^partial_fraction]: It is also worth noting that one could take $\frac{1}{x^6+1}$, factor the denominator, and break this into a product of 6 fractions. One can then proceed to expand each in a power series, and begin collecting terms to find the desired coefficients.

# Motivation

[Infinite loop spaces](Infinite%20loop%20space.md): When a space has the structure of a group we get extra structure on its homology groups, namely a product structure (called the [[Pontryagin product]]). In fact, we only need a weak notion of group: an [zettelkasten/H-space](zettelkasten/H-space.md) will do, i.e. a group up to homotopy

It turns out we get [homology operations](zettelkasten/Cohomology%20operations.md) if our space is associative 'up to [[coherent homotopy]].' You might ask what this means, and it turns out that it's equivalent to being the [[loop space]] of some other space. Being associative and commutative 'up to [[coherent homotopy]]'' buys you something more: you're an [Infinite loop space](Infinite%20loop%20space.md).

GUESS: 
$$
HG \da \left[ K(G, 1), K(G, 2),\, \cdots \right]
$$

then $H^n(X; G) \cong [X, K(G, 1)]$, and we can similarly extract $H^*(X; G)$ from (roughly) $\pi_* HG \definedas [\mathbb{S}, HG \bigwedge X]$????? 

> Can't be right.

# Motivation

Hopf famously discovered an essential (i.e. non-nullhomotopic) map $S^3\to S^2$, which you can think of as the being defined via $S^3\to \CP^1$ and then choosing an identification of $\CP^1$ with the sphere. The [[mapping cone]] of this map is a CW-complex and asking whether or not the map $S^3\to S^2$ is non-nullhomotopic is equivalent to asking whether or not this mapping cone is homotopy equivalent to a wedge $S^4\vee S^2$. We can see that it is not since the mapping cone is actually just $\CP^2$ and the cup square of the generator in $H^2$ is the generator in $H^4$. More generally, given a map $S^{2n−1}\to S^n$ we can form the 2-cell complex given by gluing $\DD^{2n}$ along this map and ask if the cup square of the generator in degree $H^n$ squares to the generator in degree $2n$. If it does we say this map has [[Hopf invariant one]], otherwise it has Hopf invariant 0. It's natural to ask **how many maps of Hopf invariant one can we build**? The answer is: not many. They only exist when $n=1,2,4,8$. While nowadays we usually learn the proof of this fact using [[K-theory]], which is very short.

# Homotopy Theory and the Hopf Fibration

## Introduction
- Who am I?
- Explain ties to undergraduate research


## Algebraic Topology
- Homeomorphisms and classification
	- Partition of $\mathbf{Top}$ into homeomorphism types
- Measure holes in spaces
- Why it's interesting to study
	- Understanding + classification
	- Some practical applications
		- Topological data anaylsis - given an incomplete sample, can we determine holes in the data set? (i.e. where data is not generated)
		- Sensor networks - find holes in covered regions
- The method of algebraic invariants



## Homotopy Theory
- What is a homotopy
- Homotopy equivalence of spaces
	- Partition of $\mathbf{Top}$ into homotopy types
- Weak equivalences
- Homotopy category
	- Obtained by 'localizing' at weak equivalences
	- Categorical version, recover module localization by localizing at multiplication maps

# Fibrations
- Use in homotopy theory (algebraic side)
	- The homotopy lifting property + uniqueness
		- Allows pushing homotopies upstairs
		- Use: covering space theory
	- Every map can be replaced by a fibration
		- $X \to_f Y$ factors through $M_f = X \times I \cup_f Y$ via a homotopy equivalence
			- See diagram for $M_f$, can also interpret it as the pullback of the endpoint map on $Y$, i.e. $Y^I \to Y, \gamma \mapsto \gamma(1)$.
	- Fibrations induce LES in homotopy
	- Modern categorical work:
		- Follows late work of Grothendieck (~1990)
		- Model categories, defined by weak equivalences and (co)fibrations
		- Generalizes both homotopy theory and homological algebra
		- Derived and $(\infty, n)$ categories for small  $n$ (See Jacob Lurie's work)
		- Homotopy hypothesis, a categorical equivalence between $\mathbf{Top}$ and $\infty\mathbf{Groupoid}$
- Use on the geometric side: Fiber Bundles
	- Fibration, but drop uniqueness and add local triviality
		- Locally a product: see cylinder vs mobius strip
	- Most immediately useful applications: vector bundles. Most canonical example: tangent bundle on a manifold
		- Tangent space at a point: think of circle in $\mathbb{R}^3$ now, a tangent vector at a point is somewhere on a line. Rotate up for a cylinder
		- More generally: a plane touching a blob
		- Allows doing calculus: if $f: M \to N$ is a $C^1$ function, then one can define the derivative as $DF: TM \to TN$
	- Interlude on why Manifolds are important (more than just theoretically)
		- Random sampling: can suppose that the underlying dimension has a manifold structure
		- Nonlinear fitting: instead of fitting to a line or projecting to nearby planes, fit to an arbitrary smooth shape
		- Dimensionality reduction: replace PCA, Linear Discriminant Analysis, etc with projections onto a low dimensional manifold
		- Currently making it's way into machine learning, see [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/manifold.html)
		- 3D printing: every object needs to be a manifold!
	- Classifying bundles: another way to distinguish spaces
		- Classifications turn up in homology - see $\mathbb{Z}_2$ in relation to $\RR \to M \to S^1$
		- Continues spirit of Klein's Erlangeng program - classify geometries by associated automorphism groups
	- A section of a vector bundle is just a vector field - classifying sections yields number of independent vector fields
		- Yields results like the hairy ball theorem: there is no non-vanishing tangent vector field on $S^2$
	- Also yields a method of studying connections on bundles (important in physics)

## The Hopf Fibration
- $S^1 \to S^3 \to S^2$
	- A family of circles, parameterized by a sphere
	- The hopf map is $S^3 \to S^2$, and the preimage of a point on $S^2$ is circles
	- A nontrivial bundle, i.e. $S^3 \neq S^1 \times S^2$ (different homotopy groups)
- Stereographic projection
	- See image/diagram
- How do you get the map?
	- Identify $\mathbb{R}^4 = \mathbb{C}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3 = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{C}$ and cook up a map $(z_1, z_2) \mapsto (z_3, r)$
	- Then check all points in image have norm 1, so are on $S^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$
	- Then check preimage of a point, find any two points in preimage are related by a phase, so are on a circle
- Visualization: [Hopf Fibration Tool/Tutorial](http://philogb.github.io/page/hopf/)
	- Explain that this is stereographic projection from $S^3$ to $\mathbb{R}^3$
- Visualization: [Hopf Shader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MstfDs)
	- Explain inner torus
		- Move a point around $S^2$ and look at all of the preimage circles - generates an intertwined torus (after projection)
	- Explain larger space-filling foliations
		- Move points away from center of $S^2$
- Not nullhomotopic!
- Can suspend to yield generators of stable homotopy groups, important for studying cobordism

## Interesting Results
- $\pi_3(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}$
	- Huge surprise! Mathematicians did not expect any nontrivial higher homotopy groups
	- ![asdsa](figures/homotopyGroupsStabilize.png)
	- Compute using spectral sequence $F \to E \to B$ a fibration results in
	  $$E_2^{p,q} = H^p(B, H^q(F; G)) = H^p(B;G) \tensor H^q(F; G)$$
		- ![asdas](figures/838f4c41e48b25a7bed35abc7e7d950e_1.svg)
- $\pi_4(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}_2$
- $\pi_{\geq 3} S^3 = \pi_{\geq 3} S^2$

# History

Poincaré, *Analysis Situs* papers in 1895. 
Coined "homeomorphism", defined homology, gave rigorous definition of homotopy, established "method of invariants" and essentially kicked off algebraic topology.

# Motivation
[Smooth structures](Smooth%20structures)

# Background
See Algtop homotopy notes.

## Application
If $X$ a simply connected, closed 3-manifold is a homology sphere, then it is a homotopy sphere. 

- $H_0 X = \ZZ$ since $X$ is path-connected
- $H_1 X = 0$ since $X$ is simply-connected
- $H_3 X = \ZZ$ since $X$ is orientable
- $H_2 X = H^1 X$ by **Poincaré duality**. What group is this?
  - $0 \rightarrow \operatorname{Ext}_{\ZZ}^{1}\left(H_{0}(X ; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}\right) \rightarrow H^{1}(X ; \mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}\left(H_{1}(X ; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}\right) \rightarrow 0$ yields
  - $0 \rightarrow \operatorname{Ext}_{\ZZ}^{1}\left(\ZZ, \mathbb{Z}\right) \rightarrow H^{1}(X ; \mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}\left(0, \mathbb{Z}\right) \rightarrow 0$
  - Then $\operatorname{Ext}_{\ZZ}^{1}\left(\ZZ, \mathbb{Z}\right) = 0$ because $\ZZ$ is a projective $\ZZ\dash$module, so $H^1 X = 0$.
- So $H_*(X) = [\ZZ, 0, 0, \ZZ, 0, \cdots ]$
- So $h_3: \pi_3 X \to H_3 X$ is an isomorphism by **Hurewicz**. Pick some $f\in \pi_3 X \cong \ZZ$. By partial application, this induces an isomorphism $H_* S^3 \to H_* X$.
- Taking **CW approximations** for $S^3, X$, we find that $f$ is a homotopy equivalence.

# Other Topics

Noting that $\Sigma S^n = S^{n+1}$, we could alternatively define $\mathbb{S} \definedas \lim_k \Sigma^k S^0$, then it turns out that $\pi_n \mathbb{S} = \pi_n^S$. 

This object is a *spectrum*, which vaguely resembles a chain complex with a differential:
$$
X_0 \mapsvia{\Sigma} X_2 \mapsvia{\Sigma} X_3 \mapsvia{\Sigma} \cdots
$$

Spectra *represent* invariant theories (like cohomology) in a precise way. For example, 
$$
HG \definedas \left(K(G, 1) \mapsvia{\Sigma} K(G, 2) \mapsvia{\Sigma} \cdots \right)
$$

then $H^n(X; G) \cong [X, K(G, 1)]$, and we can similarly extract $H^*(X; G)$ from (roughly) $\pi_* HG \definedas [\mathbb{S}, HG \bigwedge X]$.

> Note: this glosses over some important details! Also, smash product basically just looks like the tensor product in the category of spectra.

A modern direction is cooking up spectra that represent *extraordinary* cohomology theories. There are [[Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms]] that uniquely characterize homology on spaces.

# Continuity
What is continuity? Stirring coffee, crumpling paper, anything not involving cutting or gluing.

If points are nearby in the target, they must have come from nearby points in the source.

![Visual indication of continuity](figures/TopologicalFixedPointTheorems-fa1fa.png)

In topology, we think of spaces as being made of some soft, pliable substance like clay, and so continuous transformations are analogous to bending, stretching, and reshaping clay without tearing it apart or sticking two portions together.

Note that this is weaker than something like diffeomorphism, where we would want to do this in a differentiable way - i.e. not introduce places where a tangent plane couldn't be defined. So in topology, we can identify something like the surface of a sphere and the surface of a cube (which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic).

(As a motivation for this kind of definition, I often think of things like Gauss's Law in electromagnetism - if you only want to detect whether there is a source or a sink in some region of space, you enclose it in _some_ shape, where the actual details of the surrounding shape don't matter as much.)

![Here's an example of something halfway between a sphere and a cube](figures/TopologicalFixedPointTheorems-045d7.png)



![Spheres and Discs](figures/TopologicalFixedPointTheorems-55c1f.png)

# Fixed Points

Why does repeatedly hitting cosine converge? Because $\cos: [0, 1] \to [0, 1]$ can be identified as $\cos: D^0 \to D^0$. Can also be identified using the following graph:

```python {cmd=true, matplotlib=true}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

t1 = np.arange(0.0, 1.0, 0.05)
plt.plot(t1, np.cos(t1), 'b', label="$f(x)=\cos(x)$")
plt.plot(t1, t1, 'r', label="$f(x)=x$")
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc=2, borderaxespad=0.)
plt.show()
```


Note that "fixed point problems" are in bijective correspondence with "finding the zero of a function" problems - for example, a fixed point satisfies $f(x) = x$, but this can equivalently be stated as looking for the zeros of the function $g(x) = f(x) - x$, so $g(x) = 0 \iff f(x) -x = 0 \iff x = f(x)$. So we can equivalently look for zeros on the graph of $g(x)$:

```python {cmd=true matplotlib=true}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

t1 = np.arange(0.0, 1.0, 0.05)
plt.plot(t1, np.cos(t1) - t1, 'b', label="$f(x)=\cos(x) - x$")
plt.xlim(0, 1)
plt.ylim(0, 1)
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc=2, borderaxespad=0.)
plt.show()
```
And here we see that there is at least one zero in the interval $[0,1]$, located somewhere around $0.75$.

(Aside: Feynman once joked that the entirety of physics could be modeled by $U = 0$ for some function $U$, where you just collected every equation known to man on the left-hand side and called it $U$.)


# Brouwer's Fixed Point
Take two pieces of paper, put identical cartesian coordinates on both, lay one on a table - then crumple the other one in any way, and lay it on top. Then it is technically possible to take a pen and pierce through both papers in such a way that the mark passes through the same coordinates on both.

Formally: any $f: D^2\selfmap$ has a fixed point, i.e. an $x\in D^2$ such that $f(x) = x$.

By contradiction: suppose this doesn't hold.

Fact: $\pi_1(S^1) = \ZZ$ and $\pi_1(D^2) = 0$. Then define a new function $g: D^2 \to \del D^2 = S^1$ by drawing a line from $f(x)$ through $x$ and picking the point it hits on the boundary.

![Definition of $g: D^2 \to S^1$](figures/TopologicalFixedPointTheorems-7bba3.png)

Extending to higher dimensions: look at a cup of coffee, then imagine


# Borsuk Ulam:

There exist a pair of antipodal points with same temperature and pressure. There are _infinitely_ many antipodal points with the same temperature!

What is an antipode? Given any point $A$, you can find its antipode by drawing a line through the center of the sphere - the antipode is the other spot in which this line intersects the sphere.

Idea: pick a point $A$ (say the bottom blue point in the diagram), then it has a unique antipode $B$ (say the top blue circle). Place a thermometer at both locations, then pick any path from $A$ to $B$ over the surface of the Earth - thinking of this path as something traversed over time, we can normalize so that this it is traversed between $t=0$ and $t=1$.

This gives a continuous function $\gamma: [0, 1] \to S^2$ where $\gamma(0) = A$ and $\gamma(1) = B$.

Then this induces a "mirror" path that $B$ takes, if we always place $B$ at the antipode of $A$, wherever it is along the path.

![Band of continuous stuff](figures/TopologicalFixedPointTheorems-b44b2.png)

Then consider holding a thermometer, taking readings at $A$ and $B$, and continuously taking temperatures as you traverse this path. Since $A$ ends up at where $B$ started, following this path just swaps the temperatures!

So let's look at what's happening on a temperature vs. time graph:

![Path taken by temperature changes](figures/TopologicalFixedPointTheorems-e539d.png)

Say blue is the path taken by $A$, and green by $B$. We know the temperatures measured by $A$ and $B$ at the start of their trip, and that the temperatures must have swapped by the end. We also know that the temperature varies on $A$'s journey looks something like the blue line - so this means the two lines have to cross at _some_ point in this interval!

This is an intuitive argument, but can be made rigorous by looking at a function like
$$f: [0, 1] \to \RR \\ t\mapsto  T_1(\gamma(t)) - T_0(\gamma(t))$$.

(All this means is that we evaluate the temperature at every physical point along the path.)

Without loss of generality, $T_1(\gamma(0)) > T_2(\gamma(0))$, so $f(0) > 0$. But because these switch by the end, we must have $T_1(\gamma(1)) < T_0(\gamma(1))$, and so $f(1) < 0$. Since $f$ is continuous, we can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to conclude that $f(t) = 0$ for some $t\ in [0,1]$.

But this works for _any_ path, which means there must be a band homeomorphic to $S^1$, which is mirrored antipodally, for which the antipodal temperatures are equal. This is the red curved line in the first figure. This is the set of points for which there is an anitpodal point of the same temperature. Note that this set must be a connected band - if it were not, you could find one path avoiding all of those points, yielding a path with no equal antipodal temperatures, contradicting our earlier findings.

So we can apply this argument again with some other real measurement - say pressure, to find two antipodal points on this $S^1$ that have the same value.


# Applications

- Banach fixed point theorem - used to show existence and uniqueness of certain ODEs by applying an integral operator to functions in $C^1(\RR)$, which contracts this space and yields a fixed point.

# Major Questions:
  - What is Topology?
  - What is a fixed point?

# What is a fixed point?
  - Algebraically, for a given $A \selfmap_f$, defined by $F = \theset{x: f(x) = x}$.
    - That is, you plug in a number, you get the same number out. Think of $A = [0, 1]$ or $\RR$.
  - Geometrically, several equivalent ways to think about it\
    - Draw graph of $f$ in the plane, then find an $x$ such that $f(x) = x$: this is exactly the intersection of the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=x$.

    Draw $f(x) = \cos(x)$
    ![](figures/TopologicalFixedPointTheoremsOutline-301a4.png)
    - Equivalently, draw graph of $g(x) \definedas f(x) - x$ and find a zero.
    Draw $g(x) = \cos(x) - x$:
    ![](figures/TopologicalFixedPointTheoremsOutline-49008.png)

    - Okay, but what about $\RR^n \selfmap_f$? Now we need a different model, think of this as a _deformation_ of the space:
    ![Deformation](figures/TopologicalFixedPointTheoremsOutline-bdd5e.png)
    Imagine a movie from right pic to left - a fixed point remains stationary!
## Examples
(People can guess, show algebraically solving $f(x) = x$)

- Dumb example: $\RR \mapsvia{x \mapsto x} \RR \implies F = \RR$
- Equally dumb example: $\RR \mapsvia{x \mapsto c} \RR \implies F = \theset{c}$
- Less dumb example: $\RR \mapsvia{x \mapsto x^2} \implies F = \theset{0}$
- Less dumb example: $\RR \mapsvia{x \mapsto ax}\RR \implies F = \theset{0}$

  Show dilation of grid
- Less dumb example: $\RR \mapsvia{x \mapsto ax + b}\RR \implies F = \emptyset$ (as long as $b\neq 0$)

  How do we know there are no fixed points? Show dilation and translation of grid
  ![Affine Transformation](figures/TopologicalFixedPointTheoremsOutline-616d1.png)

- Moderate example: $\RR^2 \mapsvia{(x,y) \mapsto (y, x)} \implies F = \theset{y=x}$
Just swapping coordinates, look at a few:
![](figures/TopologicalFixedPointTheoremsOutline-081c0.png)

  This is a reflection through the line $y=x$.

- Nontrivial example: $\RR^2 \mapsvia{A} \RR^2$ where $$A = \begin{bmatrix}0 & -1\\1 & 0\end{bmatrix}$$

  (Spoiler: $F = \theset{0}$, this is a counter-clockwise rotation by $\pi/2$)

- Key example: $\RR \mapsvia{x \mapsto \cos(x)} \RR \implies F = \theset{0.739085\cdots}$.
- Moral: Fixed points can be non-obvious!

Why are fixed points important?

- Essentially any problem that asks for an $x$ such that the equation $f(x) = 0$ holds can be equivalently stated as a fixed point of some different equation $g(x) = x$
  - Example: $f(x) = x^4 - x - 10$ goes to $g(x) = 10/(x^3 - 1)$ (move 10, divide $x$) or $(x+10)^{1/4}$ (move $x-10$, take root)
- The core of a huge swatch of numerical approximation techniques: Zeros of polynomials, ODEs, PDEs, Eigenvalues, etc.
- Important theoretically - finite group theory, lie groups, topology where groups "act" on a space, etc. Used as a concrete numerical computation, maps without *any* fixed point are kind of special (like rotations).

# Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem

Every continuous function $D^n \to D^n$ has a fixed point.
(Generally, compact convex subset of $\RR^n$)



## Examples
- Crumpled pieces of paper with grid $D^2 \to D^2$
- Map on a table $D^2 \to D^2$
- Stir drink $D^3 \to D^3$

## Proof

Construct $g$,

![Definition of $g: D^2 \to S^1$](figures/TopologicalFixedPointTheorems-7bba3.png)

This fixes $\del D^2$. Then

$$ S^1 \injects^\iota D^2 \surjects^g S^1$$

induces

$$ \pi_1(S^1) \mapsvia{i_*} \pi_1(D^2) \mapsvia{f} \pi_1(S^1)\\
= \ZZ \to 0 \to \ZZ$$

Then $f\circ \iota =\id_{S^1}$, but $\iota_*$ is the zero map, so this can't induce an isomorphism - contradiction.

# Borsuk Ulask:

There exist a pair of antipodal points with same temperature and pressure. There are _infinitely_ many antipodal points with the same temperature!

What is an antipode? Given any point $A$, you can find its antipode by drawing a line through the center of the sphere - the antipode is the other spot in which this line intersects the sphere.

Then this induces a "mirror" path that $B$ takes, if we always place $B$ at the antipode of $A$, wherever it is along the path.

Then consider holding a thermometer, taking readings at $A$ and $B$, and continuously taking temperatures as you traverse this path. Since $A$ ends up at where $B$ started, following this path just swaps the temperatures!

(All this means is that we evaluate the temperature at every physical point along the path.)

Without loss of generality, $T_1(\gamma(0)) > T_2(\gamma(0))$, so $f(0) > 0$. But because these switch by the end, we must have $T_1(\gamma(1)) < T_0(\gamma(1))$, and so $f(1) < 0$. Since $f$ is continuous, we can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to conclude that $f(t) = 0$ for some $t\ in [0,1]$.

But this works for _any_ path, which means there must be a band homeomorphic to $S^1$, which is mirrored antipodally, for which the antipodal temperatures are equal.

# Motivation

The basic result is [Brown Representability](Brown%20Representability). If I have some graded homotopy invariant of spaces that takes [cofiber sequences](zettelkasten/cofiber%20sequence.md) to long exact sequences and has a suspension isomorphism and takes wedges to products, then this is represented by a sequence of spaces $\ts{E_n}$ with weak equivalences $E_n \cong \Omega E_{n+1}$ coming from the existence of the suspension isomorphism and the Yoneda lemma. 

Conversely, given a sequence of spaces $\ts{E_n}$ with maps $\Sigma E_n\to E_{n+1}$, you can cook up a [cohomolology theory](cohomolology%20theory.md). This means that one can do some pretty formal manipulations inside the category of [[Spectra]] and produce lots of different cohomology theories, even ones that have no geometric interpretation a priori.

For example, there is a cohomology theory called [tmf](Topological%20modular%20forms.md) which has (as of now) no geometric interpretation, but can detect many nontrivial maps between spheres, and can even be used to prove results in [[number theory]].

We see that self maps $E\to E$ of a spectrum give natural transformations of the corresponding [cohomolology theory](cohomolology%20theory.md). Any map of spaces has to preserve this transformation (by definition of natural), and so we can cook up [cohomology operations](zettelkasten/Cohomology%20operations.md) by cooking up maps of spectra. There's even a machine, [[Adams spectral sequence]], which computes all maps between spectra.

You can take the homotopy groups of a cohomology theory.

# Unsorted

Flipping roles, generalized cohomology theories can be studied in their own right. They come from a category called the stable homotopy category (which is much like a [[derived category]] of chain complexes), and each of them can be determined by a certain amount of data involving cohomology operations. Much of this data can be recovered by looking at how the generalized cohomology theory behaves on certain spaces (projective spaces and [[classifying spaces]] being the canonical examples).

After a lot of hard work (with some of the bigger names including Adams, Milnor, and Quillen, though I am leaving a lot of important names out) it is discovered, starting from almost pure calculation, that the stable homotopy category has a connection to the category of 1-dimensional [Formal group](../Formal%20group.md), via the study of [Characteristic classes](../Characteristic%20class.md). Each generalized cohomology theory determines some amount of formal group data.

Via things like BP-theory and the [Adams-Novikov spectral sequence](Adams-Novikov%20spectral%20sequence), leads to better qualitative understanding of the stable homotopy category, new guesses about what phenomena can occur, e.g. [the Ravenel conjectures](Ravenel%20conjecture), new techniques which are computationally useful, and new theorems (e.g. the solution of most of the Ravenel conjectures).

Form the set $\Omega_n^O$ of [[cobordism]] classes of $n\dash$manifolds.

The $O$ denotes that fact that any bundle over a manifold $M$ admits a Riemannian metric, so embedding $M$ into $\RR^\infty$ yields a [[normal bundle]] whose [structure group can be reduced](Reduction%20of%20structure%20group.md) to $O(N)$ for some $N$.

Define addition as disjoint union and multiplication by the Cartesian product to form a graded ring $\Omega^O$, and it turns out that there is a spectrum $\MO$ such that
$$
\Omega^O_n \cong_{\Grp} \pi_n MO
$$

Idea: any manifold is determined by its embedding into $\RR^\infty$, take the normal bundle $\nu$, form the [[Thom space]] $M^\nu$ by collapsing the complement of the normal bundle. 
This yields a map $S^{?} \to M^\nu$.
Now use the fact that $\nu$ is an $N\dash$dimensional bundle and is classified by a map $M \to BO(N)$, the classifying space for $O(N)\dash$bundles with universal bundle $\gamma_N$,. We take Thom spaces (?) to get a map $M^\nu \to BO(N)^{\gamma_N}$, then take
$$
\lim_{N\to \infty} [S^{N+n}, BO(N)^{\gamma_N}]_{\text{unstable?}}
$$
This is independent of the embedding and only depends on the cobordism class of $M$, so we define $MO(n) \definedas BO(N)^{\gamma_N}$.

# Motivation

Suppose you're studying manifolds. The first question you might ask is: can I find a list of all manifolds up to [[diffeomorphism]]? The answer is no. So you weaken to [[homeomorphism]], and the answer is still no. So you weaken to [[homotopy equivalence]] and the answer is still pretty much no (though you're getting better), so finally you demand a really weak notion: [[Cobordism]].

There is a sequence of spaces, $\MO(n)$, and maps $\Sigma \MO(n)\to \MO(n+1)$ such that the $k$th stable homotopy groups of this spectrum are isomorphic to the [[cobordism group]] of $k$-manifolds under disjoint union.  If you require your manifolds to be [stably framed](stable%20framing.md) you get the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]].

# Paper on Chow Rings

- Reference: a recent result, [Chow Rings computed in 2005 for $BGL_n, BSL_n, BSp_n, BO_n, BSO_n$](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0505560.pdf)

Cohomology for classifying spaces of linear algebraic groups (equivalently compact Lie Groups) have an algebraic analog: Chow rings of the classifying spaces. For a finite abelian group, the chow ring is the symmetric algebra on the group of characters.

There is a map from the Chow ring back into cohomology, which in general fails surjectivity and injectivity. Tensoring this map with $\QQ$ creates an isomorphism, though. In this case, both have the ring structure of invariants under the Weyl group in the symmetric algebra of the ring of characters of a maximal torus. (Classical result, Leray and Borel.)

Chow rings have not been computed for $PGL_n$. Need to know about Chern classes, Euler classes,

$A_*$ known for all $O_n$ and $SO_n$ for $n$ odd in 80s, general result for $SO_n$ 2004. $PGL_n$ case is much harder. Understood for $n=2$, since $PGL_2 \cong SO_3$. Other bits that have been computed: $H^*(BPGL_3, \ZZ_3), H^*(BPGL_n, \ZZ_2)$ for $n = 2 \mod 4$ in 70s/80s, incomplete results for $H^*(BPGL_p, \ZZ_p)$ in 2003.

- Setting for [Mirror Symmetry](Mirror%20Symmetry.md): the symplectic geometry of a Calabi-Yau is "the same" as the complex geometry of its mirror.

- Applications: Physicists want to study $G_2$ manifolds (an exceptional Lie group, automorphisms of octonions), part of $M\dash$theory uniting several [superstring theories](Superstring%20theory.md), but no smooth or complex structures. 
  - Indirect approach: compactify an 11-dimension space, one small $S^1$ dimension to 10 dimensions, 
    - 4 from a spacetime and 6 from a "small" Calabi-Yau

  - Dimension 2: 1 type, [$K3$ surfaces](K3%20Surface)
  - Dimension 3: (threefolds) conjectured to be a bounded number, but unknown.
    At least 473,800,776!

- [[Universal bundle]]

- Some types:

	- $\MU$
	- $K(\MU)$?
	- $K(\MO)$?
	- $\TC(\MU)$?
	- $\BP$

[Exceptional divisor](Exceptional%20divisor)

 
 - There is a theorem of Blakers and Massey, sometimes called [[homotopy excision]] which says the following:
	 - Even though taking homotopy groups does not take [cofiber sequences](cofiber%20sequence.md) to long exact sequences, it does do so in a certain range depending on the connectivity of the [cofiber sequences](cofiber%20sequence.md). 

		In particular, if we keep suspending the [cofiber sequences](cofiber%20sequence.md)  (in which case we're asking about stable homotopy groups) then this is the case. 

	Think about every time you make an argument in homology using the [[long exact sequence of a pair]], you can now make that argument with stable homotopy groups, or any other nice spectrum, etc.

- Relates $\EE^i(X)$ a cohomology theory to $H^i_\sing$:

From Arun:

> Atiyah and Hirzebruch is good but quite telegraphic, and the AHSS just ... isn't discussed in McCleary's book 
> Maunder, "The spectral sequence of an extraordinary cohomology theory" might be one such reference; for example, it shows the first nonzero differential is a [[k-invariant]]
> k-invariants are often written very confusingly; for example, for KU, Atiyah-Hirzebruch write $\Sq_3$, which you're supposed to know means reduce mod 2, do $\Sq^2$, then take the integral [[Bockstein]]

# Generating Functions


## Varieties 

Fix $q$ a prime and $\FF_q$ the (unique) finite field with $q$ elements, along with its (unique) degree $n$ extensions 
$$
\FF_{q^n} = \theset{x\in \bar \FF_q \suchthat x^{q^n} - x = 0} \quad \forall~ n\in \ZZ^{\geq 1}
$$ 

Definition (Projective Algebraic Varieties)
:  Let $J = \gens{f_1, \cdots, f_M} \normal k[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$
    be an ideal, then a *projective algebraic* variety $X\subset \PP^n_\FF$ can be described as 
    $$
    X = V(J) = \theset{\vector{x} \in \PP^n_{\FF_q} \suchthat f_1(\vector x) = \cdots = f_M(\vector x) = \vector 0}
    $$
    where $J$ is generated by *homogeneous* polynomials in $n+1$ variables, i.e. there is a fixed $d = \deg f_i \in \ZZ^{\geq 1}$ such that 

    \begin{align*}
    f(\vector x) = \sum_{\substack{\vector I = (i_1, \cdots, i_n) \\ \sum_j i_j = d}} \alpha_{\vector I} \cdot x_0^{i_1}\cdots x_n^{i_n} 
    \qtext{ and } f(\lambda \cdot \vector x) = \lambda^d f(\vector x), \lambda \in \FF\units
    .\end{align*}


## Point Counts

- For a fixed variety $X$, we can consider its $\FF_q\dash$points $X(\FF_q)$.
  - Note that $\# X(\FF_q) < \infty$ is an integer
- For any $L/\FF_q$, we can also consider $X(L)$
  - For $[L: \FF_q]$ finite, $\# X(L) < \infty$ and are integers for every such $n$.
  - In particular, we can consider the finite counts $\# X(\FF_{q^n})$ for any $n\geq 2$.
- So we can consider the sequence

\small
\begin{align*}
[N_1, N_2, \cdots , N_n, \cdots ] \definedas [\# X(\FF_q), ~ \#X (\FF_{q^2}), \cdots, ~\# X(\FF_{q^n}), \cdots]
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

- Idea: associate some generating function (a formal power series) encoding the sequence, e.g. $$F(z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty N_n z^n = N_1z + N_2 z^2 + \cdots .$$

## Why Generating Functions?

For *ordinary* generating functions, the coefficients are related to the real-analytic properties of $F$:
\begin{align*}
[z^n] \cdot F(z) = [z^n]\cdot T_{F, z=0}(z) = \frac{1}{n!} \qty{\dd{}{z}}^{n} F(z) \Bigg\rvert_{z = 0} = N_n
\end{align*}

and also to the complex analytic properties:
\begin{align*}
[z^n] \cdot F(z) \definedas \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\SS^1} {F(z) \over z^{n+1}}~dz = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\SS^1} \frac{N_n}{z} ~dz = N_n
.\end{align*}

> Using the Residue theorem. The latter form is very amenable to computer calculation.

## Why Generating Functions?

- An OGF is an infinite series, which we can interpret as an analytic function $\CC\to \CC$ 

- In nice situations, we can hope for a closed-form representation.

- A useful example: by integrating a geometric series we can derive

\begin{align*}
{1 \over 1-z} 
&= \sum_{n=0}^\infty z^n  
\hspace{5em} \qty{ = 1 + z + z^2 + \cdots} \\
\implies \int {1 \over 1-z} 
&= \int \sum_{n = 0}^\infty z^n \\
&= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \int z^n \quad{for } \abs{z} <  1 \qtext{by uniform convergence} \\
&= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n+1}z^{n+1} 
\\
\implies -\log\qty{1-z} 
&= \sum_{n=1}^\infty {z^n \over n}  
\hspace{5em} \qty{= z + {z^2 \over 2} + {z^3 \over 3} + \cdots} 
.\end{align*}

## Exponential 

- For completeness, also recall that 
$$
\exp(z) \definedas \sum_{n=0}^\infty {z^n \over n!}
$$

- We can regard $\exp, \log$ as elements in the ring of formal power series $\QQ[[z]]$.

- In particular, for any $p(z) \in z\cdot \QQ[[z]]$ we can consider $\exp(p(z)), \log(1 + p(z))$

- Since $\QQ \injects \CC$, we can consider these as a complex-analytic functions, ask where they converge, etc.


# Zeta Functions

## Definition: Local Zeta Function

Problem: count points of a (smooth?) projective variety $X/\FF$ in all (finite) degree $n$ extensions of $\FF$.

Definition (Local Zeta Function)
:   The *local zeta function* of an algebraic variety $X$ is the following formal power series:

    \begin{align*}
    Z_X(z) &= \exp\qty{ \sum_{n=1}^\infty N_n {z^n \over n} } \in \QQ[[z]] \qtext{where} N_n \definedas \# X(\FF_n)
    .\end{align*}

Note that
\begin{align*}
z \qty{\dd{}{z}} \log Z_X(z) 
&= z \dd{}{z} \qty{N_1z + N_2 {z^2 \over 2} + N_3 {z^3 \over 3} + \cdots}  \\
&= z \qty{N_1 + N_2 z +  N_3 z^2 + \cdots } \hspace{5em} \text{(unif. conv.)}\\
&= N_1 z + N_2 z^2 + \cdots
= \sum_{n=1}^\infty N_n z^n 
,\end{align*}
which is an *ordinary* generating function for the sequence $(N_n)$.

# Examples

## Example: A Point

Take $X = \pt = V(\theset{f(x) = x-c})/\FF$ for $c$ a fixed element of $\FF$.
This yields a single point over $\FF$, then 
\begin{align*}
\#X(\FF_q) &\definedas N_1 = 1 \\
\#X(\FF_{q^2}) &\definedas N_2 = 1 \\
&\vdots \\
\#X(\FF_{q^n}) &\definedas N_n = 1
\end{align*}

and so 
\begin{align*}
Z_\pt(z) 
&= \exp\qty{ 1\cdot z + 1 \cdot {z^2 \over 2} + 1 \cdot {z^3 \over 3} + \cdots } = \exp\qty{\sum_{n=1}^\infty {{z}^n \over n} }  \\
&= \exp\qty{ -\log\qty{1-z} } \\
&= {1 \over 1 - z} 
.\end{align*}


> Notice: $Z$ admits a closed form **and** is a rational function.

## Example: The Affine Line

Take $X = \AA^1/\FF$ the affine line over $\FF$, then
We can write 
$$
\AA^1(\FF_{q^n}) = \theset{\vector x = [x_1] \suchthat x_1 \in \FF_{q^n}}
$$ 
as the set of one-component vectors with entries in $\FF_n$, so
\begin{align*}
X(\FF_q) &= q \\
X(\FF_{q^2}) &= q^2 \\
&\vdots \\
X(\FF_{q^n}) &= q^n
.\end{align*}

Then
\begin{align*}
Z_X(z) 
&= \exp\qty{\sum_{n=1}^\infty q^n {z^n \over n} }  \\
&= \exp\qty{\sum_{n=1}^\infty {\qty{qz}^n \over n} }  \\
&= \exp(-\log(1 - qz)) \\
&= \frac 1 {1 - qz}
.\end{align*}



## Example: Affine m-space

Take $X = \AA^m/\FF$ the affine line over $\FF$, then
We can write 
$$
\AA^m(\FF_{q^n}) = \theset{\vector x = [x_1, \cdots, x_m] \suchthat x_i \in \FF_{q^n}}
$$ 
as the set of one-component vectors with entries in $\FF_n$, so
\noindent
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
\small
\begin{align*}
X(\FF_q) &= q^m \\
X(\FF_{q^2}) &= (q^2)^m \\
&\vdots \\
X(\FF_{q^n}) &= q^{nm}
.\end{align*}
   \normalsize
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
   \centering
    \includegraphics[width = .5\linewidth]{figures/image_2020-04-23-00-21-46.png}
\captionof{figure}{$\AA^2 / \FF_3 ~(q=3, m = 2, n = 1)$}
\end{minipage}

Then
\small
\begin{align*}
Z_X(z) 
&= \exp\qty{\sum_{n=1}^\infty q^{nm} {z^n \over n} }  
= \exp\qty{\sum_{n=1}^\infty {\qty{q^m z}^n \over n} }  \\
&= \exp(-\log(1 - q^mz)) \\
&= \frac 1 {1 - q^mz}
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

## Example: Projective Line

Take $X = \PP^1/\FF$, we can still count by enumerating coordinates:
\small
\begin{align*}
\PP^1(\FF_{q^n}) 
&= \theset{[x_1: x_2] \suchthat x_1, x_2 \neq 0 \in \FF_{q^n}}/\sim  
~= \theset{[x_1: 1] \suchthat x_1 \in \FF_{q^n}} \disjoint \theset{[1: 0]}
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

Thus

\noindent
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
\small
    \begin{align*}
    X(\FF_q) &= q + 1\\
    X(\FF_{q^2}) &= q^2 + 1 \\
    &\vdots \\
    X(\FF_{q^n}) &= q^n + 1
    .\end{align*}
    \normalsize
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
   \centering
    \includegraphics[width = .5\linewidth]{figures/image_2020-04-23-00-07-42.png}
\captionof{figure}{$\PP^1 / \FF_3 ~(q=3, n = 1)$}
\end{minipage}

Thus
\small
\begin{align*}
Z_X(z) 
&= \exp\qty{\sum_{n=1}^\infty \qty{q^n + 1} {z^n \over n} }  \\
&= \exp\qty{\sum_{n=1}^\infty {q^n } {z^n \over n} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1 \cdot {z^n \over n}}\\
&= {1 \over (1-qz)(1-z)}
.\end{align*}
\normalsize


# The Weil Conjectures

##  Weil 1

(Weil 1949)

Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety of dimension $N$ over $\FF_{q}$ for $q$ a prime,  let $Z_X(z)$ be its zeta function, and define $\zeta_X(s) = Z_X(q^{-s})$. 


1. (Rationality) 

    $Z_X(z)$ is a rational function:

    \begin{align*}
    Z_X(z) &= 
    {p_1(z) \cdot p_3(z) \cdots p_{2N-1}(z) 
    \over 
    p_0(z) \cdot p_2(z) \cdots p_{2N}(z)} \in \QQ(z),\quad\text{i.e. }\quad p_i(z) \in \ZZ[z] \\ \\
    P_0(z) &= 1-z \\
    P_{2N}(z) &= 1 - q^N z \\
    P_j(z) &= \prod_{j=1}^{\beta_i} \qty{1 - a_{j, k} z} \qtext{for some reciprocal roots} a_{j, k} \in \CC
    \end{align*}
    where we've factored each $P_i$ using its reciprocal roots $a_{ij}$.

    \small
    In particular, this implies the existence of a meromorphic continuation of the associated function $\zeta_X(s)$, which a priori only converges for $\Re(s)\gg 0$.
    This also implies that for $n$ large enough, $N_n$ satisfies a linear recurrence relation.
    \normalsize

## Weil 2

2. (Functional Equation and Poincare Duality) 

    Let $\chi(X)$ be the Euler characteristic of $X$, i.e. the self-intersection number of the diagonal embedding $\Delta \injects X\cross X$; then $Z_X(z)$ satisfies the following *functional equation*:

    \begin{align*}
    Z_X\qty{1 \over q^N z} = \pm \qty{q^{N \over 2} z}^{\chi(X)} ~~Z_X(z)
    .\end{align*}

    Equivalently,
    \begin{align*}
    \zeta_X(N-s) = \pm \qty{q^{\frac N 2 - s}}^{\chi(X)} ~\zeta_X(s)
    .\end{align*}

    > \small Note that when $N=1$, e.g. for a curve, this relates $\zeta_X(s)$ to $\zeta_X(1-s)$.\normalsize
  
    Equivalently, there is an involutive map on the (reciprocal) roots 
    \begin{align*}
    z &\iff {q^N \over z} \\
    \alpha_{j, k} &\iff \alpha_{2N-j, k}
    \end{align*}
    which sends interchanges the coefficients in $p_j$ and $p_{2N-j}$.

## Weil 3

3. (Riemann Hypothesis)

    The reciprocal roots $\alpha_{j,k}$ are *algebraic* integers (roots of some monic $p\in \ZZ[x]$) which satisfy 
    \begin{align*}
    \abs{\alpha_{j,k}}_\CC = q^{j \over 2},  \quad\quad 1 \leq j \leq 2N-1,~ \forall k
    .\end{align*}
  


4. (Betti Numbers)
  
    If $X$ is a "good reduction mod $q$" of a nonsingular projective variety $\tilde X$ in characteristic zero, then the $\beta_i = \deg p_i(z)$ are the Betti numbers of the topological space $\tilde X(\CC)$.

Moral: 

- The Diophantine properties of a variety's zeta function are governed by its (algebraic) topology.
- Conversely, the analytic properties of encode a lot of geometric/topological/algebraic information.

## Why is (3) called the "Riemann Hypothesis"?

Recall the Riemann zeta function is given by
\begin{align*}
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = \prod_{p\text{ prime}} {1 \over 1 - p^{-s}}
.\end{align*}

After modifying $\zeta$ to make it symmetric about $\Re(s) = \frac 1 2$ and eliminate the trivial zeros to obtain $\hat \zeta(s)$, there are three relevant properties

1. "Rationality": $\hat \zeta(s)$ has a meromorphic continuation to $\CC$ with simple poles at $s=0, 1$. 
2. "Functional equation": $\hat \zeta(1-s) = \hat \zeta(s)$
3. "Riemann Hypothesis": The only zeros of $\hat \zeta$ have $\Re(s) = \frac 1 2$.


## Why is (3) called the "Riemann Hypothesis"?

Suppose it holds for some $X$. Use the facts:

a. $\abs{\exp\qty{z}} = \exp\qty{\Re(z)}$ and 
b. $a^z \definedas \exp\qty{z ~\Log(a)}$,

and to replace the polynomials $P_j$ with 
\begin{align*}
L_j(s) \definedas P_j(q^{-s}) = \prod_{k=1}^{\beta_j} \qty{1 - \alpha_{j, k} q^{-s}}
.\end{align*}


## Analogy to Riemann Hypothesis

Now consider the roots of $L_j(s)$: we have
\small
\begin{align*}
L_j(s_0) = 0 
\iff (1 - \alpha_{j, k} q^{-s}) &= 0 \qtext{for some} k\\
\iff q^{-s_0} &= {1 \over \alpha_{j, k}} \\
\iff \abs{q^{-s_0}} &= \abs{1 \over \alpha_{j, k}} \quad\quad \stackrel{\text{\tiny by assumption}}{=} q^{ -{j \over 2}} \\ \\
\iff q^{-\frac j 2} \stackrel{(a)}= \exp\qty{- \frac j 2  \cdot \Log(q)} &= \abs{ \exp\qty{-s_0 \cdot \Log(q)} } \\
&\stackrel{(b)}= \abs{ \exp\qty{-\qty{\Re(s_0) + i\cdot \Im(s_0)} \cdot \Log(q)} }  \\
&\stackrel{(a)}= \exp\qty{-\qty{\Re(s_0)} \cdot \Log(q)}  \\ \\
\iff - \frac j 2 \cdot \Log(q) &= -\Re(s_0) \cdot \Log(q) \qtext{by injectivity} \\
\iff \Re(s_0) = \frac j 2
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

## Analogy with Riemann Hypothesis

Roughly speaking, we can apply $\Log$ (a conformal map) to send the $\alpha_{j, k}$ to zeros of the $L_j$, this says that the zeros all must lie on the "critical lines" $\frac{j}{2}$.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 1.0\textwidth]{figures/image_2020-04-23-02-26-27.png} 
\end{figure}

In particular, the zeros of $L_1$ have real part $\frac 1 2$ (analogy: classical Riemann hypothesis).

## Precise Relation

- Difficult to find in the literature! 
- Idea: make a similar definition for schemes, then take $X = \spec \ZZ$.
- Define the "reductions mod $p$" $X_p$ for closed points $p$.
- Define the *local* zeta functions $\zeta_{X_p}(s) = Z_{X_p}(p^{-s})$.
- (Potentially incorrect) Evaluate to find $Z_{X_p}(z) = {1 \over 1 - z}$.
- Take a product over all closed points to define

\begin{align*}
L_X(s) 
&= \prod_{p\text{ prime}} \zeta_{X_p}(p^{-s}) \\
&= \prod_{p\text{ prime}} \qty{ 1 \over 1 - p^{-s}} \\
&= \zeta(s)
,\end{align*}

which is the Euler product expansion of the classical Riemann Zeta function.

# Weil for Curves

## Weil for Curves 

The Weil conjectures take on a particularly nice form for curves.
Let $X/\FF_q$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$, then

1. (Rationality) $$Z_X(z) = {p_1(z) \over p_0(z) p_2(z)} = {p_1(z) \over (1-z)(1-qz)}$$
2. (Functional Equation) $$Z_X\qty{1 \over qz} = \qty{z\sqrt q}^{2-2g} Z_X(z)$$
3. (Riemann Hypothesis) $$p_1(z) = \prod_{i=1}^{\beta_1} (1 - a_iz ) \qtext{where} \abs{a_i} = \sqrt{q}$$
4. (Betti Numbers) $\mcp_{\Sigma_g}(x) = 1 + 2g\cdot x + x^2 \implies \deg p_1 = \beta_1 = 2g$.


\tiny
> $\mcp$ here is the Poincaré polynomial, the generating function for the Betti numbers.
> $\Sigma_g$ is the surface (real 2-dimensional smooth manifold) of genus $g$.
\normalsize

## The Projective Line

Recall $Z_{\PP^1/\FF_q}(z) = {1 \over (1-z)(1-qz)}$.

1. Rationality: Clear!
2. Functional Equation: $g=0 \implies 2g-2 = 2$
\begin{align*}
Z_{\PP^1}\qty{{1 \over qz}}
= {1 \over (1-{1 \over qz})(1 - {q \over qz}) }  
= {qz^2 \over (1-z)(1-qz)} 
= {\qty{\sqrt q z}^2 \over (1-z)(1-qz) }
.\end{align*}

3. Riemann Hypothesis: Nothing to check (no $p_1(z)$)
4. Betti numbers: Use the fact that $\mcp_{\CP^1} = 1 + 0\cdot x + x^2$, and indeed $\deg p_0 = \deg p_2 = 1,~ \deg p_1 = 0$.

> Note that even Betti numbers show up as degrees in the denominator, odd in the numerator.
> Allows us to immediately guess the zeta function for $\PP^n/\FF_q$ by knowing $H^* \CP^\infty$!


## Elliptic Curves 

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Some Elliptic Curves}
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{figures/image_2020-04-23-02-40-31.png} 
\end{figure}

Consider $E/\FF_q$. 

- (Nontrivial!) The number of points is given by
$$
N_n \definedas E(\FF_{q^n}) = (q^n + 1) - ( \alpha^n + {\bar \alpha}^n ) \qtext{where} \abs{\alpha} = \abs{\bar \alpha} = \sqrt{q}
$$
  - **Proof**: Involves trace (or eigenvalues?) of Frobenius, (could use references)

- $\dim_\CC E/\CC = N = 1$ and $g=1$.



The Weil Conjectures say we should be able to write 
\begin{align*}
Z_E(z) = {p_1(z)  \over p_0(z) p_2(z)} = 
{p_1(z) \over (1-z) (1 - qz)} =
{ (1 - a_{1}z)(1 - a_{2}z)  \over (1-z)(1- qz)}
.\end{align*}

## Elliptic Curves: Weil 1

1. Rationality: using the point count, we can compute 
\small
\begin{align*}

which is a rational function of the expected form (Weil 1).

## Elliptic Curves: Weil 2 and 3

2. Functional Equation: we use the equivalent formulation of "Poincaré duality": 
\begin{align*}
{(1-\alpha z)(1-\bar \alpha z) \over (1-z)(1-qz)} =  
{p_1(z) \over p_0(z) p_2(z)}  \implies 
\begin{cases}
z &\iff {q \over z} \\
\alpha_{j, k} &\iff \alpha_{2-j, k}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

This amounts to checking that the coefficients of $p_0, p_2$ are interchanged, and that the two coefficients of $p_1$ are interchanged:

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Coefs}(p_0) = \theset{1} &\mapsvia{z\to {q\over z}} \theset{1 \over q} = \mathrm{Coefs}(p_2)  \\
\mathrm{Coefs}(p_1) = \theset{\alpha, \bar \alpha} &\mapsvia{z\to {q\over z}}  \theset{{q \over \alpha}, {q \over \bar\alpha} } = \theset{\bar \alpha, \alpha} \qtext{using} \alpha\bar\alpha = q
.\end{align*}

3. RH: Assumed as part of the point count ($\abs \alpha = q^{1\over 2}$)

4. Betti Numbers: $\mcp_{\Sigma_1}(x) = 1 + 2x + x^2$, and indeed $\deg p_0 = \deg p_2 = 1,~ \deg p_1 = 2$.

# Weil for Projective m-space

## Setup 

Take $X = \PP^m/\FF$ 
We can write 
$$
\PP^m(\FF_{q^n}) = \AA^{m+1}(\FF_{q^n}) \setminus \theset{\vector 0}/\sim ~= \theset{\vector x = [x_0, \cdots, x_m] \suchthat x_i \in \FF_{q^n}}/\sim
$$

But how many points are actually in this space?

\end{figure}

> A nontrivial combinatorial problem!


## q-Analogs and Grassmannians 

To illustrate, this can be done combinatorially:
identify $\PP^m_\FF = \Gr_{\FF}(1, m+1)$ as the space of lines in $\AA^{m+1}_\FF$.

Theorem
:   The number of $k\dash$dimensional subspaces of $\AA^N_{\FF_q}$ is the $q\dash$analog of the binomial coefficient:
    \begin{align*}
    \genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{N}{k}_q \definedas \frac{(q^N - 1)(q^{N-1}-1) \cdots (q^{N - (k-1)} -  1)}{(q^k-1)(q^{k-1} - 1) \cdots (q-1)}
    .\end{align*}

> Remark: Note $\lim_{q\to 1} \genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{N}{k}_q = {N \choose k}$, the usual binomial coefficient.

**Proof:**  To choose a $k\dash$dimensional subspace, 
  
- Choose a nonzero vector $\vector v_1 \in \AA^n_\FF$ in $q^N - 1$ ways.
  - For next step, note that $\#\spanof\theset{\vector v_1} = \#\theset{\lambda \vector v_1 \suchthat \lambda \in \FF_q} = \# \FF_q = q$.
  
- Choose a nonzero vector $\vector v_2$ *not* in the span of $\vector v_1$ in $q^N - q$ ways.
  - Now note $\# \spanof\theset{\vector v_1, \vector v_2} = \# \theset{\lambda_1 \vector v_1 + \lambda_2 \vector v_2 \suchthat \lambda_i \in \FF} = q\cdot q = q^2$.

## Proof continued

- Choose a nonzero vector $\vector v_3$ *not* in the span of $\vector v_1, \vector v_2$ in $q^N -q^2$ ways.

- $\cdots$ until $\vector v_k$ is chosen in $$(q^N-1)(q^N-q) \cdots (q^N - q^{k-1}) \qtext{ways}.$$ 
  - This yields a $k\dash$tuple of linearly independent vectors spanning a $k\dash$dimensional subspace $V_k$

- This overcounts because many linearly independent sets span $V_k$,  we need to divide out by the number of ways to choose a basis inside of $V_k$.

- By the same argument, this is given by $$(q^k-1)(q^k-q) \cdots (q^k - q^{k-1})$$ 


Thus
\small
\begin{align*}
\# \text{subspaces} 
&= \frac{ (q^N-1)(q^N-q)(q^N - q^2) \cdots (q^N - q^{k-1}) }{ (q^k-1)(q^k-q)(q^k-q^2) \cdots (q^k - q^{k-1})}\\ \\
&= {q^N - 1 \over q^k - 1} \cdot \qty{q \over q} {q^{N-1} - 1 \over q^{k-1} - 1} \cdot \qty{q^2 \over q^2}{q^{N-2} - 1 \over q^{k-2} - 1} \cdots \qty{q^{k-1} \over q^{k-1}}{q^{N - (k-1)} - 1 \over q^{k - (k-1) - 1}} \\ 
&= \frac{(q^N - 1)(q^{N-1}-1) \cdots (q^{N - (k-1)} -  1)}{(q^k-1)(q^{k-1} - 1) \cdots (q-1)}
.\end{align*}
\normalsize

$\qed$

## Counting Points 

> Note that we've actually computed the number of points in any Grassmannian.

Identify $\PP^m_\FF = \Gr_{\FF}(1, m+1)$ as the space of lines in $\AA^{m+1}_\FF$.

We obtain a simplification (importantly, a *sum formula*) when setting $k=1$:
\begin{align*}
\genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{m+1 }{1}_q = {q^{m+1}-1 \over q - 1} = q^{m} + q^{m-1} + \cdots + q + 1 = \sum_{j=0}^{m} q^j
.\end{align*}

Thus
\begin{align*}
X(\FF_q) &= \sum_{j=0}^{m} q^j  \\
X(\FF_{q^2}) &= \sum_{j=0}^{m} \qty{q^2}^j  \\
&\vdots \\
X(\FF_{q^n}) &= \sum_{j=0}^{m} \qty{q^n}^j
.\end{align*}

## Computing the Zeta Function 

So
\begin{align*}
Z_X(z) 
&= \exp\qty{ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{j=0}^{m} \qty{q^n}^j {z^n \over n} } \\
&= \exp\qty{ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{j=0}^{m} {\qty{q^jz}^n \over n} } \\
&= \exp\qty{ \sum_{j=0}^{m} \sum_{n=1}^\infty {\qty{q^jz}^n \over n} } \\
&= \exp\qty{ \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} -\log(1 - q^j z) } \\
&= \prod_{j=0}^{m} \qty{1-q^jz}\inv \\
&=
\qty{1 \over 1 - z} \qty{1 \over 1 - qz} \qty{1 \over 1 - q^2 z} \cdots \qty{1 \over 1- q^m z}
,\end{align*}

> Miraculously, still a rational function! Consequence of sum formula, works in general. 

## Checking the Weil Conjectures

\begin{align*}
Z_X(z) = \prod_{j=0}^m \qty{1 \over 1 - q^j z} 
.\end{align*}

1. Rationality: Clear!

2. Functional Equation: Less clear, but true:

\begin{align*}
Z_X\left(\frac{1}{q^{m} z}\right) 
&=\frac{1}{\left(1-1 / q^{m} t\right)\left(1-q / q^{m} t\right) \cdots\left(1-q^{m} / q^{m} z\right)} \\
&=\frac{q^{m} z \cdot q^{m-1} z \ldots q z \cdot z}{(1-z)(1-q z) \ldots\left(1-q^{m} z\right)} \\
&=q^{m(m+1) \over 2} z^{m+1} \cdot Z_X(z)\\
&= \qty{q^{m\over 2}z}^{\chi(X)} \cdot Z_X(z) \\
.\end{align*}

## Checking

\begin{align*}
Z_X(z) = \prod_{j=0}^m \qty{1 \over 1 - q^j z} 
.\end{align*}

3. Riemann Hypothesis: Reduces to the statement $\theset{ \alpha_i } = \theset{{q^m \over \alpha_j }}$.
  - Clear since $\alpha_j = q^j$ and every $\alpha_i$ is a lower power of $q$.

4. Betti Numbers: Use the fact that $\mcp_{\CP^m}(x) = 1 + x^2 + x^4 + \cdots + x^{2m}$
  - Only even dimensions, and correspondingly no numerator.

## An Easier Proof: "Paving by Affines"

Quick recap:
\begin{align*}
Z_{\pt} = {1 \over 1 - z} && Z_{\PP^1}(z) = {1 \over 1 - qz} && Z_{\AA^1}(z) = {1\over (1-z)(1-qz)}
.\end{align*}

Note that $\PP^1 = \AA^1 \disjoint \theset{\infty}$ and correspondingly $Z_{\PP^1}(z) = Z_{\AA^1}(z) \cdot Z_{\pt}(z)$.
This works in general:

Lemma (Excision)
: If $Y/\FF_q \subset X/\FF_q$ is a closed subvariety, for $U = X\setminus Y$, $Z_X(z) = Z_Y(z) \cdot Z_{U}(z)$.

**Proof**:
Let $N_n = \# Y(\FF_{q^n})$ and $M_n = \# U(\FF_{q^n})$, then
\begin{align*}
\zeta_X(z) 
&= \exp\qty{\sum_{n=1}^\infty \qty{N_n + M_n} {z^n \over n} }  \\
&= \exp\qty{\sum_{n=1}^\infty N_n \cdot {z^n \over n} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty M_n \cdot {z^n \over n}}\\
&= \exp\qty{\sum_{n=1}^\infty N_n \cdot {z^n \over n}} \cdot \exp\qty{\sum_{n=1}^\infty M_n \cdot {z^n \over n}}
= \zeta_Y(z) \cdot \zeta_U(z)
.\end{align*}


## An Easier Proof: "Paving"

Note that geometry can help us here: we have a decomposition $\PP^n = \PP^{n-1} \disjoint \AA^n$, and thus inductively a stratification 
\begin{align*}
\PP^m = \disjoint_{j=0}^m \AA^j = \AA^0 \disjoint \AA^1 \disjoint \cdots \disjoint \AA^m
.\end{align*}

Recalling that 
$$
Z_{X\disjoint Y}(z) = Z_X(z) \cdot Z_Y(z)
$$

and $Z_{\AA^j}(z) = {1 \over 1 - q^j z}$, we have
\begin{align*}
Z_{\PP^m}(z) = \prod_{j=0}^m Z_{\AA^j}(z) = \prod_{j=0}^m {1 \over 1 - q^j z}
.\end{align*}


# Grassmannians 

## Motivation

Consider now $X = \Gr(k, m) / \FF$ -- by the previous computation, we know
\begin{align*}
X(\FF_{q^n}) = 
\genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{m}{k}_{q^n} \definedas \frac{(q^{nm} - 1)(q^{{nm}-1}-1) \cdots (q^{{nm} - n(k-1)} -  1)}{(q^{nk}-1)(q^{n(k-1)} - 1) \cdots (q^n-1)}
\end{align*}

but the corresponding Zeta function is much more complicated than the previous examples:
\begin{align*}
Z_X(z) &= \exp\qty{ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{m}{k}_{q^n}   {z^n \over n} } = \cdots ?
.\end{align*}

Since $\dim_\CC \Gr_\CC (k, m) = 2k(m-k)$, by Weil we should expect 
$$
Z_X(z) = \prod_{j=0}^{2k(m-k)} \frac{p_{2(j+1)}(z)}{p_{2j}(z)}
$$ 
with $\deg p_j = \beta_j$.

## Grassmannian
It turns out that (proof omitted) one can show
\begin{align*}
\genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{m}{k}_{q} = \sum_{j=0}^{k(m-k)} \lambda_{m, k}(j) q^j \implies Z_X(z) = \prod_{j=0}^{k(m-k)} \qty{ \frac{1}{ 1 - q^j x} }^{\lambda_{m, k}(j)}
\end{align*}

where $\lambda_{m, k}$ is the number of integer partitions of of $[i]$ into at most $m-k$ parts, each of size at most $k$.

- One proof idea: use combinatorial identities to write $q\dash$analog $\genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{m}{k}_{q}$ as a *sum*
- Second proof idea: "pave by affines" (need a reference!)

This lets us conclude that the Poincare polynomial of the complex Grassmannian is given by 
$$
\mcp_{\Gr_\CC(m, k)}(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{k(m-k)} \lambda_{m, k}(n) x^{2n},
$$

> In particular, the $H^* \Gr_\CC(m, k)$ vanishes in odd degree.


# Weil's Proof


## Diagonal Hypersurfaces

Proof of rationality of $Z_X(T)$ for $X$ a diagonal hypersurface.

- Set $q$ to be a prime power and consider $X/\FF_q$ defined by $$X = V(a_0x_0^{n} + \cdots + a_r x_r^{n}) \subset \FF_q^{r+1}.$$
- We want to compute $N = \# X$.
- Set $d_i = \gcd(n_i, q-1)$. 
- Define the character
  \begin{align*}
  \psi_q: \FF_q & \to \CC\units \\
  a &\mapsto \exp\qty{2\pi i ~\Tr_{\FF_q/\FF_p}(a) \over p} 
  .\end{align*}
  - By Artin's theorem for linear independence of characters, $\psi_q \not \equiv 1$ and every additive character of $\FF_q$ is of the form $a \mapsto \psi_q(ca)$ for some $c\in \FF_q$.


- Shorthand notation: say $a\sim 0 \iff a \equiv 0 \mod 1$.



## A Diagonal Hypersurface

- Fix an injective multiplicative map
\begin{align*}
\phi: \bar{\FF}_q\units \to \CC\units
.\end{align*}

- Define
\begin{align*}
\chi_{\alpha, n}: \FF_{q^n}\units &\to \CC\units \\
x & \mapsto \phi(x)^{\alpha\qty{q^n-1}} \\ \\
\quad \qtext{for} \alpha \in \QQ/\ZZ, n\in \ZZ, & \quad \alpha\qty{q^n-1} \equiv 0 \mod 1 
.\end{align*}

  - Extend this to $\FF_{q^n}$ by 
  \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}
  1 & \alpha \equiv0 \mod 1 \\
  0 & \text{else} 
  \end{cases}
  .\end{align*}
  - Set $\chi_\alpha = \chi_{\alpha, 1}$.
- Proposition: $$\alpha(q-1) \equiv 0 \mod 1 \implies \chi_{\alpha, n}(x) = \chi_\alpha(\mathrm{Nm}_{\FF_{q^n} / \FF_q }(x) )$$
- Proposition: $$d \definedas \gcd(n, q-1), u \in \FF_q \implies \#\theset {x\in \FF_q \suchthat x^n = u} = \sum_{d\alpha \sim 0} \chi_\alpha(u)$$


## A Diagonal Hypersurface

- This implies
\begin{align*}
N &= \sum_{\substack{\alpha = [\alpha_0, \cdots, \alpha_r] \\ d_i \alpha_i \sim 0}} \quad \sum_{\substack{\vector u = [u_0, \cdots ,u_r] \\ \Sigma~ a_i u_i = 0}}
\quad \prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(u_j) \\ \\ 
&= q^r + \sum_{\substack{\alpha,~ \alpha_i \in (0, 1) \\ d_i \alpha_i \sim 0}} 
\qty{ \prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(a_j \inv ) \sum_{\Sigma~ u_i=0}  \quad \prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(u_j) }
.\end{align*}
  since the inner sum is zero if some *but not all* of the $\alpha_i \sim 0$.

- Evaluate the innermost sum by restricting to $u_0 \neq 0$ and setting $u_i = u_0 v_i$ and $v_0 \definedas 1$:
\begin{align*}
\sum_{\Sigma~ u_i=0}  \quad \prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(u_j)
&=
\sum_{u_0 \neq 0} \chi_{_{\Sigma ~ \alpha_i}}(u_0) 
\sum_{\Sigma ~v_i = 0} ~\prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j} (v_j)  \\
&=
\begin{cases}
\qty{q-1} \sum_{\Sigma~ v_i = 0} ~\prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(v_j)  & \qtext{if} \sum \alpha_i \sim 0 \\
0 & \qtext{else}
\end{cases}
.\end{align*}


## A Diagonal Hypersurface

- Define the *Jacobi sum* for $\alpha$ where $\sum \alpha_i \sim 0$:
\begin{align*}
J(\alpha) \definedas  \qty {1 \over q-1} \sum_{\Sigma~ u_i = 0} ~\prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(u_j) = \sum_{\Sigma~ v_i = 0} ~\prod_{j=1}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(v_j) 
\end{align*}

- Express $N$ in terms of Jacobi sums as 
\begin{align*}
N = q^r + \qty{q-1} \sum_{\substack{\Sigma \alpha_i \sim 0 \\ d_i \alpha_i \sim 0 \\ \alpha\in (0, 1)}} \prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(a_j\inv ) J(\alpha)
.\end{align*}

- Evaluate $J(\alpha)$ using Gauss sums: for $\chi: \FF_q \to \CC$ a multiplicative character, define
\begin{align*}
G(\chi) &\definedas  \sum_{x\in \FF_q} \chi(x) \psi_q(x)
.\end{align*}

- Proposition: for any $\chi \neq \chi_0$, 
  - $\abs{G(\chi)} = q^{1 \over 2}$
  - $G(\chi) G(\bar \chi) = q \chi(-1)$
  - $G(\chi_0) = 0$
  \begin{align*}
  \chi(t) = {G(\chi) \over q} \sum_{x\in \FF_q} \bar \chi(x) \psi_q(tx) 
  .\end{align*}

## A Diagonal Hypersurface

- Proposition: if 
\begin{align*}
\sum \alpha_i \sim 0 \implies J(\alpha) = {1 \over q} \prod_{k=1}^r G(\chi_{\alpha_k}) \qtext{and} \abs{J(\alpha)} = q^{r - 1\over 2}
.\end{align*}
- We thus obtain
\begin{align*}
N = q^r + \qty{q-1 \over q} \sum_{\substack{\Sigma \alpha_i \sim 0 \\ d_i \alpha_i \sim 0 \\ \alpha\in (0, 1)}} ~\prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(a_j\inv ) G(\chi_{\alpha_j})
.\end{align*}
- We now ask for number of points in $\FF_{q^\nu}$ and consider a point count 
\begin{align*}
\bar{N}_\nu = \# \theset{[x_0: \cdots : x_r] \in \PP^r_{\FF_q^\nu} \suchthat \sum_{i=0}^r a_i x_i^n = 0}
.\end{align*}

- Theorem (Davenport, Hasse) $$\qty{q-1}\alpha \sim 0 \implies -G(\chi_{\alpha, \nu}) = \qty{-G(\chi_\alpha)}^\nu.$$

## A Diagonal Hypersurface

- We have a relation $\qty{q^\nu - 1} \bar N_\nu = N_\nu$.
- This lets us write
\begin{align*}
\bar N_\nu = \sum_{j=0}^{r-1} q^{j\nu} + \sum_{\substack{\sum \alpha_i ~\sim 0 \\ \gcd(n, q^\nu - 1)\alpha_i \sim 0 \\ \alpha_i \in (0, 1) }} 
 \prod_{j=0}^r \bar \chi_{\alpha_{j, \nu}}(a_i) J_\nu(\alpha)
.\end{align*}
- Set
\begin{align*}
\mu(\alpha) &= \min\theset{\mu \suchthat \qty{q^\mu - 1} \alpha \sim 0} \\
C(\alpha) &= (-1)^{r+1} \prod_{j=1}^r \bar \chi_{\alpha_0, \mu(\alpha)}(a_j) \cdot J_{\mu(\alpha)}(\alpha)
.\end{align*}
- Plugging into the zeta function $Z$ yields
\begin{align*}
\exp\qty{\sum_{\nu = 1}^\infty \bar N_\nu {T^\nu \over \nu} }
= \prod_{j=0}^{r-1} \qty{1 \over 1 - q^j T}
\prod_{\substack{\sum \alpha_i \sim 0 \\ \gcd(n, q^\nu - 1)\alpha_i \sim 0 \\ \alpha_i \in (0, 1) }}
\qty{1 - C(\alpha) T^{\mu(\alpha)}}^{(-1)^r \over \mu(\alpha)}
,\end{align*}
which is evidently a rational function!

## Definition of Zeta Function

Fix $q$ a prime and $\FF \definedas \FF_q$ the finite field with $q$ elements, along with its unique degree $n$ extensions 
$$
\FF_n \definedas \FF_{q^n} = \theset{x\in \bar \FF_p \suchthat x^{q^n} - x = 0} \quad \forall~ n\in \ZZ^{\geq 2}
$$ 

Definition
:  Let  
    $$
    J = \gens{f_1, \cdots, f_M} \normal k[x_0, \cdots, x_n]
    $$ 
    be an ideal, then a *projective algebraic* variety $X\subset \PP^N_\FF$ can be given by 
    $$
    X = V(J) = \theset{\vector x \in \PP^\infty_\FF \suchthat f_1(\vector x) = \cdots = f_M(\vector x) = \vector 0}
    $$ 
    where an ideal generated by *homogeneous* polynomials in $n+1$ variables, i.e. there is some fixed $d\in \ZZ^{\geq 1}$ such that 

    \begin{align*}
    f(\vector x) = \sum_{\substack{\vector I = (i_1, \cdots, i_n) \\ \sum_j i_j = d}} \alpha_{\vector I} \cdot x_0^{i_1}\cdots x_n^{i_n} 
    \qtext{ and } f(\lambda \cdot \vector x) = \lambda^d f(\vector x)
    .\end{align*}

> For the experts: we can take a reduced (possibly reducible) scheme of finite type over a field $\FF_p$.
> We will be thinking of $K\dash$valued points for $K/\FF_p$ algebraic extensions.
> From the audience: what condition do we need to put on such a scheme to guarantee an embedding into $\PP^\infty$?

Examples:

- Dimension 1: Curves
- Dimension 2: Surfaces
- Codimension 1: Hypersurfaces


Fix $X/\FF \subset \PP$ an $N\dash$dimensional projective algebraic variety, and say it's cut out by the equations $f_1, \cdots f_M \in \FF[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$.
Note that it then has points in any finite extension $L/K$.

:   Define the *local zeta function* of $X$ the following formal power series:

    \begin{align*}
    Z_X(z) &= \exp\qty{ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \alpha_n  {z^n \over n} } \in \QQ[[z]] \qtext{where} \alpha_n \definedas \# X(\FF_n)
    .\end{align*}

Concretely, for $X\subset \PP^M$ a variety cut out by $\theset{f_i} \subset \FF[x_0, \cdots, x_M]$ we are measuring the sizes of the sets
\begin{align*}
\alpha_n \definedas \# \theset{\vector x \in \PP^M_{\FF_{q^n}} \suchthat f_i(\vector x) = \vector 0 ~\forall i }
.\end{align*}


> Compare to the Poincare polynomials: $P_{\RP^m}(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^m$ and $P_{\CP^m}(x) = 1 + x^2 + \cdots + x^{2m}$

## Statement of Weil Conjectures

(Weil 1949)

Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety of dimension $N$ over $\FF_{q}$ for $q$ a prime,  let $Z_X(z)$ be its zeta function, and define $\zeta_X(s) = Z_X(q^{-s})$. 


1. (Rationality) 

    $Z_X(z)$ is a rational function:

    \begin{align*}
    Z_X(z) &= 
    {p_1(z) \cdot p_3(z) \cdots p_{2N-1}(z) 
    \over 
    p_0(z) \cdot p_2(z) \cdots p_{2N}(z)} \in \QQ(z),\quad\text{i.e. }\quad p_i(z) \in \ZZ[z] \\ \\
    P_0(z) &= 1-z \\
    P_{2N}(z) &= 1 - q^N z \\
    P_j(z) &= \prod_{j=1}^{\beta_i} \qty{1 - a_{j, k} z} \qtext{for some reciprocal roots} a_{j, k} \in \CC
    \end{align*}
    where we've factored each $P_i$ using its reciprocal roots $a_{ij}$.

    In particular, this implies the existence of a meromorphic continuation of the associated function $\zeta_X(s)$, which a priori only converges for $\Re(s)\gg 0$.
    This also implies that for $n$ large enough, $N_n$ satisfies a linear recurrence relation.

2. (Functional Equation and Poincare Duality) 

    Let $\chi(X)$ be the Euler characteristic of $X$, i.e. the self-intersection number of the diagonal embedding $\Delta \injects X\cross X$; then $Z_X(z)$ satisfies the following *functional equation*:

    \begin{align*}
    Z_X\qty{1 \over q^N z} = \pm \qty{q^{N \over 2} z}^{\chi(X)} ~~Z_X(z)
    .\end{align*}

    Equivalently,
    \begin{align*}
    \zeta_X(N-s) = \pm \qty{q^{\frac N 2 - s}}^{\chi(X)} ~\zeta_X(s) \\
    .\end{align*}

    > Note that when $N=1$, e.g. for a curve, this relates $\zeta_X(s)$ to $\zeta_X(1-s)$.
  
    Equivalently, there is an involutive map on the (reciprocal) roots 
    \begin{align*}
    z &\iff {q^N \over z} \\
    \alpha_{j, k} &\iff \alpha_{2N-j, k}
    \end{align*}
    which sends roots of $p_j$ to roots of $p_{2N-j}$.

3. (Riemann Hypothesis)

  The reciprocal roots $a_{j,k}$ are *algebraic* integers (roots of some monic $p\in \ZZ[x]$) which satisfy 
  \begin{align*}
  \abs{a_{j,k}}_\CC = q^{j \over 2}  \quad\quad \forall 1 \leq j \leq 2N-1,~ \forall k
  .\end{align*}
  


4. (Betti Numbers)
  If $X$ is a "good reduction mod $q$" of a nonsingular projective variety $\tilde X$ in characteristic zero, then the $\beta_i = \deg p_i(z)$ are the Betti numbers of the topological space $\tilde X(\CC)$.

Why is (3) called the "Riemann Hypothesis"?

We can use the facts that

a. $\abs{\exp\qty{z}} = \exp\qty{\Re(z)}$ and 
b. $a^z \definedas \exp\qty{z \Log(a)}$,

to replace the polynomials $P_i$ with 
\begin{align*}
L_j(s) \definedas \zeta_X(q^{-s}) = \prod_{k=1}^{\beta_j} \qty{1 - \alpha_{j, k} q^{-s}}
.\end{align*}

Now consider the roots of $L_j(s)$: we have
\begin{align*}
L_j(s_0) &= 0 \\
\iff q^{-s_0} &= {1 \over \alpha_{j, k}} \qtext{for some} k \\
\implies \abs{q^{-s_0}} &= \abs{1 \over \alpha_{j, k}} \quad\quad \stackrel{\text{\tiny by assumption}}{=} q^{ -{j \over 2}} \\
\implies q^{-\frac j 2} \stackrel{(a)}= \exp\qty{- \frac j 2  \cdot \Log(q)} &= \abs{ \exp\qty{-s_0 \cdot \Log(q)} } \\
&\stackrel{(b)}= \abs{ \exp\qty{-\qty{\Re(s_0) + i\cdot \Im(s_0)} \cdot \Log(q)} }  \\
&\stackrel{(a)}= \exp\qty{-\qty{\Re(s_0)} \cdot \Log(q)}  \\
\implies - \frac j 2 \cdot \Log(q) &= -\Re(s_0) \cdot \Log(q) \qtext{by injectivity} \\
\implies \Re(s_0) = \frac j 2
.\end{align*}

Roughly speaking, realizing that we would need to apply a logarithm (a conformal map) to send the $\alpha_{j, k}$ to zeros of the $L_j$, this says that the zeros all must lie on the "critical lines" $\frac{j}{2}$.

![](figures/image_2020-04-21-17-55-47.png)\

In particular, the zeros of $L_1$ have real part $\frac 1 2$, analogous to the classical Riemann hypothesis.

> Moral: the Diophantine properties of a variety's zeta function are governed by its (algebraic) topology.
> Conversely, the analytic properties of encode a lot of geometric/topological/algebraic information.
> Plug for Langland's: it similarly asks for every $L$ function arising from an automorphic representation that (essentially) satisfy Weil 2 and 3.

Historical note

- Desire for a "cohomology theory of varieties" drove 25 years of progress in AG

Remarks:

  - Resolved for varieties over $\FF_q$
- On $L_X$:
  - Conjectured for smooth varieties over $\QQ$ (rationality $\sim$ analytically continues to a meromorphic function, some functional equation), little is known.
  - Resolved for elliptic curves (Taylor-Wiles c/o the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture), implies $L_X$ is an $L$ function coming from a modular form.

### Aside: Why call it a Zeta function?

Knowing the zeta function of a point, we can now make a precise analogy.

Suppose we have an algebraic variety cut out by equations:
\begin{align*}
\AA_\ZZ^n \supseteq X = V(\gens{f_1, \cdots, f_d}) \qtext{where} f_i \in \ZZ[x_0, \cdots, x_{n-1}]
.\end{align*}

Then for every prime $q$, we can reduce the equations mod $p$ and consider 
$$
\AA_{\FF_q}^n \supseteq X_q \definedas V(\gens{f_1 \mod q, \cdots ,f_d \mod q}) \qtext{where} f_1 \mod q \in \FF_q[x_0, \cdots, x_{n-1}]
$$

Then define the *Hasse-Weil* zeta function:
\begin{align*}
L_X(s) = \prod_{p\text{ prime}} \zeta_{X_p}\qty{p^{-s}}
.\end{align*}

Take $X = \spec \QQ$ and $X_p = \spec \FF_p$, which is a single point since $\FF_p$ is a field. 
The previous example shows that
\begin{align*}
\zeta_{X_p}(z) 
= {1 \over 1-z}
,\end{align*}

We then find that
\begin{align*}
L_X(s) 
&= \prod_{p\text{ prime}} \zeta_{X_p}(p^{-s}) \\
&= \prod_{p\text{ prime}} \qty{ 1 \over 1 - p^{-s}} \\
&= \zeta(s)
,\end{align*}

which is the Euler product expansion of the classical Riemann Zeta function.

Moreover, it is a theorem (difficult, not proved here!) that for any variety $X/\FF_p$, we have
\begin{align*}
\zeta_X(t) 
= \prod_{x\in X_{\text{cl}}} \qty{1 \over 1 - t^{\deg(x)}} 
\quad \overset{t = p^{-s}}{\implies} \quad
\zeta_X(s) = \prod_{x\in X_{\text{cl}}} \qty{1 \over 1 - \qty{p^{\deg(x)}}^{-s} } 
,\end{align*}

which we can think of as attaching a "weight" to each closed point, $\abs{x} \definedas p^{\deg(x)}$, and the usual Riemann Zeta corresponds to assigning a weight of 1 to each point.

> Note that this immediately implies that $\zeta_X(t) \in \ZZ[[t]]$ is a *rational* function.

Recall the Riemann zeta function is given by
\begin{align*}
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = \prod_{p\text{ prime}} {1 \over 1 - p^{-s}}
.\end{align*}

After modifying $\zeta$ to make it symmetric about $\Re(s) = \frac 1 2$ and eliminate the trivial zeros at $-2\ZZ$ to obtain $\hat \zeta(s)$, there are three relevant properties

- "Rationality": $\hat \zeta(s)$ has a meromorphic continuation to $\CC$ with simple poles at $s=0, 1$. 
- "Functional equation": $\hat \zeta(1-s) = \hat \zeta(s)$
- "Riemann Hypothesis": The only zeros of $\hat \zeta$ have $\Re(s) = \frac 1 2$.


### More Examples


#### Example (Affine Space):

Set $X = \AA^m/\FF$, affine $m\dash$space over $\FF$, so we can just repeat with now $m$ coordinates
$$
\AA^1(\FF_n) = \theset{\vector x = [x_1, \cdots, x_m] \suchthat x_i \in \FF_n}
$$ 
Counting yields
\begin{align*}
X(\FF) &= q^m \\
X(\FF_2) &= (q^2)^m \\
&\vdots \\
X(\FF_n) &= (q^n)^m
.\end{align*}

Thus
\begin{align*}
\zeta_X(z) = \exp\qty{\sum_{n=1}^\infty {q^{nm} \over n} z^n } = \frac 1 {1 - q^m z}
.\end{align*}

#### Example (Projective Line):
$X = \PP^1/\FF$ the projective line over $\FF$, then we can write use some geometry to write
$$
\PP^1_\FF = \AA^1_\FF \disjoint \theset{\infty}
$$ 
as the affine line with a point added at infinity.

We can then count by enumerating coordinates:
\begin{align*}
\PP^1(\FF_n) 
&= \theset{[x_1, x_2] \suchthat x_1, x_2 \neq 0 \in \FF_n}/\sim  \\
&= \theset{[x_1, 1] \suchthat x_1 \in \FF_n} \disjoint \theset{[1, 0]}
.\end{align*}

Thus
\begin{align*}
X(\FF) &= q + 1\\
X(\FF_2) &= q^2 + 1 \\
&\vdots \\
X(\FF_n) &= q^n + 1\\
.\end{align*}


Thus
\begin{align*}
\zeta_X(z) = {1 \over (1-z)(1-qz)} \\ 
.\end{align*}


#### Example (Projective Space):

Take $X = \PP^n_{\FF}$, 

Example image of $\PP^2_{\GF(3)}$:
![](figures/image_2020-04-19-22-32-07.png)\

Note that we can identify $X = \Gr_{\FF}(1, n)$ as the space of lines in $\AA^n_\FF$.

Proposition
:   The number of $k\dash$dimensional subspaces of $\AA^m_\FF$ is the $q\dash$binomial coefficient:
    \begin{align*}
    \genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{m}{k}_q \definedas \frac{(q^m - 1)(q^{m-1}-1) \cdots (q^{m - (k-1)} -  1)}{(q^k-1)(q^{k-1} - 1) \cdots (q-1)}
    .\end{align*}

Proof
:   To choose a $k\dash$dimensional subspace, 
    
    - Choose a nonzero vector $\vector v_1 \in \AA^n_\FF$ in $$q^m - 1$$ ways.
      - Identify $\#\spanof\theset{\vector v_1} = \#\theset{\lambda \vector v_1 \suchthat \lambda \in \FF} = \# \FF = q$.
    - Choose a nonzero vector $\vector v_2$ *not* in the span of $\vector v_1$ in $$q^m - q$$ ways.
      - Identify $\# \spanof\theset{\vector v_1, \vector v_2} = \# \theset{\lambda_1 \vector v_1 + \lambda_2 \vector v_2 \suchthat \lambda_i \in \FF} = q\cdot q = q^2$.
    - Choose a nonzero vector $\vector v_3$ not in the span of $\vector v_1, \vector v_2$ in $$q^m -q^2$$ ways.
    - $\cdots$ until $\vector v_k$ is chosen in $$(q^m-1)(q^m-q) \cdots (q^m - q^{k-1})$$ ways. 
      - This yields a $k\dash$tuple of linearly independent vectors spanning a $k\dash$dimensional subspace $V_k$
    - This overcounts because many linearly independent sets span $V_k$,  we need to divide out by the number of choose a basis inside of $V_k$.
    - By the same argument, this is given by $$(q^k-1)(q^k-q) \cdots (q^k - q^{k-1})$$ 

    Thus
    \begin{align*}
    \# \text{subspaces} 
    &= \frac{ (q^m-1)(q^m-q)(q^m - q^2) \cdots (q^m - q^{k-1}) }{ (q^k-1)(q^k-q)(q^k-q^2) \cdots (q^k - q^{k-1})}\\
    &= {q^m - 1 \over q^k - 1} \cdot \qty{q \over q} {q^{m-1} - 1 \over q^{k-1} - 1} \cdot \qty{q^2 \over q^2}{q^{m-2} - 1 \over q^{k-2} - 1} \cdots \qty{q^{k-1} \over q^{k-1}}{q^{m - (k-1)} - 1 \over q^{k - (k-1) - 1}}
    .\end{align*}

We obtain a nice simplification for the number of lines corresponding to setting $k=1$:
\begin{align*}
\genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{m}{1}_q = {q^m-1 \over q - 1} = q^{m-1} + q^{m-2} + \cdots + q + 1 = \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} q^j
.\end{align*}

Thus
\begin{align*}
X(\FF) &= \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} q^j  \\
X(\FF_2) &= \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \qty{q^2}^j  \\
&\vdots \\
X(\FF_n) &= \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \qty{q^n}^j
.\end{align*}

So
\begin{align*}
\zeta_X(z) = \qty{1 \over 1 - z} \qty{1 \over 1 - qz} \qty{1 \over 1 - q^2 z} \cdots \qty{1 \over 1- q^m z}   \\ 
,\end{align*}



Note that geometry can help us here: we have a "cell decomposition" $\PP^n = \PP^{n-1} \disjoint \AA^n$, and so inductively
\begin{align*}
\PP^n = \AA^0 \disjoint \AA^1 \disjoint \cdots \disjoint \AA^n
,\end{align*}

and it's straightforward to prove that
$$
\zeta_{X\disjoint Y}(z) = \zeta_X(z) \cdot \zeta_Y(z)
$$

and recalling that $\zeta_{\AA^j}(z) = {1 \over 1 - q^j z}$ we have
\begin{align*}
\zeta_{\PP^m}(z) = \prod_{j=0}^m \zeta_{\AA^j}(z) = \prod_{j=0}^n {1 \over 1 - q^j z}
.\end{align*}



Example:
Take $X = \Gr_{\FF}(k, n)$, then ????? so
\begin{align*}
\zeta_X(t) = ? 
.\end{align*}


## Hard Example: An Elliptic Curve

The Weyl conjectures take on a particularly nice form for curves.
Let $X/\FF$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$, then

1. (Rationality) $$\zeta_X(z) = {p(z) \over (1-z)(1-qz)}$$
2. (Functional Equation) $$\zeta_X\qty{1 \over qz} = q^{1-g} z^{2-2g} \zeta_X(z)$$
3. (Riemann Hypothesis) $$p(t) = \prod_{i=1}^{2g} (q - a_i z) \qtext{where} \abs{a_i} = {1 \over \sqrt q}$$

Take $X = E/\FF$. 

![](figures/image_2020-04-20-23-28-45.png)\

Then
\begin{align*}
\zeta_X(t) = {(1-aq^{-t}) (1 - \bar a q^{-t}) \over (1 - q^{-t})(1 - q^{1-s}) }
.\end{align*}

The betti numbers are $[1,2,1, 0, \cdots]$.

The number of points are 
$$
X(\FF_n) = (q^n + 1) - ( \alpha^n + {\bar \alpha}^n ) \qtext{where} \abs{\alpha} = \abs{\bar \alpha} = \sqrt{q}
$$

Rough outline of proof:

- ?? 

The (complex?) dimension of $X$ is $N=1$, 
The WC say we should be able to write this as
\begin{align*}
{p_1(z)  \over p_0(z) p_2(z)} = 
{p_1(z) \over (1-z) (1 - qz)} =
{ (1 - \alpha_{1, 1}z)(1 - \alpha_{1, 2}z)  \over (1-z)(1- qz)}
.\end{align*}

Since we know the number of points, we can compute
\begin{align*}
\zeta_X(z) 
&= \exp \sum_{n=1}^\infty \#X(\FF_n) {z^n \over n} \\
&= \exp \sum_{n=1}^\infty \qty{q^n + 1 - \qty{\alpha^n + \bar\alpha^n}} {z^n \over n} \\
&=
\exp \qty{ \sum_{n=1}^\infty q^n\cdot {z^n \over n} }
\exp \qty{ \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1\cdot {z^n \over n} }
\exp \qty{ \sum_{n=1}^\infty -\alpha^n \cdot {z^n \over n} }
\exp \qty{ \sum_{n=1}^\infty -\bar\alpha^n\cdot{z^n \over n} } \\ \\
&=
\exp\qty{-\log\qty{1-qz} }
~~\exp\qty{-\log\qty{1-z} }
~~\exp\qty{\log\qty{1- \alpha z} }
~~\exp\qty{\log\qty{1 - \bar \alpha z} } \\ \\ 
&= {(1-\alpha z)(1-\bar \alpha z) \over (1-z)(1-qz)} \in \QQ(z)
,\end{align*}
which is indeed a rational function.

## Very Hard Example: A Diagonal Hypersurface

> [Reference](https://math.mit.edu/~notzeb/weil.pdf)

Proof of rationality of $Z_X(T)$ for $X$ a diagonal hypersurface.

- Set $q$ to be a prime power and consider $X/\FF_q$ defined by $$X = V(a_0x_0^{n_0} + \cdots + a_r x_r^{n_r}) \subset \FF_q^{r+1}.$$
- We want to compute $N = \# X$.
- Set $d_i = \gcd(n_i, q-1)$. 
- Define the character
  \begin{align*}
  \psi_q: \FF_q & \to \CC\units \\
  a &\mapsto \exp\qty{2\pi i ~\Tr_{\FF_q/\FF_p}(a) \over p} 
  .\end{align*}
  - By Artin's theorem for linear independence of characters, $\psi_q \not \equiv 1$ and every additive character of $\FF_q$ is of the form $a \mapsto \psi_q(ca)$ for some $c\in \FF_q$.
- Fix an injective multiplicative map
\begin{align*}
\psi: \bar{\FF}_q\units \to \CC\units
.\end{align*}
- Define
\begin{align*}
\chi_{\alpha, n}: \FF_{q^n}\units &\to \CC\units \\
x & \mapsto \phi(x)^{\alpha\qty{q^n-1}} \\ \\
\quad \qtext{for} \alpha \in \QQ/\ZZ, n\in \ZZ, & \quad \alpha\qty{q^n-1} \equiv 0 \mod 1 
.\end{align*}

  - Extend this to $\FF_{q^n}$ by 
  \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}
  1 & \alpha \equiv0 \mod 1 \\
  0 & \text{else} 
  \end{cases}
  .\end{align*}
  - Set $\chi_\alpha = \chi_{\alpha, 1}$.
- Shorthand notation: say $a\sim 0 \iff a \equiv 0 \mod 1$.
- Proposition: $$\alpha(q-1) \equiv 0 \mod 1 \implies \chi_{\alpha, n}(x) = \chi_\alpha(\mathrm{Nm}_{\FF_{q^n} / \FF_q }(x) )$$
- Proposition: $$d \definedas \gcd(n, q-1), u \in \FF_q \implies \#\theset {x\in \FF_1 \suchthat x^n = u} = \sum_{d\alpha \sim 0} \chi_\alpha(u)$$
- This implies
\begin{align*}
N &= \sum_{\substack{\alpha = [\alpha_0, \cdots, \alpha_r] \\ d_i \alpha_i \sim 0}} \quad \sum_{\substack{\vector u = [u_0, \cdots ,u_r] \\ {\textstyle{\sum}} a_i u_i = 0}}
\quad \prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(u_j) \\ \\ 
&= q^r + \sum_{\substack{\alpha,~ \alpha_i \in (0, 1) \\ d_i \alpha_i \sim 0}} 
\qty{ \prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(a_j \inv ) \sum_{\Sigma~ u_i=0}  \quad \prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(u_j) }
.\end{align*}
  since the inner sum is zero if some *but not all* of the $\alpha_i \sim 0$.

- Evaluate the innermost sum by restricting to $u_0 \neq 0$ and setting $u_i = u_0 v_i$ and $v_0 \definedas 1$:
\begin{align*}
\sum_{\Sigma~ u_i=0}  \quad \prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(u_j)
&=
\sum_{u_0 \neq 0} \chi_{_{\Sigma ~ \alpha_i}}(u_0) 
\sum_{\Sigma ~v_i = 0} ~\prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j} (v_j)  \\
&=
\begin{cases}
\qty{q-1} \sum_{\Sigma~ v_i = 0} ~\prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(v_j)  & \qtext{if} \sum \alpha_i \sim 0 \\
0 & \qtext{else}
\end{cases}
.\end{align*}
- Define the *Jacobi sum* for $\alpha$ where $\sum \alpha_i \sim 0$:
\begin{align*}
J(\alpha) \definedas  \qty {1 \over q-1} \sum_{\Sigma~ u_i = 0} ~\prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(u_j) = \sum_{\Sigma~ v_i = 0} ~\prod_{j=1}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(v_j) 
\end{align*}

- Express $N$ in terms of Jacobi sums as 
\begin{align*}
N = q^r + \qty{q-1} \sum_{\substack{\Sigma \alpha_i \sim 0 \\ d_i \alpha_i \sim 0 \\ \alpha\in (0, 1)}} \prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(a_j\inv ) J(\alpha)
.\end{align*}

- Evaluate $J(\alpha)$ using Gauss sums: for $\chi: \FF_q \to \CC$ a multiplicative character, define
\begin{align*}
G(\chi) &\definedas  \sum_{x\in \FF_q} \chi(x) \psi_q(x)
.\end{align*}

- Proposition: for any $\chi \neq \chi_0$, 
  - $\abs{G(\chi)} = q^{1 \over 2}$
  - $G(\chi) G(\bar \chi) = q \chi(-1)$
  - $G(\chi_0) = 0$
  \begin{align*}
  \chi(t) = {G(\chi) \over q} \sum_{x\in \FF_q} \bar \chi(x) \psi_q(tx) 
  .\end{align*}

- Proposition: if $\sum \alpha_i \sim 0$, then $J(\alpha) = {1 \over q} \prod_{k=1}^r G(\chi_{\alpha_k})$ and $\abs{J(\alpha)} = q^{r - 1\over 2}$.
- We thus obtain
\begin{align*}
N = q^r + \qty{q-1 \over q} \sum_{\substack{\Sigma \alpha_i \sim 0 \\ d_i \alpha_i \sim 0 \\ \alpha\in (0, 1)}} ~\prod_{j=0}^r \chi_{\alpha_j}(a_j\inv ) G(\chi_{\alpha_j})
.\end{align*}
- We now ask for number of points in $\FF_{q^\nu}$
- Theorem (Davenport, Hasse) $\qty{q-1}\alpha \sim 0 \implies -G(\chi_{\alpha, \nu}) = \qty{-G(\chi_\alpha)}^\nu$.

---

- Now restrict to $n_0 = \cdots = n_r = n$ a constant, and we consider a point count 
\begin{align*}
\bar{N}_\nu = \# \theset{[x_0: \cdots : x_r] \in \PP^r_{\FF_q^\nu} \suchthat \sum_{i=0}^r a_i x_i^n = 0}
.\end{align*}

- We have a relation $\qty{q^\nu - 1} \bar N_\nu = N_\nu$.
- This lets us write
\begin{align*}
\bar N_\nu = \sum_{j=0}^{r-1} q^{j\nu} + \sum_{\substack{\sum \alpha_i ~\sim 0 \\ \gcd(n, q^\nu - 1)\alpha_i \sim 0 \\ \alpha_i \in (0, 1) }} 
 \prod_{j=0}^r \bar \chi_{\alpha_{j, \nu}}(a_i) J_\nu(\alpha)
.\end{align*}
- Set
\begin{align*}
\mu(\alpha) &= \min\theset{\mu \suchthat \qty{q^\mu - 1} \alpha \sim 0} \\
C(\alpha) &= (-1)^{r+1} \prod_{j=1}^r \bar \chi_{\alpha_0, \mu(\alpha)}(a_j) \cdot J_{\mu(\alpha)}(\alpha)
.\end{align*}
- Plugging into the zeta function $Z$ yields
\begin{align*}
\exp\qty{\sum_{\nu = 1}^\infty \bar N_\nu {T^\nu \over \nu} }
= {1 \over (1-T) (1-qT) \cdots (1-q^{r-1}T)  } \prod_{\substack{\sum \alpha_i \sim 0 \\ \gcd(n, q^\nu - 1)\alpha_i \sim 0 \\ \alpha_i \in (0, 1) }}
\qty{1 - C(\alpha) T^{\mu(\alpha)}}^{(-1)^r \over \mu(\alpha)}
,\end{align*}
which is evidently a rational function.

About algebraic variety: defined by polynomial equations,
Hypersurfaces are defined by one equation
Let $X/K: f(x_0, \cdots, x_{n+1}) = 0, \vector x \in \PP_k^{n+2}$, so the variety will have dimension.

For any $L/K$ we can consider the $L$ points $X(L) = \vector x\in L^{n+2} / \sim$ where identify $\vector x = \lambda \vector x$ for any $\lambda \in L\units$?

Example:
$n=1$, $f(x,y,z) = y^2 z - x^3 - ax^2 z - bz^3 \in \PP^2_K$ for $K = \QQ$, where $a, b \in \ZZ$, is the homogeneous Weierstrass equation for an elliptic curve.

Example:
Taking $K = \CC$ for an arbitrary $X$ yields a complex analytic space (manifold with singularities), which is in fact a manifold when $\Jac(f_1, \cdots, f_n) \neq 0$ is nonvanishing on $X(\CC)$ (so the tangent space is full dimension everywhere).


Example:
For $K = \FF_p$, $X(\FF_p)$ is a finite set, which we can count.

We can consider extensions $F_{p^r} = \FF_p[\theset{\zeta_{p^r}}]$ given by adjoining all of the roots of $x^{p^r} - 1$.
We now obtain a sequence of numbers:
\begin{align*}
\# X(\FF_p), \# \FF_{p^2}, \cdots
.\end{align*}

Can we determine them completely (without a brute-force count)?
Can we say anything about the asymptotics?

The simplest case: $X = \AA^n$, we have $\AA^n(\FF_{p^r}) = p^{rn}$, so in generael $X(\FF_{p^r}) = p^{rn} - \text{ error terms }$.

Theorem (Weil)
: If $n=1$, so there is 1 defining equation, with $X$ smooth and connected, then $\# X(\FF_{p^r}) = p^r + O(p^{r/2})$.

We in fact know $\# X(\FF_{p^r})$ is $p^r + 1 - \sum_{i=1}^g \alpha+i^r$ where $g$ is the genus of ths curve and $\alpha_i \in \bar \QQ$ with $\abs{\iota(\alpha)}= \sqrt{2}$ for any embedding $\bar \QQ \injects \CC$ where the $\alpha_i$ are algebraic.

Note that this condition is much stronger than $\abs{\alpha_i} = \sqrt{p}$, since e.g. $1 \pm \sqrt 2$ have two different norms.

How to generalize to higher dimensions: do combinatorics!
Take a certain generating series, the zeta function:
\begin{align*}
Z(X, t) = \exp( \sum_{r=1}^\infty {t^r \over r} \# X(\FF_{p^t})) \in \QQ[[t]]
.\end{align*}

> Note that we're not using an OGF.

Example:
For $X= \PP^n$, take the hyperplane $f(\vector x) - x_{n+2} = 0$.
Then $\#X(\FF_{p^r}) = p^rn + p^{r(n-1)} + p^{r(n-2)} + \cdots + 1$ where we count the embedded $\AA^n$ in the first term, an $\AA^{n-1}$ in the hyperplane at infinity, the embedded $\AA^{n-2}$ in *its* hyperplane at infinity, etc.

Note that the sum will turn this into a product, and we get
\begin{align*}
Z(\PP^n, t) = \prod_{j=0}^n \exp(\sum_t {t^r \over r}p^{rj}) = \prod_{j=0}^n {1 \over 1 - p^jt}
.\end{align*}
which is in fact a rational function.

In general, for $X$ a curve, we obtain
\begin{align*}
Z(X, t) = {(1 - \alpha_1 t) \cdots(1 - \alpha_j t \over (1-t) (1-pt) )} 
.\end{align*}

Weil conjectures for $X$ smooth and connected of dimension $n$: 

- $Z(X, t) \in \QQ(t)$
- (RH) Explicitly, $Z(X, t) = {P_1(t) \cdots P_{2n-1}(t) \over P_0(t) \cdots P_{2n}(t)}$
  - $P_i(t) \in \ZZ[t]$, so the roots are algebraic integers. Normalize to $P_i(0) = 1$ so the constant term is 1.
  - $P_i(t) = \prod_j (1 - \alpha_{ij} t)$ (i.e. the roots), so the absolute value of every embedding is $p^{i/2}$
- (Functional equation) $Z(X, 1/p^nt) = \pm t^\chi p^{c/2} Z(X, t)$ where $c = \sum_{i=0}^{2n} (-1)^\chi \deg P_i$. Note that $\chi$ will be the Euler-Poincare characteristic.
- If $X$ comes by reduction mod $p$ from some $X'/\QQ$, then $\deg P_i = \beta_i = \dim_\QQ H^i(X(\CC); \QQ)$.

Note that the genus is half of the first betti number.

Why are they called the RH for varieties over finite fields?
Identify $\ZZ$ as the ring of functions over a curve $\spec \ZZ$.
We think of $x\in \spec \ZZ$ as a map $\ev_x: \ZZ \to \FF_p$ of rings, so points correspond to evaluating at the point.

Recall that we can write the Riemann zeta function as the Dirichlet series $\zeta(s) = \sum_n {1 \over n^s}$ and expand as an euler product $\prod_{p\text{ prime}} {1 \over 1 - p^{-s}$.

Recall that the Riemann-Zeta function has a product expansion


\begin{align*}
\zeta(s) = \sum n^{-s} = \prod_{p\in P} (1-p^{-s})\inv
\end{align*}

where the product is taken over all primes $P$.

Let $X = V(\theset{f_i})\definedas V(f)$ be the vanishing locus of a family of polynomials in $F = \FF_q[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ for some prime power $q$.

Let $N_m = \abs{\theset{ \vector x \in X(\FF_q) \suchthat f_i(\vector x) = 0 }} = \abs{V(f)} \subset F$, the number of $\FF_q$ points, or equivalently just the size of this variety.

Then the Hasse-Weil Zeta function is defined as


\begin{align*}
\zeta_X(t) = \exp{\displaystyle\sum_{m\geq 1} \frac {N_m} m  t^m}
\end{align*}

We immediately make a change of variables and send $t\to q^{-s}$ to obtain

\begin{align*}
\zeta_X(s) = \exp{\sum_{m\geq 1} \frac {N_m} m \qty{q^{-s}}^m }
.\end{align*}

> Why? Turns the zeta function into a Dirichlet series in $s$.
> Yields $\abs{t} = q^{-\Re(s)}$.
> Defined for $\abs{t} < \frac 1 q$ in $\CC$, extended to all of $\CC$ as a rational function in $x$.
> Converts "All zeros of $\zeta_X$ have absolute value $\frac{1}{\sqrt q}$" to "All zeros of $\zeta_X$ have real part $\frac 1 2$".

[Explanation of why exponential appears](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/325186/motivation-for-zeta-function-of-an-algebraic-variety)

Rough explanation: Take a bad first approximation and then correct.
Let $X$ be a fixed variety, for $p\in X$ define $\norm{p}_X = q^n$ where $n$ is the $n$ occurring in the minimal field of definition of $p$, which is $\FF_{q^n}$. 

Attempt to define
\begin{align*}
\zeta_{X, q}(s) = \prod_{p\in X} \frac{1}{1-\norm{p}_X^{-s}}
.\end{align*}

Note that $-\log(x+1) = \sum_{n\geq 1} \frac{x^n}{n}$.

Now fix one $p\in X$ and consider the factor it contributes, and take its logarithm:

\begin{align*}
\log\qty{\frac{1}{1-\norm{p}_X^{-s}}} 
&= - \log(1-\norm{p}_X^{-s}) \\
&=  - \log(-\norm{p}_X^{-s} + 1) \\
&= \sum_{j\geq 1} \frac{\norm{p}_X^{-js}}{k} \\
&= \sum_{j\geq 1} \frac{q^{-nks}}{k} \\
&= \sum_{j\geq 1} \frac{n}{nk}(q^{-s})^{nk} \\
(m=nk)\quad &= \sum_{j\geq 1} \frac{n}{m}(q^{-s})^{m}
,\end{align*}

so we see this single point contributes $n$ to $N_m$, when instead we'd like it to contribute exactly 1.

Fix:
If $p$ is minimally defined over $\FF_{q^n}$, consider its Galois orbit (taking automorphisms of $\FF_{q^n}$).
There are exactly $n$ points in the orbit of $p$ -- namely, the conjugates of $p$ -- so if we redefine

\begin{align*}
\zeta_{X, q}(s) = \prod_{\text{One } p \text{ in each Galois orbit}} \frac{1}{1-\norm{p}_{X}^{-s} }
.\end{align*}

Then the above argument shows that each orbit now contributes $n$, and each orbit is of size $n$, so the contribution now accurately reflects the number of points.

# Examples

1: $f(x) = x$ over $\FF_q$.

Define $X_q = V(f)$, then this has exactly $q  points over $\FF_q^{n}$ point for every $n$, so $N_n = 1$ and

\begin{align*}
\zeta_{X_q}(s) = \exp{\sum_{n\geq 1} \frac 1 n  (p^{-sn})} &= e^{-\log(1 - p^{-s})}= (1-p^{-s})\inv
.\end{align*}

> Note that the usual $\zeta_s = \prod_{p\text{ prime}} \zeta_{X_p}(s)$, i.e. Riemann Zeta is a product of Hasse-Weil zetas over all primes.

2. $V = \CP^1$ the projective line.

Here 
\begin{align*}
\zeta_V(s) = \frac{1}{(1-q^{-s})(1-q^{1-s})}
.\end{align*}

Corresponds to Riemann sphere, can check Betti numbers.

3. $V = \CP^n$:

\begin{align*}
\zeta_V(s) = \prod_{j=0}^n \frac{1}{1-q^{j-s}}
.\end{align*}

4. An elliptic curve:

$N_m$ is given by $1 - \alpha^m - \beta^m + q^m$ where $\alpha = \bar\beta$ are complex conjugates with absolute value $\sqrt{q}$.

\begin{align*}
\zeta(E, s)=\frac{\left(1-\alpha q^{-s}\right)\left(1-\beta q^{-s}\right)}{\left(1-q^{-s}\right)\left(1-q^{1-s}\right)}
.\end{align*}

# External Background

Here we fix a prime $p$ and a system of polynomials $S = \theset{f_i}$ of degree $n$, take the variety $V(S)$ and let

- $a_1$ be its number of points of $\FF_p$
- $a_2$ be its number of points of $\FF_{p^2}$
- $\cdots a_n$ be its number of points of $\FF_{p^n}$

Idea: assemble them into a generating function.

For unknown reasons, we put them in a zeta function instead: $\zeta(x) = \exp\qty{\sum \frac{a_n x^n}{n} }$.

Conjectures:

1. $\zeta(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ is a rational function.
2. There is an explicit formula $P(x) = \prod_{i\text{ odd}}^{2n-1} P_i(x)$ and $Q(x) = \prod{i\text{ even}}P_i(x)$ with each $P_i \in \ZZ[x]$.
  - For every root $r$ of every $P_i$, $\frac 1 r$ is algebraic
  - (Riemann Hypothesis) Every root has modulus equal to $p^{-i/2}$ (???)
3. (Functional Equation) The function $z \mapsto \frac{1}{p^n z}$ interchanges roots of $P_i$ with roots of $P_{2n-i}$.
4. (Under some conditions) $\deg P_i = \beta_i(V)$, the $i$th Betti number of $i$.


Relation to fixed points: In $\FF_{p^m}$, every point is a fixed point of the Frobenius $\Phi_{p^m}$.
So for any field $F \supset \FF_{p^m}$, the points in $\FF_{p^m}$ are precisely the fixed points of $\Phi_{p^m}: F\to F$ (because enlarging the field can not add more solutions).

Claim:
If $S\subset F^d$ is any subset defined by polynomial equations and $x = (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) \in S$ is a point, then $\Phi_{p^m}(x) = (\Phi_{p^m}(x_1), \cdots) \in S$.
Moreover, the fixed points of $\Phi_{p^m}$ restricted to $S$ are precisely $S \intersect \FF_{p^m}^d$.

Compare 2b above: Riemann says roots are along critical strip $\Re(z) = \frac 1 2$; this says roots of $P_i$ are on a circle of radius $p^{i/2}$ about the origin.
(Note: there is a (conformal?) map that takes the circle to the line, so we can send the roots of $P_i$ to the line $\Re(z) = \frac 1 2$....but not for all $i$ at once.)

Consequences:
Riemann-Zeta: error estimates in the prime number theorem agree with probabilistic models
Weil: error estimates in Ramanujan's $\tau$ is as small as hoped.

Proofs:
Grothendieck: 1,3, and 4 with etale cohomology. Notably not Weil 2.
Deligne: Weil 2, The Riemann Hypothesis 

Cohomology of Complex Grassmannian:
Schubert cells exhibit structure as a CW complex with only even-dimensional cells, and $H^{2d}(\Gr(k, \CC^{n+k})) \cong \ZZ^\ell$ where $\ell$ is the number partitions of $[d]$, i.e. solutions to $\sum_{j=1}^k x_j = d$ with $x_j$ weakly increasing, i.e. $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \cdots x_k$.
The ring structure is isomorphic to the ring of symmetric polynomials and is generated by Chern classes.
I.e. $H^*(\Gr(k, \CC^\infty)) \cong \CC[a_1, \cdots, a_k]$ (with $a_k$ Chern classes) which is invariant under the obvious action of the symmetric group $S_k$.

Example from end of paper:
The number of rational points on $\Gr(m, r, \PP_{\FF_q})$
\begin{align*}
F(x)=\frac{\left(x^{m+1}-1\right)\left(x^{m+1}-x\right) \cdots\left(x^{m+1}-x^{r}\right)}{\left(x^{r+1}-1\right)\left(x^{r+1}-x\right) \cdots\left(x^{r+1}-x^{r}\right)}
\end{align*}

and so the Poincare polynomial for $\Gr(m, r, \PP_\CC)$ is $F(X^2)$.



# Actual Paper

Considers equations of the form $\sum_{i=1}^r a_i x_i^{n_i} = b$.

Examples:

- $ax^3-by^3 = 1$ in $\FF_p$. ($p = 3n+1$, Gauss, when studying "Gaussian sums"/ "cyclotomic periods")
- $ax^4 - by^4$ in $\FF_p$ ($p = 4n+1$, Gauss)

Can consider corresponding variety $V$ over $\CC$, want to relate numbers of solutions to topological properties of $V$.

Fix a finite field $k$ with $q$ elements, $a_i \in k\setminus 0$, $n_i\in \ZZ_{>0}$, and first discuss $b=0$.

Definitions:

\begin{align*}
f: k[x_0, \cdots, x_r] \to k \\
f(x_0, \cdots, x_r) &= a_0 x_0 ^{n_0} + \cdots + a_r x_r^{n_r}
.\end{align*}

> Only monomials appearing? 

Example:
Take $k=\ZZ_2$ and $g: k[x, y] \to k$ where $g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$.

Non-example:
$h(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 + xy$.

Let $N \definedas \abs{x\in k \suchthat f(x) =0}$ the number of solutions over $k$.

> Note: shouldn't this be the number of solutions in $k^{r+1}$, since a "solution" is an $(r+1)\dash$tuple?

Example:
For $g$ above, $(x, y) = (0,0),~(1,1)$ are the only two solutions, so here $N = 2$

Define $d_i \definedas \gcd(n_i, q-1)$ 

Example:
For $\ZZ_2$, $q=1$ so $d_1 = \gcd(2, 1) = 1$ and $d_2 = \gcd(2, 1)$.

For an arbitrary $u\in k$, define

\begin{align*}
N_i(u) = \abs{\theset{x\in k \suchthat x^{n_i} = u}}
,\end{align*}

i.e. the number of solutions to $x^{n_i} = u$ in $k$, i.e. the number of $d_i$th roots of $u$.

This is equal to:

- $1$ if $u = 0$,
- $d_i$ if $u\neq 0$ is a $d_{i}$th power in $k$
- $0$ otherwise

> Not entirely clear why case 2 holds. Try for an example in the case $n_i = 2$ to compare to quadratic residues?

Define

\begin{align*}
L: k^{r+1} &\to k \\
L(u) = L(u_0, \cdots, u_r) &= \sum_{i=0}^r a_i u_i 
.\end{align*}

We'll consider the variety $V(L)$ defined by $L$.

This yields a decomposition

\begin{align*}
N &= \sum_{u\in k^{r+1} \suchthat L(u) = 0} N_0(u_0) \cdots N_r(u_r) \\
&= \sum_{u \in V(L)} \prod_{i=0}^r N_i(u_i)
,\end{align*}

i.e. any solutions to $f = 0$ over $k^{r+1}$ can be found by first choosing a point $u = (u_0, \cdots, u_r)$ in the variety cut out by $L$, so $L(u) = \sum a_i u_i = 0$, then picking an $n_i$the root $s_i \in k$ of each $u_i$ to obtain some $s = (s_0, \cdots, s_r) \in k^{r+1}$.
Then $u_i = s_i^{n_i}$ implies that $0 = \sum a_i u_i = \sum a_i s_i^{n_i}$, so $s$ is a solution to $f$.

Definition:
Let $G$ be a group and $V$ a vector space over a field $F$, then a representation is morphism of groups $\rho: G \to \GL(V)$.
For $V$ finite-dimensional, a character of $\rho$ is the function $\chi_\rho: G\to F$ where $g\mapsto \tr(\rho(g))$.
(Recall that the trace can be defined by choosing a basis for $V$ and taking the trace of the image of $g$, and is basis-independent.)
A character is irreducible iff ?

Lemma:
Let $G = \ZZ/n\ZZ$ and define $\lambda: G \to \CC\units$ where $1 \mapsto \zeta_n$ a primitive $n$th root of unity, then $\theset{\lambda^i \suchthat 0\leq i \leq n-1}$ is a complete set of irreducible characters.

Aside, maybe not useful:
The irreducible characters span the space of class functions $\mathcal{C}(G)$, so we can define a surjective map

\begin{align*}
\Phi: \CC[x] \to \mathcal{C}(G) \\
f \mapsto f(\lambda)
\end{align*}

and since $\lambda^n = \id_\CC$, we have $\ker \Phi = (x^n - 1)$, so $\mathcal{C}(G) \cong \CC[x]/(x^n-1)$ is a polynomial algebra.


Let $G = k\units \cong \ZZ/(q-1)\ZZ$, and let $\chi: G \to \CC$ be any character.

> Note: are the representations actually taking values in $\CC$ here?

Since $G$ is cyclic, let $\omega$ by any generator; then $\chi$ is fully determined by $\chi(\omega)$.

For $\alpha \in \QQ$ any rational such that $(q-1)\alpha \in \ZZ$, define a character

\begin{align*}
\chi_\alpha: k\units \to \CC \\
\omega \mapsto e^{2\pi i \alpha}
.\end{align*}

We extend this to a character on $k$ by setting $\chi_\alpha(0) = 1 \iff \alpha\in \ZZ$ and $0$ otherwise.

Let $S_i = \theset{\alpha \in \QQ\intersect [0, 1) \suchthat d_i \alpha \in \ZZ}$.
We can then write


\begin{align*}
N_i(u) &= \sum_{\alpha \in S_i}\chi_\alpha(u)
.\end{align*}

> Note: no clue why!

A priori, this is a countable infinite sum.
The claim is that it can in fact be reduced to a finite sum. (?)

We can then let $\zeta = \chi_{\frac{1}{d_i}}(u)$, which is $d_i$th root of unity.
Then $\zeta = 1 \iff u$ is a $d_i$th power in $k\units$.

Since both sides equal 1 if $u=0$, we can rewrite this as

\begin{align*}
N_i(u) = \sum_{j=1}^{d_i - 1} \zeta^j
,\end{align*}

and thus

\begin{align*}
N = \sum_{u\in V(L)} \chi_{\alpha_0}(u_0) \cdots \chi_{\alpha_r}(u_r) \quad \text{ where } \alpha_i \in [0, 1), ~ d_i\alpha_i \in ZZ
.\end{align*}

> Definitely countable due to the previous equation, hence the $i$ index. But where did the $\zeta$s go?

Abstract
=============

The primary purpose of this paper is to discuss Alexandre
Grothendieck, who is often cited as one of the most influential
mathematical thinkers of the century. In order to fully appreciate the
impact of his contributions, it is necessary to provide some
historical context in which to place his work, and to this end, this
paper will also discuss some the history, and mathematical content of
Algebraic Geometry, as well as several key figures in the field.

This topic was chosen because of the significance of Grothendieck's
accomplishments and the legacy he has left on modern mathematical
theory, but also because it allows place the field of Geometry in a
wider context, with a narrative that spans from the time of the Greeks
to the proof of the infamous last theorem of Fermat near the turn of
the century. In particular, the interplay between Algebra and Geometry
has a rich and storied history, including a unification between the
two fields that has advanced rapidly in the past two to three
centuries.

Treating this subject cohesively will require not only examining the
historical context, however -- in order to fully appreciate the impact
of some modern results, it will be necessary to cover introduce some
mathematical content as well. To this end, this paper does not seek to
provide a rigorous treatment of Algebraic Geometry -- many references
are provided in the reference section that serve this purpose quite
nicely.

Instead, such mathematical inclusions are meant to inform the
historical narrative, and so attention will be restricted to only
those definitions that provide a common and unifying language in which
to frame the results that are mentioned. It is often touted that the
field of Algebraic Geometry is somewhat obtuse and rife with "heavy
mathematical machinery" -- it is for this reason that a secondary goal
of this paper is to help demystify the subject, and perhaps provide
some motivations for why such mathematical machinery would be
invented, and why it has earned its place as a rich and distinguished
field of mathematical inquiry.

Ultimately, the goal of this paper is to discuss Grothendieck's
pioneering use of *schemes*, a construct introduced in his well-known
1957 'Tohoku' paper, which helped lay a new framework for Algebraic
Geometry and has driven advances in the field ever since. In order to
understand the significance of schemes, however, one must first
understand *sheaves*, the construct that schemes are meant to
generalize and extend. Sheaves, in turn, are in many ways defined
analogously to *manifolds*, which are often thought of as spaces that
locally resemble standard Euclidean space, and it is from this
construct that a great deal of geometric intuition can be derived and
used to guide powerful algebraic generalizations.


A Historical Perspective {#header-n30}
========================

The Greeks {#header-n31}
----------

Algebraic Geometry is among the oldest branches of mathematics, which
was studied as early as 400 BCE by the Greeks in the form of conic
sections. For the Greeks, in fact, the division between Algebra and
Geometry was perhaps indistinguishable in either direction. Without the
benefits of a numeral system amenable to calculations, nor the
convenient symbolic shorthand used in modern mathematics, the very
problems they studied were inextricably tied to the geometric situations
from which they were born.

![An Algebraic Identity Expressed Geometrically](figures/identity.png){#fig:my_label2 width="\\linewidth"}

Because the Greeks worked not primarily with individual number, but
instead *magnitudes*: lengths, areas, volumes, and ratios thereof.
Because of this, algebraic identities such as
$$(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$ would have been expressed in terms of
relationships between geometric figures -- in this case, perhaps as
rearrangements of certain squares and rectangles, as shown in the figure
above.

Of primary interest to the Greeks was the solution of algebraic
equations by means of examining the intersection of algebraic curves. In
this way, they were led to study the *conic sections*, those curves
which can be obtained by intersecting a plane with the surface of a
cone. In modern parlance, one might refer to such sections as those
traced out by real numbers $x$ and $y$ that satisfy a relationship of
the form $$Ax^2 +By^2 + Cxy + Dx + Ey + F = 0,$$ where the coefficients
$A$ through $F$ are also taken to be real. Despite not quite having the
algebraic notation to state the problem in this form nor the benefit of
modern analytic and algebraic tools, the Greeks were able to
characterize all such sections, yielding circles, ellipses, hyperbolas,
parabolas, straight lines, and the degenerate case of a single point.

![A Circle](figures/Selection_050.png){#fig:gull width="\\textwidth"}

![A Parabola](figures/Selection_051.png){#fig:tiger width="\\textwidth"}

![An Ellipse](figures/Selection_052.png){#fig:mouse width="\\textwidth"}

![A Hyperbola](figures/Selection_053.png){#fig:gull2 width="\\textwidth"}

![Two Lines](figures/Selection_055.png){#fig:tiger2 width="\\textwidth"}

![A Single Point](figures/Selection_054.png){#fig:mouse2 width="\\textwidth"}

Accordingly, the Greeks were aware of methods (for example) to solve
problems such as "squaring the rectangle", to which one might associate
equations of the form $x^2 = ab$, regarding the quantity $x^2$ as the
area of a unknown square and both $a$ and $b$ as known side lengths. In
their mathematical framework, all such constructions were necessarily
geometric in nature, and were thus restricted to those which could be
obtained with use of a compass and straightedge. In these terms, such a
problem might be cast as finding the solutions $x$ that instead satisfy
the cross-ratio $$\frac{x}{b} = \frac{a}{x}$$

A similar example is the problem of "doubling the cube" -- that is,
given a cube with known side lengths, constructing a second cube with
exactly twice the volume of the first. This amounts to finding $x$ that
satisfy a similar ratio, $$\frac{x^3}{a^3} = \frac{b}{a}$$ Considering
the simplest case of the unit cube led to questions concerning whether
number such as $\sqrt[3]{2}$ were constructible in the geometric sense
described above, a question that would remain unsolved until the advent
of the algebraic tools of Galois Theory in the century.

However, although in many cases the Greeks made use of coordinates,
their study of geometry did not have the same analytic flavor that it
takes on today -- the modern notion of a coordinate system would not
enter the mathematical zeitgeist until nearly the century, with the work
of Rene Descartes. Moreover, the classical study was restricted to
algebraic curves in at most 3 dimensions, and usually over fields such
as $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{Q}$, and so it remained until the "Geometric
Renaissance" of the and centuries.

Modern Times {#header-n42}
------------

Due to reverence of the infamous fifth postulate of Euclid, the study of
*synthetic geometry* -- that built on a collection axiomatic foundations
-- remained the dominant mode of Geometric thought. With the advent of
Cartesian coordinates, however, a separate study of *analytic* (or
coordinate) geometry began, coinciding with the beginning of the study
of alternative geometries based upon negating the fifth postulate.
However, the unreasonable effectiveness of coordinates in applications
to science and engineering endeavors, along with the invention of
Calculus in the mid century, led to the flourishing of the analytic
branch in favor of synthetic approaches.

And so it remained until roughly the century -- it was at this point in
time that it began to become apparent that alternative and equally valid
non-Euclidean geometries could arise from the negation of the fifth
postulate, leading to the study of elliptic and hyperbolic geometries.
In particular, during this period there was a resurgence of the field of
*projective geometry*, which was originally studied by Brunelleschi as
the "geometry of perspective" in the century, and reformulated in terms
of "points at infinity" around the century by Kepler and Desargues.

Around this time, a notion of *affine geometry* had also come into the
picture, which is roughly characterized as a generalization of Euclidean
geometry in which the notion of absolute distance is forgotten, and the
concepts that remain meaningful are instead the notions of parallel
lines, collinearity, and the preservation of certain ratios. It was
known early on that Euclidean geometry could be recovered as a special
case of projective geometry, and as affine geometry and new
non-Euclidean geometries were discovered, it was soon thought that *all*
such geometries could in fact be recovered in such a way, making
projective geometry a more general and universal theory.

A major proponent of this point of view in the century was Felix Klein
(of Klein Bottle fame), who sought to classify all geometries with his
*Erlangen Program*. He believed that projective geometry would provide a
unifying framework under which all other geometries could be united, and
introduced the idea that such geometries could be characterized using
the theory of groups. It was with the advent of Klein's program that
traditionally synthetic approaches found rigorous footing in analytic
and algebraic notions.

The Erlangen Program {#header-n51}
====================

Euclidean Geometries
--------------------

In particular, the *Erlangen* program laid out a framework in which any
given geometry could be categorized as a group of symmetries acting on a
vector space, and it is of some interest to see how such constructions
can yield familiar geometries.

For example, fix some field $k$ -- in the familiar setting, one might
choose $\mathbb{R}$, but many interesting ideas can be brought to light
by considering the general case. One can choose a coordinate system and
consider sets of ordered $n$-tuples
$$k^n \coloneqq\{ (k_1, k_2, \cdots k_n) \mid k_i \in k \}.$$ Equipping
this set with the usual point-wise operations of addition and scalar
multiplication, a vector space $V_k$ of $n$ dimensions over the base
field $k$ can be obtained. With a vector space in hand, one can consider
linear maps from $V_k$ to itself (sometimes referred to as *operators*),
and if $n$ is finite, these are entirely characterized by $n\times n$
square matrices. In particular, one can form groups of such matrices by
equipping them with the usual notion of matrix multiplication, and
examine the actions of these groups on $V_k$.

Since several such groups will be useful in recovering familiar
geometries, a few definitions are in order. In each situation, it will
be assumed that $k$ is a field, and $V_k$ is a vector space of finite
dimension $n$ over the field $k$.

::: {.definition}
**Definition 1**. The set of $n\times m$ matrices with entries in $k$
will be denoted $M_{n,m}(k)$. If $n=m$, this will simply be abbreviated
to $M_n(k)$, which denotes the set of $n\times n$ (or *square*) matrices
over $k$.
:::

In general, a square matrix is equivalently a mapping from $V_k$ to
itself, which can be realized via matrix-vector multiplication. One is
often interested in such mappings that are invertible, which prompts the
next definition.

::: {.definition}
**Definition 2**. The *general linear group of dimension $n$,*
$GL_n(K)$, is the group defined by the set
$$GL_n(K) \coloneqq\{ M \in M_n(k) \mid \det (M) \neq 0 \},$$ equipped
with matrix multiplication. Equivalently, this is the set of invertible
(and necessarily square) matrices with entries in $k$.
:::

The general linear group can alternatively be characterized as a
representation of the set of invertible linear operators on $V_k$,
equipped with function composition. For the purpose of this discussion,
this group is quite large, so we will be interested in certain
subgroups.

::: {.definition}
**Definition 3**. The *orthogonal group of dimension $n$*, $O_n(k)$, is
defined as the set
$$O_n(k) \coloneqq\{ M \in GL_n(k) \mid MM^T = I \},$$ equipped with
matrix multiplication, where $M^T$ denotes the transpose of a matrix and
$I$ denotes the unique $n\times n$ matrix that satisfies $AI = IA = A$
for every $A\in M_n(K)$.
:::

It can be shown $O_n(k)$ is in fact a subgroup of $GL_n(k)$.
Equivalently, it can be characterized by those matrices $M$ for which
$M^{-1}$ = $M^T$, or equivalently those for which $\det M = \pm 1$. If
one takes $k=\mathbb{R}$, these are exactly the distance-preserving
transformations (often referred to as *isometries*) of $\mathbb{R}^n$
that preserve the origin. Taking the dimension to be either 2 or 3
reveals that this produces a group consisting of both rotations around
the origin, and reflections *through* the origin.

In Euclidean geometry, one is also interested in translating and
transporting one figure to another point in space, which motivates the
next definition.

::: {.definition}
**Definition 4**. The *group of translations* in vector space $V_k$ of
dimension $n$ is denoted $T_n(k)$, and is equivalent to $k^n$, the set
of all $n$-tuples with entries in $k$.
:::

The above definition is a consequence of the fact that any translation
can be identified with a vector along which the translation occurs,
which does not depend on the point being considered.

Equipped with these definitions, we can finally define one of the main
groups of interest that will help characterize Euclidean geometry:

::: {.definition}
**Definition 5**. The *Euclidean group of dimension n* is the group
defined by $E_n(k) \coloneqq T_n(k) \rtimes O_n(k)$, the semi-direct
group product of the group of translations with the orthogonal group.
:::

The purpose of this definition is to capture some of what is already
known about Euclidean geometry -- it is invariant under rigid motions
(or isometries), which can, in turn, be characterized by combinations of
translations, rotations, and reflections about lines. It is these exact
types of motions that preserve the essential elements of classical
Euclidean geometry -- length, angle, ratios, parallel lines, and
intersections of lines.

While defining the notion of a semidirect product is perhaps outside the
scope of this paper, it happens to be the exact algebraic tool that
describes how such isometries can be constructed. In this case, it
captures the notion the if one first performs a translation, followed by
a rotation or reflection, this motion can equivalently be carried out by
first performing the rotation or reflection, and then translating by the
new rotated or reflected image of the original translation vector.

Taking a field such as $\mathbb{R}$ and the dimension of $n=2$, we find
that the vector space $\mathbb{R}^2$ along with the group
$E_2(\mathbb{R})$ provides enough information to recover classical
Euclidean geometry in the plane.

Affine Geometries {#header-n86}
-----------------

In the affine case, one is often interested in maps
$T: k^n \rightarrow k^n$ of the form $v \mapsto Mv + b$ where $M$ is a
linear translation and $b$ is another vector in $k^n$. These maps are
often called *affine transformations*, and spaces that result from
quotienting by this action are *affine spaces*, which are often
described as "vector spaces in which the origin is forgotten." Another
way of stating this is that allowing the morphisms to be combinations of
both linear maps *and* translations obviates the need for a
distinguished zero vector, and allows one to equivalently treat similar
figures without reference to an absolute coordinate system.

While this may seem like an abstract notion, it is, in fact, one that is
commonly and implicitly used by anyone who has worked with vector spaces
in any capacity: vector spaces are in fact affine spaces over
themselves. It is this fact that allows one to denote a *vector* in this
space by an $n$-tuple of points, and to interchangeably use the same
notation for a *point* of that space. Similarly, one commonly uses the
affine structure of a vector space when transporting a vector to a
chosen origin and treating it equivalently to the original vector.

Affine transformations are themselves more general than linear
transformations. For one, linear maps must preserve the origin, sending
zero to zero, while affine maps may not. In addition to the rotations
and translations present in the Euclidean case, elements of the affine
group additionally may induce both uniform and non-uniform scaling, as
well as shearing of figures. And in contrast to the Euclidean case,
affine transformations do not in general preserve angles and distances
-- they do, however, still preserve straight lines, and send parallel
lines to parallel lines.

In order to obtain this type of geometry in the framework of the
Erlangen program, one can carry out similar constructions to arrive at
the following result:

::: {.definition}
**Definition 6**. The *affine group of dimension $n$* is defined as
$Aff_n(k) \coloneqq T_n(k) \rtimes GL_n(k)$.
:::

As noted previously, the group $O_n(k)$ is a subgroup of $GL_n(k)$, and
so this result suggested to Klein and his contemporaries that Euclidean
geometry was, in fact, a restriction, or special case, of affine
geometry.

Projective Geometries {#header-n99}
---------------------

In the case of projective geometry, one wants to introduce a notion of
"perspective projection" in addition to the isometries obtained in the
Euclidean and Affine cases. However, in order to do so, one must forego
the preservation of parallel lines. This is a consequence of the early
study of the subject, with respect to capturing 3-dimensional images on
a 2-dimensional medium. This required the introduction of a point at
which all parallel lines in the image would meet, which is now referred
to as a *vanishing point* or a *point at infinity*.

![Using a Vanishing Point for Perspective
Projection](figures/vanishing.png){#fig:my_label width="0.8\\linewidth"}

To see why Klein considered Projective geometry to be the most general
and universal among the geometries known at his time, it suffices to
carry out a similar construction in the projective case. One first takes
a vector space $V_k$, constructs a group that will act as the symmetries
that preserve the desired properties, and identifies the geometry as the
space that remains invariant under such a group action. In the
projective case, the group itself is constructed in a slightly different
way, and so a definition from group theory is needed.

::: {.definition}
**Definition 7**. Given a group $G$, the *center* of a group $Z(G)$ is
defined as $Z(G) \coloneqq\{ g\in G \mid gh = hg ~\forall h\in G \}$,
the set of elements that commute with every other element of the group.
:::

::: {.definition}
**Definition 8**. The *projective linear group of dimension $n-1$* is
the group defined by $PGL_{n-1}(k) = GL_n(k) / Z(GL_n(k))$, the general
linear group quotiented by its center.
:::

The $n+1$ condition is the first noticeable difference, which arises
from the fact that a projective space of dimension $n$ is obtained from
a vector space of dimension $n+1$, and the projective transformations
(often called *homographies*) are induced by the linear transformations
in that vector space. Such projective transformations play an important
role in complex analysis, where one can realize the *Mobius group*
$PGL_2(\mathbb{C})$ as fractional linear transformations on the Riemann
sphere $\mathbb{C}\cup \{ \infty \}$, which could equivalently be
denoted the *complex projective line*.

It can then be shown that, for fixed $k$ and $n$, both the Euclidean and
Affine groups are isomorphic to subgroups of the Projective group, and
it is in this way that those geometries can be recovered as special
cases of projective geometry.

Into the Century
================

Post-Erlangen Program {#header-n112}
---------------------

Armed with the tools of the Erlangen program, geometry once again become
an active mathematical research topic and its impact rippled throughout
the and centuries. It was one of the first moderately successful modern
attempts to provide a unifying framework under which many disparate
parts of mathematics could be connected and derived from one another,
revealing new connections and insights.

It is a fact that the program was not all-encompassing - for example,
the recently developed Riemannian geometry did not easily fit into this
framework. But perhaps its most significant and lasting impact on
Mathematics lies in its cultural effects, and in particular, in the way
it affected how mathematical knowledge was organized and synthesized. It
proved the usefulness of having such unifying frameworks, a theme that
would become prominent in the century, and laid the groundwork for the
philosophy that would drive the development of category theory in the
1940s.

The Italian School {#header-n104}
------------------

Meanwhile, the field of Algebraic Geometry progressed somewhat
independently, but it became clear that affine and projective spaces
were fundamental to the subject, as were functions (and particularly
polynomials) on those spaces. Major work was done in this area in the
late and early centuries by a group referred to as "The Italian School"
in Rome, primarily driven by the work of Severi, Castelnuovo, and
Enriques. In order to discuss the significance of their work, however,
it is necessary to introduce several more definitions.

::: {.definition}
**Definition 9**. *Affine $n$-space* over a field $k$, denoted $A^n(k)$
is defined as the set of $n$-tuples $(k_1, k_2, \cdots k_n)$, along with
the information of the vector spaces $V_k$ of dimension $n$ over $k$ and
the action of the affine group $Aff_n(k)$ on $V_k$.
:::

In many ways, this is very similar to the vector space $k^n$ defined
previously, and in fact, there is a map $k^n \rightarrow A^n(k)$ that is
colloquially referred to as "forgetting the origin", and a reverse map
$A^n(k) \rightarrow k^n$ that amounts to choosing a coordinate system.
An affine space is chosen generally when one doesn't need the full
structure of a vector space, but would still like to consider notions
such as points, relative distances, collinearity, and the other
isometries preserved by the affine group.

If one then fixes some multivariate polynomial $p$ in the polynomial
ring $k[x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n]$ over $n$ indeterminates with
coefficients in $k$, one can examine points of the form
$$\bar{a} = (a_1, a_2, \cdots a_n)$$ in $A^n(k)$ such that
$p(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n) = 0$. The collection of such points is
referred to as the *zero locus* of such a polynomial, or equivalently an
*algebraic hypersurface*.

For example, take $k=\mathbb{R}$ and consider polynomials of degree 2 in
$k[x,y]$. In generality, the hypersurface of such a polynomial $p(x,y)$
will be defined by the relation
$$p(x,y) = Ax^2 + By^2 + Cxy + Dx + Ey + F = 0,$$ where the coefficients
$A-F$ are taken to be real numbers. But this exactly describes the
general equation of a conic section, as studied by the Greeks, and so we
find that this new notion of a hypersurface perfectly generalizes
algebraic surfaces such as conic sections, but allows for variation in
both dimension and base field.

This prompts the following definition:

::: {.definition}
**Definition 10**. Given a set $S\subseteq k[x_1, x_2, \cdots x_n]$ of
the form $S = \{ p_1, p_2, \cdots p_m \}$, the *affine algebraic variety
of $S$* is defined as
$$V(S) \coloneqq\{ \bar{a} \mid \bar{a} \in A^n(k), ~ p_i(\bar{a}) = 0~ \forall p_i \in S \}.$$
(Note that the set $S$ is sometimes referred to as a *system* of
polynomials.)
:::

In other words, one can take a number of polynomials and consider the
points where they *simultaneously* vanish, which is equivalent to
looking at the intersections of their associated hypersurfaces, and
combine all of this information into a structure called a *variety*. It
is these objects -- roughly speaking, the zero loci of polynomials --
that form one of the fundamental structures upon which much Algebraic
Geometry is based.

To see why such an object may be interesting, take $k=\mathbb{R}$, the
ring $k[x,y]$, and consider the polynomial $$p_1(x,y) = y^2-x^3.$$ The
variety $V(\{ p1 \})$ traces out an *algebraic curve* in the $x$-$y$
plane, shown in the first figure below. In contrast, consider also the
polynomial $$p_2(x,y) = y^2-x^3+x,$$ then $V(\{ p_2 \})$ is also an
algebraic curve, as shown in the second figure. Finally, consider
$$p_3(x,y) = y^{2} - x^{3}-3x^{2},$$ shown in the third figure.

 

 

An immediate qualitative difference is that $p_1$ has a "cusp" near 0,
where it may be unclear what the correct assignment of a tangent line
should be, while the second is "smooth" but also has a "double point" at
which there are two possible choices for a tangent line. The third, on
the other hand, does not seem to exhibit any such irregularities, and is
in fact an *elliptic curve*, an object with a rich analytic and
algebraic structure.

The types of irregularities present in $p1$ and $p2$ are in general
referred to as *singularities* of the curve, and so one might be
inclined to wonder what causes such singularities to occur, and if there
are perhaps conditions on the polynomials themselves that might
guarantee that the curves generated contain no such singularities.

Such questions drove many results in the classification of algebraic
curves and it was found that the *genus* associated to the curve, an
essentially topological property, was a powerful tool in such
classifications. It was the extension of these ideas to the
classification algebraic *surfaces* in higher dimensions that the
Italian school focused their efforts on. To this end, many results were
produced, but their results and methods of proof have remained
contentious throughout the century.

The Weil Conjectures and Grothendieck {#header-n127}
-------------------------------------

Various progress in other areas of geometry was made throughout the
first half of the century, most notably the advances of Hilbert and his
proof of the *Nullstellensatz* (roughly translated as "theorem of zero
loci"). Recalling that a variety was defined over system $S$ of
polynomials, where $S$ is contained in some polynomial ring
$k[x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n]$, one form of the *Nullstellensatz* shows that
if one wants to check whether the variety $V(S)$ is nonempty, one can
equivalently check whether $S$ is a (proper) ideal in this ring. This
firmly cemented the link between Algebra and Geometry, providing a
bridge that allowed many of the tools from either one of these fields to
be used in the other.

Around 1950, a mathematician named Andre Weil set forth "The Weil
Conjectures", three proposals that stem from setting $k$ to be a finite
field, considering the resulting varieties, and defining analogs of the
Riemann-Zeta function in order to count the number of rational points on
the resulting algebraic curves. Weil conjectured that certain properties
similar to the traditional Zeta function should hold, particularly with
respect to the locations of their zeros.

In doing so, he was able to formulate an analog of the Riemann
Hypothesis for these situations, and further conjectured that many of
the newly formed tools of homological algebra could be brought to bear
on such a problem. Homological tools had proved to be both powerful and
successful in topology in the first half of the century, and it was at
this point that many researchers were beginning to generalize such
theories and apply them to other areas. In particular, Weil suspected
that applying homological methods from algebraic topology to these
conjectures would have significant number-theoretic ramifications.

It is here that Alexandre Grothendieck enters the picture, as well as
his contemporary John-Pierre Serre, for within 15 years Grothendieck had
published solutions to two out of three of these conjectures. In the
process, he introduced many of the tools that would become standard in
modern Algebraic Geometry -- his major contributions being in the
development of the necessary homological tools, a cohomology theory for
varieties. Such contributions were framed within the recently developed
language of category theory, and included the definitions of abelian
categories, derived functors, injective resolutions, schemes, and
sheaves.

Grothendieck's general approach, which has gained traction widely across
mathematics in the resulting years, was noticing that certain classes of
geometric objects could be characterized by instead considering all of
the maps *into* that object from other similar objects. In particular,
this applies to algebraic variety -- one can associate to a given
variety a collection of particularly well-behaved functions on that
variety, the so-called "regular" functions, and in this way study the
variety itself.

This collection of functions constitutes the simplest example of a
*sheaf*, modulo a number of technical conditions. Perhaps more
surprisingly, this collection forms a ring. Given any ring $R$, one can
form the set of prime ideals of $R$, denoted $\text{Spec}(R)$, and even
equip with with a topology (what is usually referred to as the *Zariski
topology*. If one then introduces a topological space into the picture,
there is a construction entitled the *structure sheaf* on the space
which contains information about the functions on that space, and taking
a topological space along with such a structure sheaf produces what is
known as a *scheme*.

Although the construction of scheme itself is quite a bit more detailed
and nuanced than what has been described here, its power lies in its
similarity to notions in differential geometry, where homological
methods had been successfully applied prior to Grothendieck. It is in
this way that many powerful tools from the study of manifolds can be
generalized to work on algebraic objects, and similarly to allow
advances in the algebraic theory of rings to be brought to bear on
geometric problems.

However, such constructions proved to not just be limited to making
connections between geometry, topology, and algebra, but as Weil had
hoped, laid the groundwork for many of these tools to be applied to
number theory. This culminated in the celebrated proof of Fermat's Last
Theorem by Andrew Wiles in the 1990s, which built upon on many of the
tools developed during this period.

Conclusion
==========

In summary, perhaps the most notable influence of Algebraic Geometry on
the face of mathematics has been the bridges it has created between
different fields. In its study, many mathematical "Rosetta Stones" have
been built, allowing deeper connections to be built between seemingly
disparate fields of mathematics, and moreover making possible the
transport of powerful techniques across these domains. In the latter
half of the century, Grothendieck left the world of Mathematics, and
spent most of his remaining days in solitude, living in the Pyrenees
until his death in 2014. And although mathematics is not a lone
endeavor, it is particularly hard to overstate the singular
contributions of Grothendieck, for his ideas continue to shape how
modern mathematics is formulated.

# Why Care About Contact/Symplectic Geometry

*Open Problem:**
Does every triangular billiards admit a periodic orbit?

*Answer (1775):* 
Yes for acute triangles, there is at least one periodic orbit:

![](2020-02-01-23-59-05.png)

For arbitrary triangles: unknown!

Historically, the study of periodic orbits motivated the definition of *contact structures*.

**Definition (Hyperplane Field):**
A *hyperplane* field $\xi$ is a codimension 1 sub-bundle $\RR^{n-1} \to \xi \to M$ of the tangent bundle $\RR^n \to TM \to M$.

> See examples.

**Definition (Contact Manifold)**
A smooth manifold with a hyperplane field $(M^{2n+1}, \xi)$ is *contact* iff $\xi = \ker \alpha$ for some $\alpha \in \Omega^1(M)$ where $\alpha \wedge (d\alpha)^n$ is a top/volume form in $\Omega^{2n+1}(M)$

> Note that $\lambda \wedge (d\lambda)^n = 0$ defines a foliation?

**Definition (Reeb Vector Field):**
There is a canonical vector field on every contact manifold: the Reeb vector field $X$. This satisfies $\lambda(X) = 1$ and $\iota_x d\lambda = 0$.

> *Remark:*
> Contact manifolds are cylinder-like boundaries of symplectic manifolds; namely if $M$ is contact then we can pick any $C^1$ increasing function $f: \RR \to \RR^+$  (e.g. $f(t) = e^t$) and obtain an exact symplectic form $\omega = d(f\lambda)$ on $M_C \definedas M \cross \RR$.

> Any such $f$ induces a Hamiltonian vector field on $M_C$, and the Reeb vector field is the restriction to $M \cross \theset{0}$.


# Why Care About Contact Structures 

Let $M$ be a symplectic manifold and $H: M \to \RR$ a Hamiltonian.

For regular values $r\in \RR$ of the  Hamiltonian, $H\inv(r) \subset M$ is a submanifold $Y\subset M$ with a smooth vector field $X_H$ called a *regular level set*.

**Question:**
Does $X_H$ have a closed orbit on every regular level set?
What conditions do you need to guarantee the existence of a closed orbit?

Turns out not to depend on $H$, and only on the hypersurface $Y$.
The existence of a closed orbit is equivalent to the existence of a closed embedded curve $\gamma$ that is everywhere tangent to $\ker(\restrictionof{\omega}{Y})$.

**Question:**
When is such a curve guaranteed to exist?

**Theorem (Weinstein, 1972):** 
If $Y$ is convex.

**Theorem (Rabinowitz)**: 
If $Y$ is "star-shaped" (exists a point $p$ that can "see" all points via straight lines).

**Theorem (1987):**
Every contact-type hypersurface in the symplectic manifold $(\RR^{2n}, \omega)$ contains a periodic orbit.

**Conjecture (Weinstein, 1978):**
Let $(M, \xi)$ be a closed (compact) contact manifold with a Reeb vector field $X$ and $H^1(M; \RR) = 0$. Then $X$ admits a periodic orbit.

**Theorem (Weinstein, Dimension 3, Overtwisted. 1993):**
Let $(M, \lambda, \xi)$ be a closed contact 3-manifold where $\lambda$ is overtwisted. 
Then the **Reeb vector field** $X$ admits a periodic orbit.

# Definitions

**Definition (Hamiltonian)**:
A smooth function $H: M \to \RR$ will be referred to as an energy functional or a *Hamiltonian*.
If we have $H: M\cross I \to \RR$, we'll refer to this as a *time-dependent Hamiltonian*, i.e. the time slices $H_t: M \to \RR$ given by $H_t(p) = H(p, t)$ are Hamiltonians.

> *Remark:*
> If $(M, \omega)$ is a symplectic manifold, each $H_t: M \to I$ induces a unique vector field $X_{H_t}$ characterized by the property $\iota_{X_{H_t}}\omega = -dH_t$ where $\iota$ is the interior product.

**Definition (Symplectic Manifold):**
Recall that $M^{2n}$ is a **symplectic manifold** iff $W$ is smooth of even dimension and admits a 

- closed: $d\omega = 0$
- nondegenerate $\omega_p: T_p M \cross T_p M \to \RR$; $\omega_p(\vector v,\vector w) = 0~~\forall \vector w \implies \vector v= 0$.
- skew-symmetric: $\omega_p(\vector v, \vector w) = \omega_p(\vector w, \vector v)$. 
- bilinear: Lifts to a map $T_pM\tensor T_P M \to \RR$

    Send any form $\inner{\wait}{\wait}: V\times V \to k$ to the linear map $f: V \to V\dual$ where $f(v) = \inner{v}{\wait}$. If the pairing is nondegenerate, $\ker f = 0$, and we get an identification $V\cong V\dual$.

> **Important Remark**
> $\omega$ being nondegenerate yields $TM \cong T\dual M$, which can be combined with $\iota$ to obtain an isomorphism $\mathfrak{X}(M) \cong \Omega^1(M)$.
So we can freely trade 1-forms for vector fields. Very useful!
>
> MOST IMPORTANTLY: for any smooth functional $f: M \to \RR$, we can associate to it a vector field $X_f$.

**Definition (Hamiltonian vector field):**
Given a smooth functional $H: (M, \omega) \to \RR$, the associated *Hamiltonian vector field* is the unique field $X_H$ satisfying $\omega(X_H, \wait) = dH$.

> Remark: Conservation of energy
> Since $\omega$ is alternating,
\begin{align*}
X_H(H) = dH(X_H) = \omega(X_H, X_H) = 0
.\end{align*}

**Proposition:**
$(M, \omega \in \Omega^2(M))$ is symplectic iff $\omega^n \neq 0$ everywhere (c.f. Mike Hutchings).

**Corollary:**
Every symplectic manifold is orientable (since it has a nonvanishing volume form).

> **Important Remark:**
Symplectic structures on smooth manifolds give us a way to generate *flows* on a manifold (by defining a Hamiltonian or a symplectic vector field).

**Definition (Exact Symplectic Manifold):**
$W$ is an *exact* symplectic manifold iff there exists a 1-form $\lambda \in \Omega^1(W)$ such that $d\lambda \in \Omega^2(W)$ is non-degenerate.

> **Remark**:
> If $(W, \lambda)$ is exact symplectic then $(W, d\lambda)$ is symplectic.
> $\lambda$ is sometimes referred to as a *Liouville form*.

> **Important Remark:**
> If $(W, \lambda)$ is exact and $H: \RR \cross M \to \RR$ is smooth, then the *Hamiltonian flow* $\phi_H^t: M \to M$ is defined for all time and is an *exact symplectomorphism*.

**Theorem:**
There are no closed (compact and boundaryless) exact symplectic manifolds.

*Proof:*
\begin{align*}
\int_{\bd M} \lambda \wedge \omega^{n-1} 
&= \int_M d(\lambda \wedge \omega^{n-1}) \\ 
&= \int_M d\lambda \wedge \omega^{n-1} + (-1)^{\abs \lambda}\lambda\wedge d\omega^{n-1} \\
&= \int_M \omega \wedge \omega^{n-1} + (-1)^{\abs\lambda} \lambda \wedge 0 \\
&= \int_M \omega^n \\
&= \mathrm{Vol}_{\text{Sp}}(M) \\
&> 0
,\end{align*}

so $\bd M \neq 0$, and thus $M$ can not be closed.

$\qed$

**Definition (Liouville Vector Field):**
Let $(W, \lambda)$ be exact symplectic.
The Liouville vector field on $(W, \omega = d\lambda)$ is the (unique) vector field $X$ such that $\iota_x \omega = \lambda$.

> Remark:
> $X$ induces a flow $\psi^{X, t}$, and for any compact embedded surface $\Sigma_g \injects W$ we have
\begin{align*}
\psi^{X, t *} d \lambda&= e^{t} d \lambda \implies \\
\operatorname{Area}_{d \lambda}\left(\psi^{X, t}(S)\right)
&:=\int_{\psi^{X, t}(S)} d \lambda\\
&=\int_{S} (\psi^{X, t})^* d \lambda\\
&=e^{t} \operatorname{Area}_{d \lambda}(S)
\end{align*}
>
> This says that the flow lines of $X$ "dilate" the areas of surfaces at an exponential rate, or that $X$ is an "infinitesimal generator" of a canonical dilation..

> Remark:
> This is useful because even if $W$ isn't compact, we can obtain $W$ as the "limit" of compact submanifolds where we inflate along this flow.

**Theorem:**
A Liouville vector field $X$ satisfies $\mathcal{L}_X \omega = \omega$, where $\mathcal{L}_X$ is the Lie Derivative.

*Proof:*
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}_X \omega = [d, \iota_X] \omega = \iota_X(d\omega) + d(\iota_x \omega) = \iota_x(d\omega) + d\lambda = \iota_X(0) + d\lambda = d\lambda = \omega
.\end{align*}

> Use the fact that $\omega$ is closed, so $d\omega = 0$.

$\qed$

**Definition (Contact Type):**
For $(W, \lambda)$ an exact symplectic manifold, a codimension 1 submanifold $Y \subset W$ is of *restricted contact-type* iff $X$ is transverse to $Y$, i.e. for every $p\in Y$, we have $X(p) \not\in T_p(Y)$.

We say $Y$ is of *contact type* iff there is a neighborhood $U \supset Y$ and a one-form $\lambda$ with $d\lambda = \restrictionof{\omega}{U}$ making $(U, \lambda)$ of restricted contact type.

> Remark:
>$(U, \lambda)$ is of restricted contact type iff $\restrictionof{\lambda}{U}$ is a contact form.

**Definition (Hypersurface of contact type):**
For $(X, \omega)$ a symplectic manifold, a hypersurface $\Sigma \injects X$ is of *contact-type* iff there is a contact form $\lambda$ such that $d\lambda = \restrictionof{\omega}{Y}$.

**Definition (Liouville Domain):**
$(W, \lambda)$ is a Liouville domain iff $W$ is a *compact* exact symplectic manifold with boundary such that the Liouville vector field $X$ points outwards on $\bd W$ transversally.

> Remark:
> This condition implies that $\bd W$ is a contact manifold with contact form $\alpha = \restrictionof{\lambda}{\bd W}$.

**Definition (Isotropic):**
Let $\Lambda$ be the image of an embedded sphere $S^k \to W$.
Then $\Lambda$ is *isotropic* iff $\restrictionof{\lambda}{\Lambda} = 0$.

**Definition (Weinstein Surgery):**
Let $(W, \lambda)$ be a Liouville domain (although we won't need compactness).

> Recall: $(W, \lambda)$ is a $2n\dash$dimensional exact symplectic manifold with contact-type boundary $\bd W$ such that the Liouville vector field $X$ points outwards along $\bd W$.

Weinstein surgery takes 

- $(W, \lambda)$ a $2n\dash$dimensional manifold
- That is exact and symplectic
- With contact-type boundary $\bd W$
- Where the Liouville vector field points outward along $\bd W$

and produces a distinct manifold $(W(\Lambda), \lambda')$ with the above properties which is obtained by surgery along $\Lambda$ an isotropic embedded sphere.
Thus $W(\Lambda)$ is obtained from attaching a $k\dash$handle to $W$ along $\Lambda$. 

## Aside on Surgery

### Analogy: CW Cell Attachment

Given $X$, we can form $\tilde X = X^n \disjoint_\phi e^n$ where $e^n \cong D^n$ is an $n\dash$cell and $\phi: S^{n-1} \to X$ is the characteristic/attaching map.

> Remark: Why $S^{n-1}$? Really it's $\bd e^n = \bd D^n = S^{n-1}$.

![](2020-02-05-00-22-18.png)

Problem:
This doesn't "see" the smooth structure, and CW complexes can have singular points (e.g. $S^2 = e^0 \disjoint e^2$.

![](2020-02-05-12-25-15.png)

Solution:
Use *tubular neighborhoods*.


**Definition (Surgery):**
Given a manifold $M^n$ where $n=p+q$, then $p\dash$surgery on $M$, denoted $\mathcal{S}(M)$, result of cutting out $S^p \cross D^q$ and gluing back in $D^{p+1} \cross S^{q-1}$.

Let $\Gamma_{p, q} = S^p \cross D^q$, call this our "surgery cell".
As in the CW case, we want to attach this cell via an embedding of its boundary into $M$.

We can compute
$$
\bd(S^p\cross D^q) = S^p \cross S^{q-1} = \bd(\mathbf{D^{p+1} \cross S^{q-1}})
$$ 

then the above says
$$
\bd \Gamma_{p, q} = S^p \cross S^q = \bd \Gamma_{p+1, q-1}
$$

So fix any embedding 
$$\phi: \Gamma_{p, q} \to M$$

Note that this restricts to some map (abusing notation) 
$$\phi: \bd \Gamma_{p, q} \to M$$

So by the above observation, we can trade this in for a map
\begin{align*}
\phi: \bd\Gamma_{p+1, q-1} \to M
.\end{align*}

And so we can use this as an attaching map:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{S}_p(M) \definedas M\setminus \phi(\Gamma_{p, q})^\circ \disjoint_\phi \Gamma_{p+1, q-1} 
.\end{align*}


**Definition (Handle Attachment)**
Given a manifold $(M^n, \bd M^n)$ with boundary, attaching a $p\dash$handle to $M$, denoted $H_p(M)$, is given by $p\dash$surgery on $\bd M$, i.e. 
\begin{align*}
H_p(M)^\circ    &= M \\
\bd H_p(M)      &= \mathcal{S}_k(\bd M)
.\end{align*}

> Remark: we need conditions on the embedding of the normal bundle for this to work.

**Examples of Handles :**
$S^1 \cross D^2 \cong \bar T$, a solid torus.

A useful table:

![](2020-02-05-00-59-19.png)

> See examples of surgery

**Definition (Weinstein Surgery):**
We now add a $k\dash$handle along $\Lambda \subset \bd W$ to yield some $W'$, where $\bd W'$ is obtained by surgery in $\bd W$ along $\Lambda$.  

# Why Care About Weinstein Surgery

**Theorem:** 
Every compact contact 3-manifold arises as a combination of (2 different variants of) Weinstein surgeries on $S^3$.

> Compare to theorem: 
Every compact 3-manifold arises as surgery on a link.

**Theorem:** 
Weinstein surgery on a *loose Legendrian* knot yields an overtwisted contact structure.

> Compare: 
Every compact manifold is surgery on a link and admits a contact structure.

> However, not every compact 3-manifold $M$ admits a *fillable* contact structure $(M, \xi)$ (roughly: admits a symplectic manifold $(X, \omega)$ with $\bd X = M$ and some compatibility between $\xi, \omega$) -- need framing to be realizable as a *Legendrian* framing.

**Theorem:** 
Weinstein surgery along a loose Legendrian sphere yields an overtwisted contact manifold.

# Numerical Analysis Review

## Chapter 1: Error Analysis

- Taylor Expansion:
  $$f(x\pm h) = f(x) +hf'(x) + \frac{1}{2}h^2f''(x) + \cdots = \sum \frac{1}{k!}h^kf^{(k)}(x)$$
- Mean Value Theorem
  - $f\in C^1([a,b])$ implies $\exists c \in (a,b)$ such that $(b-a)f'(c) = f(b) - f(a).$
- Rolle's Theorem
  - $f\in C^1([a,b])$ and $f(a) = f(b)$ implies $\exists c\in(a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.
  - Just apply mean value theorem, so $f(b) - f(a) = 0.$
- Extreme values: occur at boundaries or where $f' = 0$.
- $f \in C^n([a,b])$ implies $\exists \xi(x)$ such that $f(x) = P_n(x) + \frac{f^{n+1}(\xi(x))(x-x_0)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}$, where $P_n$ is the $n$-th order Taylor expansion of $f$ about $x_0$, i.e. $P_n(x) = \sum \frac{1}{k!}f^k(x_0)(x-x_0)^{k}$.
- For any operation $\star$, in floating point we have $x\star y = fl(fl(x) \star fl(y))$.
- Magnifying error:
  - Subtracting nearly equal numbers results in small absolute error, but large relative error
  - Adding a large number to a small number results in large absolute error, but small relative error
  - Multiplying by big numbers or dividing by small numbers magnifies absolute error.
  - Can rationalize the quadratic formula to avoid near-equal subtractions
  - Always express polynomials in nested form before evaluating
- Convergence: if $\theset{a_i} \rightarrow a$ and there is a sequence $\theset{b_i} \rightarrow 0$ and a constant $K$ such that $\abs{a_i- a} \leq K \abs{b_i}$, then the order of convergence is $O(b_i)$. Usually, just take $b_i = 1/i^k$ for some $k$.

## Chapter 2: Equations in 1 Variable

- Bisection Method: Given $f\in C^0([a,b])$ and $f(a), f(b)$ of differing signs, want to find a root.
  - Set $a_1 = a, b_1 = b, p_1 \definedas ~(1/2)(a_1+b_1)$, and evaluate $f(p_1)$
  - If zero (or $\abs{f(p_1)} < \varepsilon$), done. Otherwise, look at the sign of $f(p_1)$:
    - If equal to sign of $f(a_1)$, repeat search on interval $[p_1, b_1]$
    - Else search $[a_1, p_1]$.
  - For an actual root $p$, we have $\abs{p_i - p} < \frac{b-a}{2^i}$.
- Fixed point iteration: at least one for every $g\in C^1([a,b])$, at most one if $\abs{g'} < 1$. To find roots of a function $f$, just let $g = f(x) - x$ and find a fixed point of $g$. Easy, since $\theset{\circ_i g(p_0)}_{i=1}^\infty \rightarrow p=g(p)$ linearly for any choice of $p_0 \in [a,b]$.
- **Newton's Method:**
  - $p_i = p_{i-1} - \frac{f(p_{i-1})}{f'(p_{i-1})}$. Stop when $\abs{f(p_i)} < \varepsilon$
  - This is just the $x$ intercept of the tangent line at $p_{i-1}$.
  - Converges quadratically.
- **Secant Method:**
  - Newton's method, but replace $f'(p_i) = \frac{f(p_{i-1}) - f(p_{i-2})}{p_{i-1} - p_{i-2}}$.
  - This gives the $x$ intercept of the line joining $(p_{i-1}, f(p_{i-1}))$ and $(p_{i-2}, f(p_{i-2}))$.
- **Method of False Position:**
  - Secant method, but always bracket a root.
  - If the signs of $f(p_{i-1})$ and $f(p_{i-2})$, proceed as usual
  - Else, chose $p_i$ as the $x$ intercept involving $p_{i-3}$ and $p_{i-1}$, then relabel $p_{i-2} \definedas p_{i-3}$ and continue.
- Order of convergence: if $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \abs{\frac{p_{n+1} - p}{(p_n - p)^k}} = \lambda$, then $\theset{p_n}$ converges to $p$ with order $k$ and asymptotic error constant $\lambda$.
  - E.g., $k=1$ is linear convergence and $k=2$ is quadratic.
- Fixed-point convergence can be linear if $g'(p) = 0$, $g''$ is bounded, and the initial guess is $\delta-$close to the actual solution.
- Zeros of order $m$ occur where $f^{(k)}(x) = 0$ and $f^{(m)}(x) \neq 0$ for $k < m$.

## Chapter 3: Interpolation and Polynomial Approximation

- Lagrange polynomial:

  - $$L_{n,k}(x) = \prod_{i=0, i\neq k}^n \frac{x-x_i}{x_k - x_i}$$.
  - Can then express $$P_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n f(x_k)L_{n,k}(x)$$ for a set of $n+1$ nodes $\theset{x_i}_{i=0}^n$.
  - Error: $f(x) = P_n(x) + \frac{1}{(n+1)!}f^{(n+1)}(\xi(x))\prod_{i=0}^n(x-x_i)$.

- Divided differences:

  ![1513038075145](1513038075145.png)

  - Can use this to make an interpolating polynomial: use the top diagonal as coefficients
    Then $$P_n(x) = f[x_0] + \sum_{i=1}^n f[x_0 \cdots x_n]\prod_{k=0}^i (x-x_i)$$
  - I.e. $P_n(x) = f[x_0] + f[x_0 x_1](x-x_0) + f[x_0 x_1 x_2](x-x_0)(x-x_1) + \cdots$

- Hermite polynomial:

  - Just take $x_i$ and defined $z_{2i} = z_{2i+1} = x_i$, and replace differences having zero denominators with derivative.

- Cubic Spline, satisfies

  - Spline agrees with $f$ at all $n$ points
  - First derivative agrees with $f'$ at all $n-2$ interior points
  - Second derivative agrees with $f''$ at all $n-2$ interior points
  - Boundary conditions:
    - 2nd derivative equals zero at 2 endpoints, or
    - First derivative agrees with $f'$ at 2 endpoints

- Counting degrees of freedom

## Chapter 4: Numerical differentiation/integration

- Differentiation
  - $f''(x) \approx \frac{1}{h^2}(f(x-h) - 2f(x) + f(x+h))$

- **Richardson's Extrapolation:**

  - Combine $O(h)$ approximations into $O(h^2)$ or better.
  - Let $M = N_1(h) + \sum K_i h^i$
  - Then $M = N_1(h/2) + \sum Kh^i2^{-i}$. Multiply by 2, add -1 times first equation to cancel $K_1$ term.
  - So let $N_2(h) = 2N_1(h/2) - N_1(h) $

- **Midpoint rule:**
  - $$\int_a^b f \approx (b-a)f\pfrac{a+b}{2}$$

- **Trapezoidal Rule:**
  - $$\int_a^b f \approx \frac{h}{2} (f(a) + f(b)) + O(h^3)$$.
  - Can derive by integrating 1st Lagrange interpolating polynomial.

- **Simpson's Rule:**
  - $$\int_a^b f \approx \frac{b-a}{6}\left(f(a) + 4f(\frac{a+b}{2}) + f(b)\right) + O(h^5)$$
  - Can derive by integrating 2nd Lagrange polynomial

- Composite: break up into piecewise approximations
  - **Composite trapezoidal rule:**

    - Take nodes $a=x_0 < \cdots < x_n = b$
    - $$ \int_a^b f \approx \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{h}{2}(f(x_{k-1}) + f(x_k)) = \frac{h}{2}\left(f(x_0) + f(x_n) + 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}f(x_i)\right)$$

  - **Composite Simpson's Rule:**
    - $$\int_a^b f \approx \frac{h}{3}\left(f(x_0) + 2\sum_{i ~\text{even}}f(x_i) + 4\sum_{i ~\text{odd}}f(x_i) + f(x_n)\right)$$

    ​

## Chapter 5: ODEs

General setup: we are given $y'(t) = f(t,y)​$ and $y(t_0) = y_0​$.

- **Trapezoidal Method:**
  - $$y_{k+1} = y_k + \pfrac{h}{2}\quantity{f(t_k, y_k) + f(t_{k+1}, y_{k+1})}$$
- **Midpoint Method:**
  - $\tilde y_{k+1} = y_k + \frac{h}{2}f(t_k, y_k)$
- **Euler's Method:**
  - Set $\omega_0 =y_0$, $t_i = y_0 + ih$.
  - Let $w_{i+1} = w_i + hf(t_i, w_i)$
- **Modified Euler's Method:**
  - Predictor/Corrector with Euler's Method / Trapezoidal Rule
  - Let $w_0 = y_0$
  - Let $\tilde w_{i+1} = w_i + hf(t_i, w_i)$
  - Let $w_{i+1} = \frac{h}{2}(f(t_i, w_i) + f(t_{i+1}, \tilde w_{i+1}))$
- Predictor-Corrector
  - Just do the same sort of thing that's going on in modified Euler's method above - use any explicit method to get an estimate $\tilde w_{i+1}$, and substitute that in to any implicit method for a better estimate.
- Linear Systems of ODEs
  - Just do everything by components, it works out.

## Chapter 6: Linear Systems

- The number of flops for Gaussian elimination is $O(n^3)$
- $LU$ factorization is $O(n^2)$
  - Howto: Given a matrix $A$, eliminate entries below the diagonal
  - Only use operations of the form $R_i \leftarrow R_i - \alpha R_j$, then $L_{ij} = \alpha$
- $PLU$ factorization: keep track of permutation matrices
  - Start with $I$, whenever an operation $R_i \leftrightarrow R_j$ is done on $A$, do this on $I$ as well.
- Partial Pivoting: Always swap rows so that largest magnitude element is in pivot position
- Forward and backward substitution for solving $Ax = b$:
  - Given $A = LU$, first solve $Ly = b$ for $y$ using forward-substitution.
  - Then solve $Ux = y$ for $x$ using backward-substitution

## Chapter 7: Matrix Techniques

- Spectral radius $\rho(A) = \max{\theset{\abs{\lambda_i}}}$
- Jacobi Method: an iterative way to $x$ for $Ax= b$.
  - Write $A = D + R$ where $D$ is the diagonal of $A$, and so the diagonal of $R$ is all zeros.
  - $$x_{k} = D^{-1}(b-Rx_{k-1}) = \frac{1}{a_{ii}}(b_i - \sum_{j=1, j\neq i}^n a_{ij}(x_{k-1})_j)$$.
  - Possibly easier to write $R = L + U$, then $x_i = D^{-1}b -D^{-1}(L+U)x_ {i-1}$
  - Define the iteration matrix $T = D^{-1}R$.
  - Converges when $\rho(A) < 1$
- Gauss-Seidel Method: another iterative method
  - Write $A = D + L + U$
  - $x_i = (D+L)^{-1}(b-Ux_{i-1})$
  - Iteration matrix $T = -(D+L^{-1})U$.

- Theorem (Smale, h-cobordism)
  - If $X^n$ is a smooth cobordism, $n\geq 6$, $\pi_1(X) = 0$, and $X$ "looks like" a product in algebraic topology, then $X$ is a product cobordism.
- Corollary (High-Dim Poincare)

- Theorem: Every compact manifold has a Morse function.
- Theorem: Morse functions are generic (given any smooth function $f: X\to Y$, there's an arbitrarily small perturbation of $f$ that is Morse).

  - Consequence: $M_0 \cong_{\text{Diff}} M_1$ is a diffeomorphism, useful to show two things are diffeomorphic, used in higher-dimensional Poincare.
- Theorem: If $X$ is closed and admits a Morse function with exactly 2 critical points, $X$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$.
  - Possibly used in Milnor's exotic 7-sphere (show a diffeomorphism invariant differs but admits such a Morse function)
- Diffeomorphism type depends on isotopy classes of attaching maps.

# Actual Talk

[Extremely good review](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~alexandru.oancea/BAMS-review-Stein.pdf)

Goal: reduce the complex geometry of Stein manifolds (hard) to the symplectic geometry of Weinstein manifolds (less hard). Study the space of structures up to homotopy.

## Stein

Moral: rigid, complex-analytic.

> Very rigid: uncountably many distinct biholomorphism Stein manifolds that are smooth $\eps\dash$small perturbations of $B^n_\CC$. So we study them up to deformation of the manifold, i.e. homotopy of the space of structures.

**Definition (a)**:
$M^{2n}$ complex-analytic, *properly embedded* in some $\CC^N$ (biholomorphically, can take $N = 2n+1$) such that complex structure is inherited from ambient space.

Data: $M$ and $J$ an integrable complex structure.

> Note: *properly embedded* here seems to mean $f:X\to Y$ where $f(\bd X)=f(X) \intersect \bd Y$ and $f(X) \transverse \bd Y$.

**Examples**:

- Any complex projective manifold $X\subset \CP^N$,
  - I.e. a manifold that is a projective variety; locus of polynomial equations in $\PP^n_\CC$.
  - Any algebraic variety over $k = \CC$ is (essentially) birationally equivalent to such a manifold.

- Any connected non-compact Riemann surface (or closed with a puncture).

- Any smooth compact $2n$ dimensional manifold with $n>2$ and handles of index $\leq n$.
  - $n=2$ case works with modification
  - Every smooth $4$ manifold admits a bisection into two Stein 4-manifolds.

**Why useful**:

- Supposed to be an analog of affine varieties (as per Wikipedia, but should probably be quasi-projective).
- Every Stein manifold is Kahler (compatible complex + Riemannian + symplectic structures), large class interesting to AG
- Amenable to Hodge Theory
- Homotopy types of CW complexes (admits a homotopy equivalence, as do all manifolds)


**Definition (b)**:

Consider $(M^{2n}, J)$ where $M$ is a complex manifold and $J$ the structure of complex multiplication on $T_p M$.

- Pick a smooth functional $\phi:M\to \RR$
- Associate the 1-form $d^\CC \phi \definedas d\phi \circ J$.
- Associate the 2-form $\omega_\phi \definedas -dd^\CC \phi$.
- Suppose $\phi$ is $J\dash$convex if the function $g_\phi(v, w) \definedas \omega_\phi(v, Jw)$ defines a Riemannian metric
- Then $\omega_\phi$ is a symplectic form compatible with $J$, i.e. $H_\phi \definedas g_\phi - i\omega_\phi$ is a Hermitian metric
- Suppose $\phi$ is *exhausting*, i.e. preimages of compact sets are compact and $\phi$ is bounded from below (?)

> Note on exhausting J-convex functions: origins seem to be in analysis of multiple complex variables. In nicest cases, boils down to the "Levi matrix" (analog of Hessian for $\del, \bar \del$) is positive semidefinite. This is an equivalent condition.

> The subspace of J-convex functions in $C^\infty(M, \RR)$ is open and contractible, so well-approximated by Morse functions (and the bigger class of *generalized Morse functions*: nondegenerate, restricted critical points).


Theorem (Grauert, Bishop-Narasimhan)
: $M$ is Stein iff it fits this description.

So a Stein structure is a pair $(J, \phi)$, a complex structure and a $J\dash$convex exhausting Morse function.

Theorem
: If $n=2$, $M$ admits a Morse function $f$ such that away from critical points, taking complex tangencies at the preimages $M_c\definedas f\inv(c)$ yield contact structures inducing orientations on $M_x$ agreeing with the induced boundary orientation on $f\inv(-\infty, c)$.

> A type of filling? Etnyre seems to work on this kind of thing.

## Weinstein

Aside:

Theorem (Gromov, Eliashberg)
: Any Stein manifold of dimension $n$ embeds holomorphically into $\CC^{\floor{3n \over 2} + 1}$, and this is optimal.

Moral: flexible, symplectic object.


**Definition**
A Weinstein manifold is the data of

- $M^{2n}$ a smooth manifold,
- $\omega$ a symplectic form,
- $\phi: M\to \RR$ an exhausting generalized Morse function
- $\xi$ a complete Liouville vector field which is gradient-like for $\phi$.

Subdefinitions:

- Exhausting: proper and bounded from below
- Generalized Morse function: non-degenerate critical points of only birth-death type
- Liouville: $\mathcal L_X \omega = \omega$, i.e. the Lie derivative preserves the symplectic form.
  - Recall
  $$
  \mathcal L: \Gamma(TM)\cross \Gamma(TM^{\tensor k}) \to \Gamma(TM^{\tensor k}) \quad \mathcal (\xi, E) \mapsto \mathcal L_\xi(E)
  $$ acts on vector fields and arbitrary tensor fields, in particular alternating tensor fields, i.e. $n\dash$forms.
  - Measures change of a tensor field wrt a vector field, giving a new tensor field. Reduces to lie bracket when $k=1$.
- Complete: flow curves of $\xi$ exist for all time.
  - Recall that the gradient operator takes scalar fields (functions!) to vector fields.
- Gradient-like:
  - $\nabla \phi(q) \xi(q) > 0 \in \RR$ for $q\in M\setminus \crit(\phi)$ (so $\xi$ "points in the same direction" as $\nabla \phi$)
  - Near $p\in \crit(\phi)$, we have $\phi(\vector x) =\vector x^t A \vector x$ where $A = \diag(-1, -1, \cdots, -1_k, 1, \cdots, 1_{n})$.

## Stein to Weinstein

Big idea: we want to study Stein structures by deforming them.There is a map from the space of Stein structures to the space of Weinstein structures that (theorem) is a weak homotopy equivalence
in the compact case, and is conjectured in general.

Goal: fix $M$, take $(J, \phi)$ and produce $(\omega, X, \phi)$.

> Really: Use $J, \phi$ to produce $\omega, X$.

- Fix $\phi$ an exhausting $J$-convex generalized Morse function
  - Theorem: every Stein admits one. Analogy: every smooth manifold admits a Morse function.
- Produce the symplectic form $\omega_\phi =-dd^\CC \phi = -d(d\phi \circ J)$ (**Item 1!**)
- By J-convexity, produce a Riemannian metric $g_\phi(v, w) \definedas \omega_\phi(v, Jw)$.
- Use this to define a gradient operator $\nabla_g$
- Produce a vector field $X_\phi \definedas \nabla_g \phi$, which is complete and Liouville and gradient-like $\omega_\phi$ (**Item 2**)
- Use the same Morse function $\phi$ (**Item 3**), now have a Weinstein structure.

**Theorem: homotopy-equivalent Weinstein manifolds are symplectomorphic**

Now choosing another $\phi$ yields a homotopy-equivalent and thus symplectomorphic manifold, so this association (denoted $\mathfrak{M}_\phi$ in the text) is unique/canonical.


## Weinstein to Stein

Theorem: there is a "weak homotopy inverse"to $\mathfrak{M}_\phi$, i.e. given a Weinstein structure $(\omega, X, \phi)$ there is a Stein structure $(J, \phi)$ such that $\mathfrak{M}(J, \phi)$ is Weinstein-homotopic (homotopy-equivalent?) to $(\omega, X, \phi)$ rel $\phi$, i.e. $\phi$ is fixed through the homotopy.

## Questions

Do these structures satisfy an **h-principle**? Origins (Gromov, 1970): given a PDE, a "partially specified" solution can be deformed into an actual solution.
The former have topological properties (and are amenable to algebraic topology), the latter analytic.
Recast, the inclusion of the space of "partially specified" solutions into the space of solutions is a weak homotopy equivalence.



## Morse Theory

Goal: handlebody decomposition, or for the purposes of the above theorems, retractions onto a CW complex.
Decomposing a cobordism into a sequence of elementary cobordisms (admit a Morse function with a single critical point).

Fact: since $\phi$ is Morse, $M^{2n}$ can be retracted onto a complex of dimension $d\leq n$, since all critical points will have index $\leq n$.

> Note: this immediately implies the Lefschetz Hyperplane theorem for affine manifolds $N$, i.e. that they are entirely determined by the homology and homotopy of $N\intersect H$ for any hyperplane. Very strong!

Setting up notation/definitions:

- $V$ will be a smooth $n\dash$manifold
- $W$ an $n\dash$dimensional cobordism
- $\phi: V\to \RR$ a smooth function
- $p$ a critical point of $\phi$ (i.e. the derivative $d_p \phi$ vanishes)
- $H_p\phi = ({\del^2 \phi \over \del x_i^2 \del x_j^2})$ the Hessian matrix
- $\null_\phi(p)$ the *nullity* of $\phi$ at $p$ is $\dim \ker H_p$, regarding $H_p\phi$ as a symmetric bilinear form on $T_p V$
- $p$ is *nondegenerate* iff $\null_\phi(p) = 0$.
- The *Morse index* at $p$ is the dimension of the maximal subspace on which the associated *quadratic* form $H_p \phi$ is negative definite.


Theorem (Morse Lemma)
:   Near a nondegenerate critical point $p$ of $\phi$ of index $k$ there exists a smooth coordinate chart $U$ and coordinates $\vector x \in \RR^n$ such that $\phi$ has the form $$\phi(\vector x) = \phi(p) + \vector x^t A \vector x$$ where $A = \diag(-1, \cdots, -1, 1,\cdots 1)$.

    Toward a generalization, we can also write $\RR = \RR^{k} \cross \RR^{n-k}$ and
    $$
    \phi(\vector x_1, \vector x_2) = \phi(p) - \norm{\vector x_1}^2 + \norm{\vector x_2}^2
    $$

Lemma (The nondegenerate directions can be split off)
:   If $\null_\phi(p) = \ell$ then we can instead write $\RR = \RR^{n-k-\ell} \cross \RR^k \cross \RR^\ell$ and
    $$
    \phi(\vector x, \vector y, \vector z) = \norm{\vector x}^2 - \norm{\vector y}^2 + \psi(\vector z)
    $$
    where $\psi: \RR^\ell \to \RR$ is some smooth function.


Definition
: A degenerate critical point is *embryonic* iff $\null_\phi(p) = 1$ and writing $L = \ker H_p\phi = \spanof_\RR{\vector v}$, the third directional derivative $D^3_{\vector v}\phi$ (?) is nonzero.

We now consider homotopies of Morse functions $\phi: I \cross V \to \RR$, where we can partially apply the $I$ factor to get a 1-parameter family $\theset{\phi_t \suchthat t\in I}$.

Definition
: A homotopy $\Phi: V\cross I \to \RR$ of Morse functions has a *birth-death type* critical point at $p$ at $t=t_0$ iff $p$ is embryonic for $\phi_0$ and $(t_0, p)$ is a nondegenerate critical point of $\Phi$.

> Recall what a Cerf diagram/profile is -- I don't

Theorem (Whitney)
:   In three parts:

    1. Near an embryonic critical point $p$ of $\phi$ of index $k$ there exist coordinate $(\vector x, \vector y, z) \in \RR^{n-k-1} \oplus \RR^{k} \oplus \RR$ such that $\phi$ has the form
    $$
    \phi(\vector x, \vector y, z) = \phi(p) + \norm{\vector x}^2 - \norm{\vector y}^2 + z^3
    $$
    2. If $p$ is birth-death type for $\Phi$ of index $k$, then up to conjugating $\phi_t$ by a (uniform in $t$) family of diffeomorphisms, each $\phi_t$ is of the form
    $$
    \phi(\vector x, \vector y, z) = \phi(p) + \norm{\vector x}^2 - \norm{\vector y}^2 + z^3 \pm tz
    $$

    3. Any two homotopies $\Phi, \Phi'$ with points $(p, 0)$ and $(p', 0)$ with the same index and Cerf profile differ only by a diffeomorphism, i.e. there is a family of diffeomorphisms $h_t$ such that $\phi'_t \circ h_t = \phi_t$ for every $t$.

    4. A generic $\Phi$ has only nondegenerate and birth-death type singularities.

Definition
: A singularity is *birth type* if the sign on $t$ is positive, and *death type* if negative.

Fact
: Embryonic critical points are isolated, near a birth-type singularity two nondegenerate critical points of indices $k, k-1$ emerge, and near a death type they merge and disappear.

> Pretty vague -- I know there are pictures here that make this more obvious, but I couldn't find much.

Definition
: A *cobordism* is a triple $(W; M_+, M_-)$ where $W$ is an oriented compact smooth manifold with cooriented boundary $\bd W = M_+ \disjoint M_- = \bd_- W \disjoint \bd_+ W$, where the coorientation is provided by the inward (resp. outward) normal vector field (???).
  We'll usually just denote this as $W$.


Definition
:   A *Lyapunov cobordism* is a triple $(W, \phi , X)$ where

    - $W$ is a usual cobordism,
    - $\phi: W\to \RR$ is a smooth functional that is constant and has no critical points when restricted to $\bd W$,
    - $X$ is a gradient-like vector field for $\phi$ which points inward along $\bd_- W$ and outward along $\bd_+ W$.

Definition
:  Such a cobordism is *elementary* iff there exist no $X\dash$trajectories between distinct critical points of $\phi$.


Theorem (Smale, h-cobordism)
: Let $W$ be a cobordism of dimension $W\geq 6$ such that $W, \bd_{\pm}W$ are simply connected, and $H_*(W, \bd_- W; \ZZ) = 0$.
  Then $W$ admits a Morse function without critical points which is constant on $\bd_\pm W$.

  In particular, $W \cong I\cross M$ is diffeomorphic to the trivial product cobordism, and $M\cong N$ are diffeomorphic.

Proof (Sketch)

Goal: find a handle decomposition with *no* handles, then integrate along the gradient vector field of a Morse function $\phi$ to get a diffeomorphism.

- Find a Morse function and induce a handle decomposition
- Rearrange handles so that lower index handles are attached first
- Define a chain complex as free $\ZZ\dash$module on handles with boundary given in terms of intersection numbers of attaching spheres $k$ and belt $k-1$ spheres
- Find $k\dash$handles, create a pair of $k+1, k+2$ handles such that the $k+1$ handle cancels/fills in the $k\dash$handle (not sure why the $k+2$ is needed here)
- End up with nothing but an $n\dash$handle and an $n-1\dash$handle -- turn "upside down" and repeat process with $-\phi$ to remove them.

Proof (Sketch)

- Pick $\phi: W\to \RR$ Morse such that $\bd_\pm W$ are regular level sets.
- Make $\phi$ self-intersecting (uses a transversality argument)
- Partition manifold into regular level sets $L_k \definedas \phi\inv(k - \frac 1 2)$ for each $k\in \NN$.
- Letting $\theset{p_i}$ be the critical points in $L_k$ and $\theset{q_j}$ the critical points in $L_{k-1}$, form the matrix $A$ of intersection numbers $S_{p_i}^- \smile S_{q_j}^+$ between the stable sphere of $p_i$ and the unstable sphere of $q_j$.
- Goal: since homology can be read off $SNF(A)$, and we know $H_* = 0$ here, we try to reduce $A$ to SNF with geometric operations
  - Handle slides: Add row $j$ to row $i$ by moving $p_i$ to $L_{k+j}, ~j\geq 1$, deform $X$ to produce a trajectory $p_j \to p_i$, then "the stable manifold of $p_i$ slides over the stable manifold of $p_j$" (?) replacing $[S_i^-]$ with $[S_i^-] + [S_j^-]$ in homology.
  - This makes $A = [I, 0; 0, 0]$ a block matrix with the identity in the top-left.
  -  Handle Cancellation: Take two transverse intersection points $z_+, z_-$ with local intersection indices $1, -1$, connect via two paths: one in $S_i^-$, one in $S_j^+$. This yields a map $S^1 \injects L_k$, use the Whitney trick to fill with an embedded disc $\Delta$, then push $S_i^-$ over $\Delta$ eliminates $z_\pm$.
  - This leaves a collection $S_i^-, S_i^+$ for $i=1,\cdots, r$ intersecting in a single point $z_0$, then (lemma) there are unique trajectories $q_i \to p_i$ for each $I$ and thus they can be eliminated.
- Do this in $L_k$; we now have a Morse function with no critical points except possibly of index $0, 1, n-1$, or $n$.
- Use "Smale's trick": trades in an index $k$ critical point for one of index $k+1$ and one of index $k+2$, such that $k, k+1$ cancel. Trade index $1$ for index $2, 3$ and cancel index $3$ as before.
- Eliminate $0, n$ with a lemma (unclear)

# Motivation

**Example (Hypersurfaces of contact type):**
The level sets of a Hamiltonian on $\RR^{2n} = \spanof_\RR\theset{\vector p, \vector q}$  given by $H  = K + U$ where $K = \frac 1 2 \norm{\vector p}^2$ and $U = U(\vector q)$ is a function of only $\vector q$.
(Usually kinetic + potential energy.)

> Remark: all hypersurfaces of contact type $(X, \omega)$ look locally like $X \injects \mathrm{Sp}(X)$, i.e. $X$ embedded into its symplectification.


Basic Questions: 

- Basic question: when does the flow of a vector field admit a *periodic orbit*?
- Does every/any vector field on a smooth manifold $M$ admit a closed orbit?
  - Corollary: does every/any vector field on $M$ admit a fixed point?
  - Note that if $\chi(M) \neq 0$, the Poincare-Hopf index theorem forces every vector field to have a fixed point.
- Does every vector field on $S^3$ admit a closed orbit?
  - Answer: no, very difficult to show, but turns out to hold for all 3-manifolds.

> *Remark*:
> The orbit of a Hamiltonian flow is contained in a single level set.



Example: Simple Harmonic Oscillator.

![](2020-02-03-21-23-02.png)


- $K = \frac 1 2 mv^2 = \frac{p^2}{2m}$ where $p=mv$ is the momentum, given by $F = ma$
- $U = \frac 1 2 kx^2$, given by Hooke's law
- $H(x, p) = U + K = \frac 1 2 mv^2 = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac 1 2 kx^2 \sim p^2 + x^2$
- Has "phase space" $\Phi = \RR^2 = \spanof_\RR\theset{x, p}$, i.e. a position and momentum completely characterize the system at any fixed time.
- Conservation of energy shows that the time evolution of the system is governed by $\dd{x}{t} = -\dd{H}{p}$ and $\dd{p}{t} = \dd{H}{x}$
  - Corresponds to a path $\gamma: \RR \to \Phi$ along which $H$ is constant, i.e. a constant energy hypersurface corresponding (roughly) to $p^2 + q^2 = \mathrm{const}$

	![](2020-02-03-21-26-35.png)

	- If the Hamiltonian evolved over time, this region would travel around phases space, with the *volume* of this region invariant.

# Intro/Motivation

## Space, but Which One?

- You run into a "space" in the wild. Which one is it? 
- How many possible spaces *could* it be? 
- How much information is needed to specify our space uniquely?

<img src="./figures/ASpace.png" alt="A Space in the Wild" style="height: 350px;"/>

---

## One Motivation: Physics

![Does your space have genus?](figures/SpaceWithGenus.png)

![Does your space have curvature or singularities?](figures/image_2020-07-31-01-53-20.png){ height=250px }

---


## Another Application: Data

![Can you only measure low-dimensional slices/projections?](figures/HighDimData.png)

- Possible to fit data to a high-dimensional manifold
- Makes clustering/grouping easier 
  - *(Here, slice with a hyperplane)*

---

![Does your space abstractly parameterize something else?](figures/ModuliSpace.png)

- Extract info about an entire family of objects and how they vary.
- Also useful for outlier detection!

---

## Where to Start

- What structure does your space have?
  
- What can you "measure" locally?

- How might it vary in ways you *can't* measure?

- Important question before attempting to classify:

  1. **What does "space" mean**?
    
    - Need to pick a category to work in.

  2. **What does "which" mean**?
    
    - How to distinguish? Need an equivalence relation!

# Q1: Types of Spaces

- Plan: compare classification theorem in topology and algebraic geometry
- Hopefully see some fun spaces along the way!
- But first: address classification and the notion of "sameness"

---

## The Greeks: Conics

- Early classification efforts: **conic sections**.
  - Apollonius, 190 BC, Ancient Greeks

- Key idea: realize as intersection loci in bigger space 

  - (Projectivize $\mathbb{R}^2$.)

![](figures/ConicSections.png){ height=400px }

---

- A conic is specified by 6 parameters:

\begin{align*} 
A x^{2}+B x y+C y^{2}+D x+E y+F=0 \\ \\
Q :=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
A & B / 2 & D / 2 \\
B / 2 & C & E / 2 \\
D / 2 & E / 2 & F
\end{array}\right), \quad \mathbf{x} = [x, y, 1] \\ 
\implies \mathbf{x}^t Q \mathbf{x} = 0
\end{align*}

| $\det(Q)$ | Conic | 
| --- | --- |
| $<0$ | Hyperbola |
| $=0$ | Parabola |
| $>0$ | Ellipse |

---

- Each conic is a variety
  - Can obtain *every* conic by "modulating* 6 parameters.

- $\mathbb{R}^6$: too much information: scaling by a nonzero $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ yields the same conic, so reduce the space
  \[  
  [A, B, C, D, E, F]\in \mathbb{R}^6 \mapsto  [A: B: C: D: E: F] \in \mathbb{RP}^5
  .\]

- Important point: $\mathbb{RP}^5$ is a projective variety and a smooth manifold! Tools available:
  - Dimension (what does a generic point look like?)
  - Tangent and cotangent spaces, differential forms
  - Measures, metrics, volumes, integrals
  - Intersection theory (Bezout's Theorem!), subvarieties, curves
  - Linear algebra and Combinatorics (enumerative questions)


---

- We can imagine a *moduli space of conics* that parameterizes these:

## Quadrics

Some Calc III review:

![Image](figures/QuadricChart.png){ height=650px }

General form:
\begin{array}{l}\scriptsize
A x^{2}+B y^{2}+C z^{2}+2 F y z+2 G z x+2 H x y+2 P x+2 Q y+2 R z +D=0 \\ \\
\text{Setting}\,\,
E:= \left[\begin{array}{llll}
A & H & Q & P \\
H & B & F & Q \\
G & F & C & R \\
P & Q & R & D
\end{array}\right]\,\,
e:= \left[\begin{array}{lll}
A & H & G \\
H & B & F \\
G & F & C
\end{array}\right] \\
\Delta := \operatorname{det}(E)
\end{array}

(discriminants), the equation becomes $\mathbf x^t E \mathbf x = 0$ and we have a classification:

> What is the moduli space? It sits inside $\mathbb{R}^{10}$, possibly $\mathbb{RP}^{9}$ but not in the literature!

---

## Automorphisms 

- Problem: infinitely many points in these moduli spaces correspond to the same "class" of conic

![Partition a Moduli Space](figures/image_2020-07-31-05-08-27.png){ height=500px }

---

- How to address: Klein's Erlangen program, understand the geometry of a space by understanding its structure-preserving automorphisms.

- For topological spaces: a Lie group acting on the space.

- Can then "mod out" by the appropriate morphisms to (hopefully) get finitely many equivalence classes



---

# What Does "Space" Mean?

---

## Some Setup

- **Algebraic Variety**: 
  Irreducible ,zero locus of some family $f\in \mathbb{k}[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ in $\mathbb{A}^n/\mathbb{k}$.
  - Equivalently, a locally ringed space $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ where $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a sheaf of finite rational maps to $\mathbb{k}$.
- **Projective Variety**: 
  Irreducible zero locus of some family $f_n \subset \mathbb{k}[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$ in $\mathbb{P}^n/\mathbb{k}$
  - Admits an embedding into $\mathbb{P}^\infty/\mathbb{k}$ as a closed subvariety.
- **Dimension** of a variety: the $n$ appearing above.

---

- **Topological Manifold**: Hausdorff, 2nd Countable, topological space, locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. 
  - Equivalently, a locally ringed space where $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a sheaf of continuous maps to $\mathbb{R}^n$.
- **Smooth Manifold**: Topological manifold with a smooth structure (maximal smooth atlas) with $C^\infty$ transition functions.
  - Equivalently, a locally ringed space where $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a sheaf of smooth maps to $\mathbb{R}^n$.
- **Algebraic Manifold**: A manifold that is also a variety, i.e. cut out by polynomial equations. 
  Example: $S^n$.

---

- Manifolds will be compact and without boundary, varieties are (probably) smooth, separated, of finite type.

---

## Impossible Goal

- Pick a category, understand *all* of the objects (identifying a moduli "space") and *all* of the maps.
  - Understand all topological spaces up to ???
    - Homeomorphism?
    - Diffeomorphism?
    - Homotopy-Equivalence?
    - Cobordism?
  - Understand all algebraic and/or projective varieties up to 
    - Biregular maps? 
    - Birational maps?
    - Locally ringed morphisms?

# Classification in Topology

---

## Topological Category

- Classifying manifolds up to homeomorphism: stratify "moduli space" of topological manifolds by dimension.

- Dimensions 0,1,2,3:
   - Smooth = Top. See smooth classification.

---

- Dimension 4: 
  - *Topologically* classified by surgery, but barely, and not smoothly.

![Surgery in Action](figures/image_2020-07-31-08-48-13.png){ height=600px }

---

- Dimension $n\geq 5$: 
  - Uniformly "classified" by surgery, s-cobordism, with a caveat:
  - $\pi_1$ can be any finitely presented group -- word problem
  - Instead, breaks homotopy type of a fixed manifold up into homeomorphism classes

![Surgery Classification](figures/SurgeryClassify.png){ height=500px }

---

## Smooth Category

Generally expect things to split into more classes.

- Dimension 0: The point (terminal object)
- Dimension 1: $\mathbb{S}^1, \mathbb{R}^1$

---

- Dimension 2: $\left\langle\mathbb{S}^2, \mathbb{T}^2, \mathbb{RP}^2 \mid \mathbb{S}^2 = 0,\,\,3\mathbb{RP}^2 = \mathbb{RP}^2 + \mathbb{T}^2 \right\rangle$. 
  - Classified by $\pi_1$ (orientability and "genus"). 
    Riemann, Poincaré, Klein.

![](figures/Connect.png){ height=500px }

---

- Dimension 2: closed + orientable $\implies$ complex
  - **Uniformization**: Holomorphically equivalent to a quotient of one of three spaces/geometries:
    - $\mathbb{CP}^1$, positive curvature (spherical)   
    - $\mathbb{C}$, zero curvature (flat, Euclidean)
    - $\mathbb{H}$ (equiv. $\mathbb{D}^\circ$), negative curvature (hyperbolic)
  - Stratified by genus 
    - Genus 0: Only $\mathbb{CP}^1$
    - Genus 1: All of the form $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$, with a distinguished point $[0]$, i.e. an elliptic curve.
      - Has a topological group structure!
    - Genus $\geq 2$: Complicated?

## Toward Algebraic Manifolds: Berger's Classification

- Every smooth manifold admits a Riemannian metric, so consider Riemannian manifolds

- Here $H\leq \mathrm{SO}(n)$ is the *holonomy* group:

- Berger's classification for smooth Riemannian manifolds, one of 7 possibilities.

## Enriques-Kodaira Classification

> Work over $\mathbb{C}$ for simplicity, take all dimensions over $\mathbb{C}$.

- Minimal model program: classifying complex projective varieties.

- Stratify the "moduli space" of varieties by $\mathbb{k}-$dimension.

- Dimension 1:
  - Smooth Algebraic curves = compact Riemann surfaces, classified by genus
  - Roughly known by Riemann: moduli space of smooth projective curves $\mathcal{M}_g$ is a connected open subset of a projective variety of dimension $3g-3$.

> We'll come back to these!

---

- Dimension 2:
  - Smooth Algebraic Surfaces: Hard. 
    See Enriques classification.
    
  - Setting of classical theorem: always 27 lines on a cubic surface! 

  - Example Clebsch surface, satisfies the system
  \[  
  \begin{array}{l}
  x_{0}+x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}=0 \\ \\
  x_{0}^{3}+x_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{3}+x_{3}^{3}+x_{4}^{3}=0
  \end{array}
  \]

## Interesting Space: Elliptic Curves

- Equivalently, Riemann surfaces with one marked point.
- Equivalently, $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ a lattice, where homothetic lattices (multiplication by  $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}- \{0\}$) are equivalent.

![Generalize to Moduli Space of Surfaces?](figures/image_2020-07-31-09-04-43.png){ height=750px }

---

- Definition: **Kodaira Dimension** 

  - $X$ has some canonical sheaf $\omega_X$, you can take some sheaf cohomology and get a sequence of integers (*plurigenera*)

\begin{align*}
P_{\mathbf{n}} (X) &:= h^0(X, \omega_X^{\otimes \mathbf{n}}) \quad n\in \mathbb{Z}^{\geq 0} \\ \\
\implies \kappa(X) &:= \limsup_{\mathbf n \to \infty} {\log P_{\mathbf n}(X) \over \log(\mathbf{n})  }
\end{align*}

---

## Dimension 2: Algebraic Surfaces

Every such surface has a minimal model of one of 10 types:

$\kappa = -\infty$ (2 main types)

- 1. Rational: $\cong \mathbb{CP}^2$
- 2. Ruled: $\cong X$ for $\mathbb{CP}^1 \to X \to C$ a bundle over a curve.
  
  - Called "ruled" because every point is on some $\mathbb{CP}^1$.
- 3. Type VII

---

![Our Old Friend the Hyperboloid](figures/Hyperboloid.jpg){ height=700px }

---

$\kappa = 0$ (Elliptic-ish, 4 types)

- 4. Enriques (all (quasi)-elliptic fibrations)
- 5. Hyperelliptic
  - Taking Albanese embedding (generalizes Jacobian for curves) yields an elliptic fibration 
    - *(i.e. a surface bundle, potentially with singular fibers)*
- 6. $K3$ (Kummer-Kahler-Kodaira) surfaces
- 7. Toric and Abelian Surfaces:
  - 2 dimensional abelian varieties (projective algebraic variety + algebraic group structure).
  - Compare to 1 dimensional case: all 1d complex torii are algebraic varieties, 
    - Riemann discovered that most 2d torii are *not*.
- 8. Kodaira Surfaces 

---

$\kappa = 1$: Other elliptic surfaces

9. Properly quasi-elliptic.

> Elliptic fibration, but almost all fibers have a node.

$\kappa = 2$ (Max possible, "everything else")

10. General type


# Interesting Space: Toric Varieties
- Definitions:
  - Define a *complex torus* as $\mathbb{T} = (\mathbb{C}^{\times})^n \subseteq \mathbb{C}^n$
  - Can be written as the zero set of some $f\in \mathbb{C}[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$ in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$.
    
    > Generalizes to algebraic groups over a field: $(\mathbb{G}_m)^n$ (analogy: maximal torus/Cartan subalgebra in Lie theory)
  
  - **Toric variety**: $X$ contains a dense Zariski-open torus $\mathbb{T}$, where the action of $\mathbb{T}$ on itself as a group extends to $X$.

---

![The Wide World of Polytopes](figures/ConvexPolyhedra.png){ height=700px }

---

- Flavor: spaces modeled on convex polyhedra
- Examples: bundles over $\mathbb{CP}^n$.
- Why study:
  - Model spaces by rigid geometry, generalize things like Bezier curves
    - Some are determined by rigid combinatorial data ("fan", or polytopes)
    - Combinatorial data for constructions in mirror symmetry, e.g. Calabi-Yaus (1/2 of one billion threefolds!)

---

## Kahler Manifolds/Varieties

- As complex manifolds:
  - A symplectic manifold $(X, \omega)$ with an integrable almost-complex structure $J$ compatible with $\omega$.
  - Yields an inner product on tangent vectors: $g(u, v) := \omega(u, Jv)$ (i.e. a metric)

![](figures/SpecialKahler.png){ height=400px }

---

- Examples: *all* smooth complex projective varieties
  - But not all complex manifolds (exception: Stein manifolds)
- Specialize to Calabi-Yaus: compact, Ricci-flat, trivial canonical.
  - Calabi's Conjecture and Yau's field medal: existence of Ricci-flat Kahlers (Calabi-Yaus) 

> Trivial canonical $\implies$ exists a nowhere vanishing top form = top wedge of $T^* X$ is the trivial line bundle

---

## Calabi-Yau

- Another from Berger's classification, special case of Kahler

![Calabi-Yau "Strings"](figures/Calabi.png){ height=600px }


---

- Applications: Physicists want to study $G_2$ manifolds (an exceptional Lie group, automorphisms of octonions)
  - Part of $M$-theory uniting several superstring theories, but no smooth or complex structures. 
  - Indirect approach: compactify an 11-dimension space, one small $S^1$ dimension $\to$ 10 dimensions
    - 4 spacetime and 6 "small" Calabi-Yau
  - Superstring theory: a bundle over spacetime with fibers equal to Calabi-Yaus. 
  
> *Roughly*, genera of fibers will correspond to families of observed particles.

---

## Calabi-Yaus

- As manifolds: 
  - Ricci-flat: vacuum solutions to (analogs of) Einstein's equations with zero cosmological constant
  - Setting for mirror symmetry: the symplectic geometry of a Calabi-Yau is "the same" as the complex geometry of its mirror.

  - Yau, Fields Medal 1982: There are Ricci flat but non-flat (nontrivial holonomy) projective complex manifolds of dimensions $\geq 2$.

--- 

- As varieties: the canonical bundle $\Lambda^n T^* V$ is trivial

- Compact classification for $\mathbb{C}-$dimension:
  - Dimension 1: 1 type, all elliptic curves (up to homeomorphism)
  - Dimension 2: 1 type, $K3$ surfaces

---

- Dimension 3: (threefolds) conjectured to be a bounded number, but unknown.
  - At least 473,800,776!

# Intro/Motivation

## Space, but Which One?

- You run into a "space" in the wild. Which one is it? 

- How many possible spaces *could* it be? 

- How much information is needed to specify our space uniquely?

![A space in the wild.](figures/ASpace.png)

## Possible Applications: Physics

![Does your space have genus?](figures/SpaceWithGenus.png)

![Does your space have curvature or singularities?](figures/image_2020-07-31-01-53-20.png)


## Possible Applications: Data

![Can you only measure low-dimensional slices/projections?](figures/HighDimData.png)

Possible to fit data to a high-dimensional manifold, makes clustering/grouping easier (here, slice with a hyperplane).

![Does your space abstractly parameterize something else?](figures/ModuliSpace.png)

Can extract information about an entire family of objects and how they vary.
Also useful for outlier detection!


## Where to Start

- Where to start the hunt: what structure does it have?
  What can you "measure", what does it look like locally?
  How might it vary in ways you can't measure?

- Important question before attempting to classify:

  1. **What does "space" mean**?
    Need to pick a category to work in.

  2. **What does "which space" mean**?
    Need an equivalence relation.

# Question 2: Which Space?

## The Greeks: Conics

- Early classification efforts: **conic sections**.
  
  - Apollonius, 190 BC, Ancient Greeks

- Key idea: realize as intersection loci in bigger space (projectivize $\RR^2$)

- Note the 6 coefficient parameters

- Each conic is a variety, and we can obtain *every* conic by "modulating* the 6 parameters.

![](figures/ConicSections.png)



## The Greeks: Conics

- We can imagine a *moduli space of conics* that parameterizes these:

- All of $\RR^6$ is too much information: scaling by a nonzero $\lambda \in \RR$ yields the same conic, so we can reduce the space
  \[  
  \thevector{A, B, C, D, E, F}\in \RR^6 \mapsto  \thevector{A: B: C: D: E: F} \in \RP^5
  .\]

- Important point: $\RP^5$ is a projective variety and a smooth manifold! Tools available:
  - Dimension (what does a generic point look like?)
  - Tangent and cotangent spaces, differential forms
  - Measures, metrics, volumes, integrals
  - Intersection theory (Bezout's Theorem!), subvarieties, curves
  - Linear algebra and Combinatorics (enumerative questions)


![Moduli Space of Conics](figures/image_2020-07-31-03-22-18.png)


\newpage 

## Quadrics

![Image](figures/QuadricChart.png)
\[  
\begin{array}{l}
A x^{2}+B y^{2}+C z^{2}+2 F y z+2 G z x+2 H x y+2 P x+2 Q y+2 R z +D=0 \\ \\
\text{Setting} \quad 
E\definedas \left[\begin{array}{llll}
A & H & Q & P \\
H & B & F & Q \\
G & F & C & R \\
P & Q & R & D
\end{array}\right] \qquad 
e\definedas \left[\begin{array}{lll}
A & H & G \\
H & B & F \\
G & F & C
\end{array}\right] \qquad 
\Delta \definedas \operatorname{det}(E)
\end{array}
\]

(discriminants), the equation becomes $\vector x^t E \vector x = 0$ and we have a classification:

![Classification of quadrics](figures/17Quadrics.png)

> What is the moduli space? It sits inside $\RR^{16}$, possibly $\RP^{15}$ but not in the literature.


## Automorphisms 

- Problem: infinitely many points in these moduli spaces correspond to the same "class" of conic

- How to address: Klein's Erlangen program, understand the geometry of a space by understanding its structure-preserving automorphisms.

  - For affine space $\AA^n_\KK$: $\mathrm{Aff}(\AA^n_\KK) = \AA^n_\KK \semidirect_\psi \GL(\AA^n_\KK)$, i.e. "twist" a translation with an non-singular linear transformation.
  - For Euclidean space, want isomoetries.
    $\RR^n$: can "reduce structure groups" to get $\RR^n \semidirect_\psi O(n, \RR)$, i.e. a rotation and a translation.
    - Can restrict to orientation preserving: $\RR^n \semidirect_\psi SO(n, \RR)$.
  - For topological spaces: a Lie group.

- Can then "mod out" by the appropriate morphisms to (hopefully) get finitely many equivalence classes


![Partition a Moduli Space](figures/image_2020-07-31-05-08-27.png)

# What Does "Space" Mean?

## Some Setup

- **Algebraic Variety**: 
  Irreducible ,zero locus of some family $f\in \kk[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ in $\AA^n/\kk$.
  - Equivalently, a locally ringed space $(X, \OO_X)$ where $\OO_X$ is a sheaf of finite rational maps to $\kk$.
- **Projective Variety**: 
  Irreducible zero locus of some family $f_n \subset \kk[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$ in $\PP^n/\kk$
  - Admits an embedding into $\PP^n/\kk$ as a closed subvariety.
- **Dimension** of a variety: the $n$ appearing above.
- **Topological Manifold**: Hausdorff, 2nd Countable, topological space, locally homeomorphic to $\RR^n$. 
  - Equivalently, a locally ringed space where $\OO_X$ is a sheaf of continuous maps to $\RR^n$.
- **Smooth Manifold**: Topological manifold with a smooth structure (maximal smooth atlas) with $C^\infty$ transition functions.
  - Equivalently, a locally ringed space where $\OO_X$ is a sheaf of smooth maps to $\RR^n$.
- **Algebraic Manifold**: A manifold that is also a variety, i.e. cut out by polynomial equations. 
  Example: $S^n$.

## Impossible Goal

- Notation: most dimensions will be over $\RR$, manifolds will be compact and without boundary, varieties are (probably) smooth, separated, of finite type.

- **Impossible Goal**: pick a category, understand *all* of the objects (identifying a moduli "space") and *all* of the maps.
  - Understand all topological spaces up to ???
    - Homeomorphism?
    - Diffeomorphism?
    - Homotopy-Equivalence?
    - Cobordism?
  - Understand all algebraic and/or projective varieties up to 
    - Biregular maps? 
    - Birational maps?
    - Locally ringed morphisms?

# Classification in Topology

- Two main categories with a forgetful functor: $\mathbf{Diff} \to \mathbf{Top}$.

  - What's in the "image" of this functor? 
    - Manifolds that admit a differentiable structure.

  - What is the "fiber" above a given topological manifold? 
    - Distinct differentiable structures.

- Classifying manifolds: considered open in a few directions, current work in classifying morphisms (mapping class groups, Torelli groups), knot theory, embeddings/immersions/submersions/isometries

- General slogan: classified by geometric data in low dimensions ($\leq 4$), algebraic data in high dimensions

## Topological Category

Classifying manifolds up to homeomorphism: stratify "moduli space" of topological manifolds by dimension.

- Dimensions 0,1,2,3:
   - Smooth = Top. See smooth classification.
- Dimension 4: 
  - *Topologically* classified by surgery, but barely, and not smoothly.
- Dimension $n\geq 5$: 
  - Uniformly "classified" by surgery, s-cobordism, with a caveat:
  - $\pi_1$ can be any finitely presented group -- word problem
  - Instead, breaks homotopy type of a fixed manifold up into homeomorphism classes

![Surgery in Action](figures/image_2020-07-31-08-48-13.png)

![Surgery Classification](figures/SurgeryClassify.png)





# Classification in Algebraic Geometry

## [Enriques-Kodaira Classification](Enriques-Kodaira%20Classification)



## Interesting Space: Elliptic Curves

- Equivalently, Riemann surfaces with one marked point.
- Equivalently, $\CC/\Lambda$ a lattice, where homothetic lattices (multiplication by  $\lambda \in \CC\smz$) are equivalent.
- Generalize to $\CC^n/\Lambda$ to obtain *abelian varieties*.


![Elliptic Curves as Plane Curves](figures/Elliptic.png)

![Complex Curves as Real Surfaces](figures/image_2020-07-31-08-51-42.png)

## Interesting Space: Moduli of Elliptic Curves
- $\mcm_g$: the moduli space of compact Riemann surfaces (curves) of genus $g$, i.e. elliptic curves.

- Parameterized by a moduli space:
  - For $X = \CC/\Lambda$ choose a positively oriented basis 
   $\Lambda = z\ZZ \oplus w\ZZ$.
    - Note: push into meridians on a torus, generators of $H_1(X)$, and require that their intersection is $+1$.
  - Replace $\thevector{z, w}$ with $\thevector{1, \tau}$ where $\tau = {w\over z}$; the orientation condition forces $\Im(\tau) > 0$ so this yields a point $\tau \in \HH$.
  - Account for automorphisms: roughly $\SL(2, \ZZ)$.

![Approximately the Actual Space](figures/CloserToTheActualSpace.png)

\newpage

## Dimension 2: Algebraic Surfaces

![Aristic License](figures/image_2020-07-31-09-04-43.png)

- Definition: **Kodaira Dimension** 
  - Given a projective variety $X$ of dimension complex dimension 2..
  - Use the canonical bundle to *try* to get a rational map $f: \Sigma \to \CP^\infty$
  So define $\kappa(\Sigma) = \dim_\CC(f(\Sigma))$
    - *(really, take a maximum dimension over a linear system)*
  - If this doesn't work, set dimension to $-\infty$.

- Fact:
\[
\kappa(X) \in \theset{-\infty, 0, 1, \cdots, \dim_\CC(X)}
.\]

- Alternative definition: 

  - $X$ has some canonical sheaf $\omega_X$, you can take some sheaf cohomology and get a sequence of integers (*plurigenera*)
\[  
P_{\mathbf{n}} (X) &\definedas h^0(X, \omega_X^{\tensor \mathbf{n}}) \quad n\in \ZZ^{\geq 0} \\ \\
\implies \kappa(X) &\definedas \limsup_{\mathbf n \to \infty} {\log P_{\mathbf n}(X) \over \log(\mathbf{n})  }
.\]

> Due to Kunihiko Kodaira's classification of complex surfaces, we know that any compact hyperkähler 4-manifold is either a K3 surface or a compact torus T^{4}. (Every Calabi–Yau manifold in 4 (real) dimensions is a hyperkähler manifold, because SU(2) is isomorphic to Sp(1).)

> As was discovered by Beauville, the Hilbert scheme of k points on a compact hyperkähler 4-manifold is a hyperkähler manifold of dimension 4k. This gives rise to two series of compact examples: Hilbert schemes of points on a K3 surface and generalized Kummer varieties.

# Setup

- All manifolds: 
  - Connected
  - Oriented
  - 2nd countable (countable basis)
  - Hausdorff (separate with disjoint neighborhoods, uniqueness of limits)
  - With boundary (possibly empty)

- Weakly Hausdorff: every continuous image of a compact Hausdorff space into it is closed.

- Compactly generated: sets are closed iff their intersection with every compact subspace is closed.

- Curves: simple, closed, oriented

- Surfaces: these guys

![More surfaces](figures/image_2020-09-28-01-02-30.png)

- For $X, Y$ topological spaces, consider 
  \[  
  Y^X = C(X, Y) = \hom_\Top(X, Y) \da \ts{f: X\to Y \st f\,\,\text{is continuous}}
  .\]


\newpage

## The Compact-Open Topology

- General idea: *cartesian closed* categories, require *exponential objects* or *internal homs*: i.e. for every hom set, there is some object in the category that represents it 
  - Slogan: we'd like homs to be spaces.
  
- Can make this work if we assume WHCG: weakly Hausdorff and compactly generated.

- Topologize with the *compact-open* topology $\OO_{\text{CO}}$: 
\[  
U \in \OO_{\text{CO}} \iff 
\forall f\in U, \quad f(K) \subset Y \text{ is open for every compact } K\subseteq X
.\]


### Mapping Spaces

- So define
\[  
\Map(X, Y) \da (\hom_\Top(X, Y), \OO_{\text{CO}}) \qquad\text{where }\OO_{\text{CO}}\text{ is the compact-open topology}
.\]

- Can immediately define interesting derived spaces:

  - $\Homeo(X, Y)$ the subspace of homeomorphisms
  - $\mathrm{Imm}(X, Y)$, the subspace of immersions (injective map on tangent spaces)
  - $\mathrm{Emb}(X, Y)$, the subspace of embeddings (immersion + diffeomorphic onto image)
  - $C^k(X, Y)$, the subspace of $k\times$ differentiable maps
  - $C^\infty(X, Y)$ the subspace of smooth maps
  - $\mathrm{Diffeo}(X ,Y)$ the subspace of diffeomorphisms
  - $C^\omega(X, Y)$ the subspace of analytic maps
  - $\mathrm{Isom}(X, Y)$ the subspace of isometric maps (for Riemannian metrics)
  - $[X, Y]$ homotopy classes of maps


\newpage

## Aside on Analysis 

- If $Y = (Y, d)$ is a metric space, this is the topology of "uniform convergence on compact sets": for $f_n \to f$ in this topology iff 
\[  
\norm{f_n - f}_{\infty, K} \da \sup \ts{d(f_n(x), f(x)) \st x\in K}\converges{n\to\infty}\to 0 \quad \forall K\subseteq X \,\,\text{compact}
.\]

  - In words: $f_n\to f$ uniformly on every compact set.


- If $X$ itself is compact and $Y$ is a metric space, $C(X, Y)$ can be promoted to a metric space with 

\[
d(f, g) = \sup_{x\in X}(f(x), g(x))
.\]

\newpage

---

# Path Spaces

- Can immediately consider some interesting spaces via the functor $\Map(\wait, Y)$:
\[  
X = \pt &\leadsto \quad \Map(\pt, Y) \cong Y \\
X= I &\leadsto\quad \mathcal{P}Y  \da \ts{f: I\to Y} = Y^I  \\
X= S^1 &\leadsto\quad \mathcal{L}Y  \da \ts{f: S^1\to Y } = Y^{S^1} 
.\]

- Adjoint property: there is a homeomorphism
\[  
\Map(X\cross Z, Y) &\leftrightarrow_{\cong} \Map(Z, Y^X) \\
H:X\cross Z \to Y &\iff \tilde H: Z\to \Map(X, Y)\\
(x, z) \mapsto H(x,z) &\iff z \mapsto H(\wait, z)
.\]

  - Categorically, $\hom(X, \wait) \leftrightarrow (X\cross \wait)$ form an adjoint pair in $\Top$.

  - A form of this adjunction holds in any cartesian closed category (terminal objects, products, and exponentials)


\newpage

## Homotopy and Isotopy in Terms of Path Spaces

- Can take basepoints to obtain the base path space $PY$, the based loop space $\Omega Y$.

- Importance in homotopy theory: the path space fibration 
\[ 
\Omega Y \injects PY \mapsvia{\gamma \mapsto \gamma(1)} Y
\]

  - Plays a role in "homotopy replacement", allows you to assume everything is a fibration and use homotopy long exact sequences.


- Fun fact: with some mild point-set conditions (Locally compact and Hausdorff),
\[  
\pi_0 \Map(X, Y) = \ts{[f],\, \text{homotopy classes of maps }f: X\to Y}
,\]
i.e. two maps $f, g$ are homotopic $\iff$ they are connected by a path in $\Map(X, Y)$.

  > Picture!

\newpage 

### Proof
\[  
  \mathcal{P}\Map(X, Y) = \Map(I, Y^X) \cong \Map(X\cross I, Y)
,\]
  and just check that $\gamma(0) = f \iff H(x, 0) = f$ and $\gamma(1) = g \iff H(x, 1) = g$.

  - Interpretation: the RHS contains homotopies for maps $X\to Y$, the LHS are paths in the space of maps.

\newpage

# Defining the Mapping Class Group

## Isotopy

- Define a homotopy between $f, g: X\to Y$ as a map $F:X\cross I \to Y$ restricting to $f, g$ on the ends.
  - Equivalently: a *path*, an element of $\Map(I, C(X, Y))$.
- Isotopy: require the partially-applied function $F_t:X\to Y$ to be homeomorphisms for every $t$.
  - Equivalently: a path in the subspace of homeomorphisms, an element of $\Map(I, \Homeo(X, Y))$

> Picture: picture of homotopy, paths in $\Map(X, Y)$, subspace of homeomorphisms.

\newpage

## Self-Homeomorphisms

- In any category, the automorphisms form a group. 

  - In a general category $\mathcal{C}$, we can always define the group $\Aut_{\mathcal{C}}(X)$.
    - If the group has a topology, we can consider $\pi_0 \Aut_{\mathcal{C}}(X)$, the set of path components.
    - Since groups have identities, we can consider $\Aut^0_{\mathcal{C}}(X)$, the path component containing the identity.

  - So we make a general definition, the *extended mapping class group*:
  \[  
  \MCG^\pm_{\mathcal{C}}(X) \da \Aut_{\mathcal{C}}(X) / \Aut_{\mathcal{C}}^0(X)
  .\]

  - Here the $\pm$ indicates that we take both orientation preserving and non-preserving automorphisms.

  - Has an index 2 subgroup of orientation-preserving automorphisms, $\MCG^+(X)$.

  - Can define $\MCG_\bd(X)$ as those that restrict to the identity on $\bd X$.

> Picture: quotienting out by identity component

\newpage

## Definitions in Several Categories

- Now restrict attention to
\[  
\Homeo(X) \da \Aut_{\Top}(X) = \ts{f\in \Map(X, X) \st f \text{ is an isomorphism}} \\
\qquad\text{equipped with }\OO_{\text{CO}}
.\]
  - Taking $\MCG^\pm_\Top(X)$ yields *homeomorphism up to homotopy*

- Similarly, we can do all of this in the smooth category:
\[  
\Diffeo(X) \da \Aut_{C^\infty}(X)
.\]
  - Taking $\MCG_{C^\infty}(X)$ yields *diffeomorphism up to isotopy*

- Similarly, we can do this for the homotopy category of spaces:
\[  
\text{ho}(X) \da \ts{[f] \in [X, Y]}
.\]
  - Taking $\MCG(X)$ here yields *homotopy classes of self-homotopy equivalences*.

## Relation to Moduli Spaces

- For topological manifolds: Isotopy classes of homeomorphisms
  - In the compact-open topology, two maps are isotopic iff they are in the same component of $\pi_0 \Aut(X)$.

- For surfaces:
  For $\Sigma$ a genus $g$ surface, $\MCG(S)$ acts on the Teichmuller space $T(S)$, yielding a SES
  \[  
  0 \to \MCG(\Sigma) \to T(\Sigma) \to {\mathcal{M}}_g \to 0 
  \]
  where the last term is the moduli space of Riemann surfaces homeomorphic to $X$.

- $T(S)$ is the moduli space of complex structures on $S$, up to the action of homeomorphisms that are isotopic to the identity:

  - Points are isomorphism classes of marked Riemann surfaces
  - Equivalently the space of hyperbolic metrics

- Used in the Neilsen-Thurston Classification: for a compact orientable surface, a self-homeomorphism is isotopic to one which is any of: 
  - Periodic,
  - Reducible (preserves some simple closed curves), or 
  - Pseudo-Anosov (has directions of expansion/contraction)

# Examples of MCG

## The Plane: Straight Lines

- $\MCG_\Top(\RR^2) = 1$: for any $f:\RR^2\to \RR^2$, take the straight-line homotopy:
\[  
F: \RR^2 \cross I &\to \RR^2 \\
F(x, t) &= tf(x) + (1-t)x
 .\]

 > Picture: parameterize line between $x$ and $f(x)$ and flow along it over time.


\newpage

## The Closed Disc: The Alexander Trick 

- $\MCG_\Top(\bar \DD^2) = 1$: for any $f: \bar\DD^2\to\bar\DD^2$ such that $\ro{f}{\bd \bar\DD^2} = \id$, take
\[  
F: \bar\DD^2 \cross I &\to \bar\DD^2 \\
F(x, t) &\da
\begin{cases}
t f \qty{x\over t} & \norm{x} \in [0, t) \\
x & \norm{x} \in [1-t, 1]
\end{cases}
.\]

  - This is an isotopy from $f$ to the identity.

  - Interpretation: "cone off" your homeomorphism over time:

  ![Image](figures/image_2020-09-30-01-33-46.png)

  - Note that this won't work in the smooth category: singularity at origin

\newpage

## Overview of Big Results 

- The word problem in $\MCG(\Sigma_g)$ is solvable

- Any finite group is $\MCG(X)$ for some compact hyperbolic 3-manifold $X$.

- For $g\geq 3$, the center of $\MCG(\Sigma_g)$ is trivial and $H_1(\MCG(\Sigma_g); \ZZ) = 1$

  - Why care: same as abelianization of the group.

:::{.theorem title="Dehn-Neilsen-Baer"}
Let $\Sigma_g$ be compact and oriented with $\chi(\Sigma_g) < 0$.
Then
\[  
\MCG^+_\del(\Sigma_g) \cong \Out_\del(\pi_1(\Sigma_g)) \cong_{\Grp} \pi_0 \mathrm{ho}_\del(\Sigma_g)
.\]
:::


- For $g\geq 4$, $H_2(\MCG(\Sigma_g); \ZZ) = \ZZ$

  - Why care: used to understand surface bundles

  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
  \Sigma_g \ar[r] & E \ar[d] \\
   & B  \\
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}

  - Find the classifying space $B\Diffeo$ 

  - Understand its homotopy type, since the homotopy LES yields 
  \[
  [S^n, B\Diffeo(\Sigma_g)] \cong [S^{n-1}, \Diffeo(\Sigma_g)]
  \]

  - Theorem (Earle-Ells): For $g\geq 2$, $\Diffeo_0(\Sigma_g)$ is contractible. 
  As a consequence, $\Diffeo(\Sigma_g) \surjects \Mod(\Sigma_g)$ is a homotopy equivalence, and there is a correspondence:
  \[  
  \correspond{\text{Oriented $\Sigma_g$ bundles} \\ \text{over } B }/\text{\tiny Bundle isomorphism}
  \iff
  \correspond{\text{Monodromy Representations} \\ \rho: \pi_1(B) \to \MCG(\Sigma_g)}/\text{\tiny Conjugacy}
  .\]

# Dehn Twists

- $\MCG(\Sigma_g)$ is generated by finitely many **Dehn twists**, and always has a finite presentation

:::{.claim}
Let $A \da \ts{z\in \CC \st 1\leq \abs z \leq 2}$, then $\MCG(A) \cong \ZZ$, generated by the map
\[  
\tau_0: \CC &\to \CC \\
z & \mapsto \exp{2\pi i \abs z}\, z
.\]

# MCG of the Torus

## Setup

:::{.definition title="Special Linear Group"}
\[  
\SL(n, \kk) = \ts{M\in \GL(n, \kk) \mid \det M = 1} = \ker \det_{\GG_m}
.\]
:::

:::{.definition title="Symplectic Group"}
\[  
\Sp(2n, \kk) = \ts{M\in \GL(2n, \kk) \mid M^t\Omega M = \Omega} \leq \SL(2n, \kk)
\]
where $\Omega$ is a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form on $\kk$.

Example:
\[  
\Omega = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & I_n \\
-I_n & 0
\end{bmatrix}
.\]
:::


:::{.definition title="Algebraic Intersection"}
A bilinear antisymmetric form on middle homology:
\[  
\hat{\iota}: H_1(\Sigma_g; \ZZ) \tensor H_1(\Sigma_g; \ZZ) \to \ZZ
.\]

> Note that this is a symplectic pairing.
:::

- There is a natural action of $\MCG(\Sigma)$ on $H_1(\Sigma; \ZZ)$, i.e. a *homology representation* of $\MCG(\Sigma)$:
\[  
\rho: \MCG(\Sigma) &\to \Aut_{\Grp}(H_1(\Sigma; \ZZ)) \\
f &\mapsto f_*
.\]


\newpage 

- For a surface of finite genus $g\geq 1$, elements in $\im \rho$ preserve the *algebraic intersection form*


![Jacob's Ladder and Loch Ness](figures/image_2020-09-28-00-55-25.png)

- Thus there is an interesting surjective representation:
\[  
0 \to \mathrm{Tor}(\Sigma_g) \injects \MCG(\Sigma_g) \surjects \Sp(2g; \ZZ) \to 0
.\]

- Kernel is the *Torelli group*, interesting because the symplectic group is well understood, so questions about $\MCG$ reduce to questions about $\Tor$.

:::{.theorem title="Mapping Class Group of the Torus"}
The homology representation of the torus induces an isomorphism
\[  
\sigma: \MCG(\Sigma_2) \mapsvia{\cong} \SL(2, \ZZ)
\]
:::



\newpage

## Proof



- For $f$ any automorphism, the induced map $f_*: \ZZ^2 \to \ZZ^2$ is a group automorphism, so we can consider the group morphism 
\[  
\tilde \sigma: (\Homeo(X,X), \circ) &\to (\GL(2, \ZZ), \circ) \\
f &\mapsto f_*
.\]

- This will descend to the quotient $\MCG(X)$ iff \[\Homeo^0(X, X) \subseteq \ker \tilde \sigma = \tilde\sigma\inv(\id)\]
  - This is true here, since any map in the identity component is homotopic to the identity, and homotopic maps induce the equal maps on homology.
- So we have a (now injective) map
\[  
\tilde \sigma:\MCG(X) &\to \GL(2, \ZZ)  \\
f &\mapsto f_*
.\]

\newpage

:::{.claim}
$\im(\tilde\sigma )\subseteq \SL(2, \ZZ)$.
:::

:::{.proof}
\hfill
- Algebraic intersection numbers in $\Sigma_2$ correspond to determinants
- $f\in \Homeo^+(X)$ preserve algebraic intersection numbers.
- See section 1.2 of Farb and Margalit
:::

- We can thus freely restrict the codomain to define the map
\[  
\sigma:\MCG(X) &\to \SL(2, \ZZ)  \\
f &\mapsto f_*
.\]

\newpage 

### Surjectivity

:::{.claim}
$\sigma$ is surjective.
:::
- $\RR^2$ is the universal cover of $\Sigma_2$, with deck transformation group $\ZZ^2$.

- Any $A\in \SL(2, \ZZ)$ extends to $\tilde A \in \GL(2, \RR)$, a linear self-homeomorphism of the plane that is orientation-preserving.


:::{.claim}
$\tilde A$ is equivariant wrt $\ZZ^2$
:::

:::{.proof}
\[  
\SL(2, \ZZ) = \gens{ S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
, T =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
}
.\]

Note that
\[  
S^2 = 1, \qquad 
T^n = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & n \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

So if $\vector x = \thevector{x_1, x_2} \in \ZZ \oplus \ZZ$ and $\tilde A\in \SL(2, \ZZ)$, we have $\tilde A\vector x \in \ZZ\oplus \ZZ$, i.e. $A$ preserves any integer lattice
\[  
\Lambda = \ts{p \vector v_1 + q\vector v_2 \st p, q\in \ZZ} 
.\]

:::

- So $\tilde A$ descends to a well-defined map 
\[  
\psi_{\tilde A}: \Sigma_2 \selfmap = \RR^2 / \ZZ^2 \selfmap
\]
 which is still a linear self-homeomorphism.


\newpage 

- There is a correspondence
\[  
\correspond{\text{Primitive curves in }  \\ \pi_1(\Sigma_2) \cong \ZZ^2} \iff 
\correspond{\text{Primitive vectors in }\ZZ^2}
\iff
\correspond{\text{Oriented simple closed} \\\text{curves in } \Sigma_2}/\text{\tiny homotopy}
,\]
 where an element $x$ is *primitive* iff it is not a multiple of another element.

  - By changing basis, you can associate a unique primitive vector to $M$ (all components coprime)

 - By the correspondence, changing a map by a homotopy corresponds to the same primitive vector

- Thus $\sigma([\psi_{\tilde A}]) = \tilde A$, and we have surjectivity.

\newpage 

### Injectivity 

:::{.claim}
$\sigma$ is injective.
:::

- Useful fact: $\Sigma_2 \simeq K(\ZZ^2, 1)$.

:::{.proposition title="Hatcher 1B.9"}
Let $X$ be a connected CW complex and $Y$ a $K(G, 1)$.
Then there is a map
\[  
\hom_\Grp(\pi_1(X; x_0), \pi_1(Y; y_0)) \to \hom_\Top((X; x_0), (Y; y_0))
,\]
i.e. every homomorphism of fundamental groups is induced by a continuous pointed map.


Moreover, the map is unique up to homotopies fixing $x_0$.
:::

- Thus there is a correspondence
\[  
\correspond{\text{Homotopy classes of } \\ \text{maps }\Sigma_2 \selfmap}
\iff
\correspond{\text{Group morphisms } \ZZ^2\selfmap}
.\]

- Claim: any element $f\in \MCG(\Sigma_2)$ has a representative $\phi$ which fixes any given basepoint

- So if $f\in \ker \sigma$, then $f\simeq \phi \simeq \id$ are homotopic, so $\ker \sigma = 1$.

# General

**Definition (Tangent Bundle):**
$TM = \disjoint_{p\in M} T_pM$, which fits into the vector bundle $\RR^n \to TM \to M$ so $T_p M \cong \RR^n$.

$T_p M = \spanof_\RR\theset{\partial x_i}$

**Definition (Cotangent Bundle):**
Since $T_p M$ is a vector space, we can consider its dual $T_p\dual M$, and similarly the cotangent bundle $\RR^n \to T\dual M \to M$.

$T_p\dual M = \spanof_\RR\theset{dx_i}$.

**Definition (Derivative of a Map):**
Recall that for any smooth function $H: M\to N$, the *derivative* of $H$ at $p\in M$ is defined by $dH_p: T_pM \to T_p N$ which we define using the derivation definition of tangent vectors: given a derivation $v\in T_p M: C^\infty(M) \to \RR$, we send it to the derivation $w_v \in T_{q}M = C^\infty(M) \to \RR$ where $w_v$ actson on $f\in C^\infty(M)$ by precomposition, i.e. $w_v \actson f = v(f \circ H)$.

![](2020-02-03-10-56-11.png)

**Definition: Fields and Forms**
A section of $TM$ is a vector field, and a section of $T\dual M$ is a 1-form.

More generally, differential $k\dash$forms are in $\Omega^k(M) \definedas \Gamma(\Lambda^k T\dual M)$, i.e. sections of exterior powers of the cotangent bundle.

**Definition (Closed and Exact Forms):**
Let $d_p: \Omega^p(M) \to \Omega^{p+1}(M)$ be the exterior derivative. 
Then a form $\omega$ is *closed* (or is a *cocycle*) iff $\omega \in \ker d_p$, and *exact* (or a *coboundary*) iff $\omega \in \im d_{p-1}$.

Note that closed forms are exact, since $d^2  = 0$, i.e. $\omega$ closed implies $\omega = d\lambda$ implies $d\omega = d^2 \lambda = 0$ implies $\omega$ is exact.

If $\alpha, \beta \in \Omega^p(M)$ with $\alpha-\beta$ exact, they are said to be *cohomologous*.

**Definition (Vector Field):**
A *vector field* $X$ on $M$ is a section of the tangent bundle $TM \mapsvia{\pi} M$.
Recall that these form an algebra $\mathfrak{X}(M)$ under the Lie bracket.

![](2020-02-03-20-52-40.png)

Note that vector fields can be *time-dependent* as a section of $T(M\cross I) \to M\cross I$.


**Definition (Regular Value):**
Let $H: M \to \RR$ be a smooth function, then $c\in \RR$ is a *regular value* iff for every $p\in H\inv(c)$, the induced map $H^*: T_pM \to T_P \RR$ is surjective.

**Definition (Closed Orbit):**
An *closed orbit* of a vector field $X$ on $M$ is an element in the loop space $\gamma \in \Omega M$ (equivalently a map $\gamma: S^1 \to M$) satisfying the ODE $\dd{\gamma}{t}(t) = X(\gamma(t))$.

> In words: the ODE says that the tangent vector at every point along the loop $\gamma$ should precisely be the tangent vector that the vector field $X$ prescribes at that point.

> Note: Every fixed point of $X$ is trivially a closed orbit.


**Definition (Flow):**
A *flow* is a group homomorphism $\RR \to \mathrm{Diff}(M)$ given by $t\mapsto \phi_t$.
Its integral curves are given by $\gamma_p: \RR \to M$ where $t\mapsto \phi_t(p)$.

> Remark: Note that $X(p) \in T_pM$ is a tangent vector at each point, so we can ask that $\dd{\phi_t}{t} (p) = X(\phi_t(p))$, i.e. that the tangent vectors to a flow are given by a vector field.
This works locally, and can be extended globally if $X$ is compactly supported.

**Definition (Interior Product):**
Let $M$ be a manifold and $X$ a vector field.
The interior product is a map
\begin{align*}
\iota_X: \Omega^{p+1}(M) 	&\to \Omega^p(M) 	&& & \\
\omega 										&	\mapsto \iota_X \omega: \Lambda^p TM \to \RR \\
& (X_1, \cdots, X_p) \to \omega (\vector X, X_1, \cdots, X_p)
.\end{align*}

> Note that this *contracts* a vector field with a differential form, coming from a natural pairing on $(i, j)$ tensors $V^{\tensor i}\tensor (V\dual)^{\tensor j}$.


**Definition (Lie Derivative):**

**General definition**: 
For an arbitrary tensor field $T$ (a section of some tensor bundle $V \to TM^{\tensor n} \to M$, example: Riemann curvature tensor, or any differential form) and a vector field $X$ (a section of the tangent bundle $W \to TM \to M$), we can define a "derivative" of $T$ along $X$.
Namely, 
$$
(\mathcal{L}_X T)_p = \left[\dd{}{t} \qty{(\phi_{-t})_* T_{\phi_t(p)}} \right]_{t=0}
$$ 
where

- $\phi_t$ is the 1-parameter group of diffeomorphisms induced by the flow induced by $X$,
- $(\wait)_*$ is the pushforward

> This measures how a tensor field changes as we flow it along a vector field.

![](2020-02-04-22-45-20.png)

**Specialized definition**:
If $\omega \in \Omega^{p+1}(M)$ is a differential form, we define 
$$
\mathcal{L}_x\omega = [d, \iota_x] \omega = d(\iota_x \omega) - \iota_x(d\omega)
$$ 
where $d$ is the exterior product.

> This is a consequence of "Cartan's Magic Formula", not the actual definition!

# Symplectic

**Definition (Symplectic Vector Field)**:
A vector field $X$ is symplectic iff $\mathcal{L}_X(\omega) = 0$.

> Remark: Then the flow $\phi_X$ preserves the symplectic structure.

**Definition (Hamiltonian Vector Field)**:
If $X$ is a vector field and $\iota_X \omega$ is both closed and exact, then $X$ is a *Hamiltonian vector field*.

**Definition**
Exact symplectic manifold $(M, \lambda)$, $\lambda \in \Omega^1(M)$, with $\omega = d\lambda$ for $\omega \in \Omega^2(M)$.

**Definition**
Liouville vector field $X$ is the solution of $\mcl_X \omega = \omega$, which yields $i_x d\lambda = \lambda$ where $i_x \omega(y) \definedas \omega(x, y)$.

# Contact

**Definition (Overtwisted Contact Structure):**
$(M, \xi)$ is *overtwisted* iff there exists an embedded disc $D^n \mapsvia{i} M$ such that $T(\bd D^n)_p \subset \xi_p$ pointwise for all $p \in \bd D^n$ and $TD^n_p$ is transverse to $\xi$ for every $p\in  (D^n)^\circ$.

# Handles

**Definition (Normal Bundle):**
Let $i: S \injects M$ be an embedding, and let $N_M(S)$ denote the *normal bundle* of $S$ in $M$, which fits into an exact sequence
\begin{align*}
0 \to TS \to i^* TM \to N_M(S) \to 0
,\end{align*}

where $i*TM$ is the pullback:

\begin{tikzcd}
i^* TS \arrow[dd, dashed] \arrow[rr, dashed] &  & TM \arrow[dd] \\
                                             &  &               \\
S \arrow[rr, "i"]                            &  & M            
\end{tikzcd}

so we can identify $N_M(S) \cong \restrictionof{TM}{i(S)}/TS$.

> Remark: We can "symplectify" this definition by requiring that the pullback of $\omega$ is constant rank.

**Definition (Tubular Neighborhood):**
For $S\injects M$ an embedded submanifold, a *tubular neighborhood* of $S$ is an embedding of the total space of a vector bundle $E \to S$ along with a smooth map $J: E \to M$ making the following diagram commute:

\begin{tikzcd}
E \arrow[rrdd, "J"] \arrow[dd, "\pi"]                  &  &   \\
                                                       &  &   \\
S \arrow[rr, "i"] \arrow[uu, "0_E", dashed, bend left] &  & M
\end{tikzcd}

where $0_E$ is the zero section.

# Summary

## Big Points 

- Homotopy as a means of classification somewhere between homeomorphism and cobordism
- Comparison to homology
- Higher homotopy groups of spheres exist
- Homotopy groups of spheres govern gluing of CW complexes
- CW complexes fully capture that homotopy category of spaces
- There are concrete topological constructions of many important algebraic operations at the level of spaces (quotients, tensor products)
- Relation to framed cobordism?
- "Measuring stick" for current tools, similar to special values of L-functions
- Serre's computation

## History

- 1860s-1890s: (Roughly) defined by Jordan for complex integration, "combinatorial topology"
  - Original motivation: when does a path integral depend on a specific path? (E.g. a contour integral in $\CC$)
- 1895: Poincare, *Analysis situs* ("the analysis of position") in analogy to Euler *Geometria situs* in 1865 on the Kongisberg bridge problem
    Attempts to study spaces arising from gluing polygons, polyhedra, etc (surfaces!), first use of "algebraic invariant theory" for spaces by introducing $\pi_1$ and homology.
- 1920s: Rigorous proof of classification of surfaces (Klein, Möbius, Clifford, Dehn, Heegard), captured entirely by $\pi_1$ (equivalently, by genus and orientability).
- 1925-1928: Noether, Mayer, Vietoris develop general algebraic theory of homology, now "algebraic topology"
- 1931: Hopf discovers a nontrivial (not homotopic to identity) map $S^3 \to S^2$
  - Compare to homology: $H^k S^n = 0$ for $k\geq n$ is an easy theorem!
- 1932/1935: Cech (resp Hurewicz) introduce higher homotopy groups, gives a map relating homotopy to homology, shows they are abelian groups for $n\geq 2$.
  - Withdrew his paper because of this theorem!
- 1937: Freudenthal suspension theorem, investigation into "stable" phenomena.
- 1938: Pontrayagin shows link between homotopy groups of spheres and framed cobordism classes of submanifolds of $S^n$.
  - Direction of computation: using cobordism classes (geometric) to compute $\pi_k S^n$. Modern day: run the computation backwards to compute cobordism groups.
- 1940: Eilenberg, obstruction theory
- 1949: Whitehead introduces homotopy types, CW complexes, equivalences = weak equivalences. Importance of homotopy classes of maps between spheres becomes apparent
- 1951: Serre uses spectral sequences to show that *all* groups $\pi_k S^n$ are torsion except $k=n$, and $k\equiv 3\mod 4, n\equiv 0 \mod 2$.
  - In first case, $\ZZ$, in second case, $\ZZ \oplus T$ for some torsion group.
  - Tight bounds on where $p\dash$torsion can occur.
- 1953: Whitehead shows the homotopy groups of spheres split into stable and unstable ranges. 
- Today: We know $\pi_{n+k}S^n$ for 
  - $k \leq 64$ when $n\geq k+2$ (stable range)
  - $k \leq 19$ when $n < k+2$ (unstable range) 
  - We *only* have a complete list for $S^0$ and $S^1$, and know *no* patterns beyond this!

## Actual Outline

- Definitions of spheres and balls
- Definition of homotopy of maps
  - Motivations from complex analysis
- Functoriality 
- Examples of spaces that are homotopy equivalent and *aren't*.
- Example where homotopy distinguishes homologically equivalent spaces

## Theorems and Definitions

A map $f: X \to Y$ is called a *weak homotopy equivalence* if the induced maps $f^*_i: \pi_i(X, x_0) \to \pi_i(Y, f(x_0))$ are isomorphisms for every $i \geq 0$.
If a map $X \mapsvia{f} Y$ satisfies $f(X^{(n)}) \subseteq Y^{(n)}$, then $f$ is said to be a *cellular map*.
Any map $X \mapsvia{f} Y$ between CW complexes is homotopic to a cellular map.
For every topological space $X$, there exists a CW complex $Y$ and a weak homotopy equivalence $f: X \to Y$. Moreover, if $X$ is $n\dash$dimensional, $Y$ may be chosen to be $n\dash$connected and is obtained from $X$ by attaching cells of dimension greater than $n$.
**Abbreviated statement**: if $X, Y$ are CW complexes, then any map $f: X \to Y$ is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if it is a homotopy equivalence.
(Note: $f$ must induce maps on all homotopy groups simultaneously.)
If $X$ is an $n\dash$ connected CW complex, then there are maps $\pi_i X \to \pi_{i+1} \Sigma X$ which is an isomorphism for $i\leq 2n$ and a surjection for $i=2n+1$.

- Theorem: $\pi_1 S^1 = \ZZ$
  - *Proof*: Covering space theory

- Theorem: $\pi_{1+k} S^1 = 0$ for all $0 < k < \infty$

- Theorem: $\pi_1 S^n = 0$ for $n \geq 2$.
  - $S^n$ is simply connected.

- Theorem: $\pi_n S^n = \ZZ$

## Talk 1: Knot Floer Homology and Cosmetic Surgeries

Dehn surgery: fundamental procedure for building 3-manifolds.

Outline

- Background on problem
- Results (known and new)
- Tools
- Proof


### Basics

Let $K\injects S^3$ be a knot.
Pick a rational number $p/q$ or $\infty$.
Can perform $p/q\dash$surgery (i.e. Dehn surgery) to obtain $S_{p/q}^3(K) \definedas (S^3\setminus K) \disjoint_f (D^2 \cross S^1)$ where $\bd D^2 \cross \pt \mapsto -p\mu + q\lambda$ where $\mu = ?, \lambda$ is the Seifert fiber (?).

Is this a unique operation?
I.e. do different knots yield different 3-manifolds?

Question:
Can different surgeries on the same knot yield different 3-manifolds?

**Definition:**
Two surgeries are *purely cosmetic* iff there is an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism between them.
If there is an orientation *reversing* diffeomorphism, they are said to be chirally cosmetic.

**Conjecture:**
There are no purely cosmetic surgeries.

Remark:
The conjecture can be stated for $K \injects Y^3$

> Note: don't know what $Y^3$ is.

Remark:
There exist chirally cosmetic surgeries.

Example:
$+9$ and $+\frac 9 2$ surgery on $T_{2, 3}$, or $+r, -r$ on any ampichiral knot.

Remark:
Meant to generalize the "knot complement problem", i.e. are knots determined by their complements?

Theorem (Gordon-Luecke 89):
If $S_r^3(K) = S^3 = S_\infty^3(K)$, then $r=\infty$.
(I.e. the only trivial surgery really is the trivial surgery?)

### Known Results

Suppose $K\subset S^3$is nontrivial, and two Dehn surgeries with different slopes are diffeomorphic.

- Computing $H^1 = \ZZ_p$ forces $p=p'$.
- By Boyer-Lines '91, the Alexander polynomial satisfies $\Delta_k''(1) = 0$.
- By Osvath-Szabo-Wu ('05, '09), $q$ and $q'$ have opposite signs (not necessarily $q=-q'$).
  - So there at most two ways of getting the same manifold from cosmetic surgeries.
- By Wang '06, $g\neq 1$
- By Ni-Wu '10, $\tau(K) = 0, q' = -q$, and $q^2 = -1 \mod p$.

**Theorem:**
Let $q > 0$, so $q' < 0$.
Then

- $p = 1, 2$
- If $p=2$, then $q = 1$ and $g=2$.
- If $p=1$, then $q \leq \frac{t+2g}{2g(g-1)}$

where $g$ is the genus and $t$ is the *Heegard-Floer thickness*.

Moreover, the knot Floer homology satisfies some further conditions (stronger than e.g. $\tau(K) = 0$).


Note that if $t < 4$, then the last condition forces $q=1, g=2$.
We then only have to consider two slopes.

Corollary:
The corollary holds for *thin knots* (i.e. thickness zero), e.g. all alternating and quasialternating knots.

For knots up to 16 crossings, $t\leq 2$ (from computations of knot-Floer homology on 1.6 million knots?)
When $K$ is thin, this condition can be stated in terms of the Alexander polynomial.

**Theorem:**
If $K$ is thin and has purely cosmetic surgery, then

- $g(K) = 2$
- The slopes are $\pm 1, \pm 2$
- The coefficients of the Alexander polynomial occur in ratios: $\Delta_k(t) = nt^2 - 4nt + (6n+1) - 4nt\inv  + nt^{-2}$ for some $n$, 

This is computationally effective:

- Number of prime knots with at most 16 crossings: 1.7 million
- Number with $\tau = 0$: 450,000
- Number satisfying the conditions in the theorem: 337

For each of these, need to consider $\pm 1, \pm 2$.
Noting from $HF$ will distinguish these surgeries.
Can use SnapPea to compute hyperbolic invariants -- most are distinguished by hyperbolic volume, or Chern-Simons invariant.

Could potentially take connect sums of the above knots, but eventually they stop satisfying the necessary condition.
In fact, the conjecture holds if all prime summands of $K$ have less than 16 crossings.

**Theorem (Ichihara-Song-Mattman-Saito):**
The conjecture holds for all 2-bridge knots.

**Theorem (Tao):**
Conjecture holds for arbitrary connected sums.

> So if there is a knot with cosmetic surgery, it is not prime.

Remark:
Futer-Purcell-Schleimer independently proved a similar result using hyperbolic techniques.


### Tools

What we'll want

1. Need some 3-manifold invariant to distinguish different surgeries
2. A knot invariant
3. A surgery formula computing (1) from (2) and the slope $p, q$.

Previously used 

- Cassem-Gordon and Cassem-Walker invariants, and
- Alexander polynomial ($\implies \Delta''(1) = 0$)

For (1), we'll use Heegard-Floer homology for the 3-manifold invariant:
Associated to a closed oriented 3-manifold $Y$ a graded vector space $\widehat{HF}(Y)$. 
In our case, it will be over $\ZZ/(2)$, and splits over $\mathrm{Spin}^c$ structures as $\widehat{HF}(Y) = \bigoplus_{s\in \mathrm{Spin}^c(Y)} \widehat{HF}(Y; s)$.

> Note that $\mathrm{Spin}^c(Y)$ can be put in correspondence with $H^1(Y)$.

For (2), we'll use knot Floer homology, namely a reformulation following H-Rasmussen-Watson.
To a knot $K \subset S^3$, associate

- An immersed collection of closed curves $\Gamma = (\gamma_0, \cdots, \gamma_n)$ in the punctured torus $T$:
  - I.e. a graded immersed Lagrangian
  - Defined up to homotopy equivalence, where homotopies can't cross the puncture.

  ![Image](figures/2020-01-13-15:14.png)\

- Some grading data ($\times 2$, Alexander and Maslov) amounting to labeling each component of $\Gamma$ with an integer. 
  (Important to proof!)

- (From world of immersed Lagrangians) A bounding cochain, i.e. a subset of self-intersection points of $\Gamma$.

Interpret the Alexander grading as specifying a lift $\bar \Gamma$  of $\Gamma$ from $T$ to $\bar T$, a $\ZZ\dash$fold covering space of $T$:

![Image](figures/2020-01-13-15:22.png)\

Examples (These are curves wrapped around cylinders):

![The unknot](figures/2020-01-13-15:25.png)

![$T_{2,3}$](figures/2020-01-13-15:24.png)

![Figure 8](figures/2020-01-13-15:25.png)

![$C_{2,1}(T_{2, 3})](figures/2020-01-13-15:27.png)

![$9_{44}$](figures/2020-01-13-15:28.png)

Somehow, this last example is representative.

A surgery formula: $\widehat{HF}(S_{p/q}^3(K))$ is floer homology in $T$ of $\Gamma$ with $\ell_{p,q}$ a line of slope $p/q$, i.e. it is generated by minimal intersection points $\Gamma \intersect \ell_{p, q}$. 
(This gives a chain complex, count bi-gons.)

For the $\mathrm{spin}^c$ decomposition, look at $\bar T$ with different lifts of $\ell_{p, q}$.









## Talk 2: Branched Covers Bounding $\QQ H B^4$

> Joint work with Aceto, Meier, A. Miller, M. Miller, Stipsicz.

**Definition:**
Two knots $K_0, K_1$ are **concordant** iff they cobound an annulus, i.e. there exists a smooth cylinder $S^1 \cross I$ embedded in $S^3 \cross I$ such that $S^1 \cross\theset{i}$ in $S^3 \cross \theset{i}$ is $K_i$.

The concordance group is an abelian group defined by $C = \theset{\text{knots in } S^3}/\sim$ where we identify knots that are concordant.

Theorem (Fox-Milnor 66):
If $K$ is slice, then $\Delta_K(t) = f(t) f(t\inv ) \in \ZZ[t^{\pm 1}]$.

Remark:
Define $A(k) \definedas H_1(\tilde{ S^3\setminus K}, \ZZ)$ as the integral homology of the infinite cyclic cover as a $\ZZ[t^{\pm 1}]\dash$module.
This is equal to $H_1(S^3\setminus K; \ZZ[t^{\pm 1}])$.
Then $\Delta_k(t) \definedas \mathrm{ord}(A(k))$.
Given an element of $M_{n, m}$ we get $\ZZ[t^{\pm 1}]^m \to \ZZ[t^{\pm 1}]^n \to A(k) \to 0$.
We can consider the ideal generated by all the minors (the order ideal), and if this ideal is principal we call the generator $\Delta_k(t)$.

$V - tV^t$ (the Seifert matrix?) is a square presentation matrix for $A(k)$, so $\Delta_k(t) = \det(V - tV^t)$.
Note that this is easy to compute. 
Example: for the figure 8, $\Delta_{4, 1}(t) = \det([1-t, t; -1, -1+t]) = -t^2 + 3t - 1$.

There is a notion of algebraically slice, and an algebraically slice knot implies Fox-Milnor.

Theorem (Casson-Gordon, 78):
If $K$ is slice and $p$ prime then the $p^r\dash$fold branched cover $\Sigma_{p^r}(K)$ is a rational homology 3-sphere $\QQ H S^3$ and bounds a rational homology 4-ball $\QQ HB^4$.

Remark:
$\Sigma_{p^r}(K_1 \# K_2) = \Sigma_{p^r} K_1 \# \Sigma_{p^r} K_2$.
The following map measures the obstruction to being slice: $\beta_{p^r}: \rho \to \Theta^3_\QQ$, where $[K] \to [\Sigma_{p^r} K]$.

Question:
How good is $\beta_{p^r}$ as a slice obstruction?

$\beta_2$ is pretty good for 2-bridge knots, i.e.

Theorem (Lisca 07):
If $K$ is a connected sum of 2-bridge knots, then $\beta_2(K) = 0 \implies K$ is slice.

> Note: there are non-slice knots with $\beta_2 =0$.

Theorem (Casson-Haner 81):
For each $s>0$, $\Sigma(2, 2s-1, 2s+1) \cong \Sigma_2(T_{2s-1, 2s+1})$ bounds a contractible manifold.

Theorem (Litherland 78):
Torus knots are $L_\delta I_0$ in $\rho$. (??)

These together imply that $\ker \beta_2 \geq \ZZ^\infty$.

Theorem (Aceto-Larson 18):
$\ker \beta_2 \cong \ZZ^\infty \oplus G$.

Main Theorem:
$\intersect_{p \text{ prime }, r\in \NN} \ker \beta_{p^r} \geq (\ZZ/(2))^4$.

> Knots in here have arf invariant zero, and are torsion in the concordance group.

#### Step 1: Construction

Define $K_n \definedas (\sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2\inv)^n$ for $\sigma_i$ in the braid group $B_3$.

Example:

![Image](figures/2020-01-13-16:28.png)\

Definition:
$K$ is strongly negative ampichiral if there exists an orientation reversing involution $\tau:S^3 \to S^3$ such that $\tau(K) = K$.

Lemma (Kawauchi 09):
If $K$ is strongly negative ampichiral, then
$K$ bounds a disc in a $X = \QQ H B^4$ with only 2-torsion in $H_1(X; \ZZ)$.

*Proof (sketch):*
Let $M_k = S_0^3(K)$ be zero surgery on the knot.

![Image](figures/2020-01-13-16:34.png)

Then $\tau: M_k \to M_k$ is fixed-point free.

Can then consider the map $\pi: M_k \to M_k/\tau$ and the associated twisted $I\dash$bundle $I \to Z \to M_k \to M_k/\tau$.
Then:

![Image](figures/2020-01-13-16:37.png)

Theorem:
If $K$ is slice, the $\Sigma_{p^r}(K)$ bounds a $\QQ H B^4$ if $p$ is prime.

Proof (Milnor 68).

There is an exact sequence

\begin{align*}
\tilde H_i(\tilde X; \ZZ_p) \mapsvia{t^{p^r} - \id} \tilde H_i(\tilde X; \ZZ_p) \to \tilde H(\Sigma_{p^r}(D); \ZZ_p) (= 0) \to 0 \\
\tilde H_i(\tilde X; \ZZ_p) \mapsvia{t - \id} \tilde H_i(\tilde X; \ZZ_p) \to \tilde H(B^4; \ZZ_p) (= 0) \to 0 
,\end{align*}

where if $t-\id$ is an isomorphism, $(t^{p^r} - \id) = (t-\id)^{p^r}$ is an isomorphism as well (note we're in $\ZZ_p$.)

Corollary:
If $p$ is an odd prime, then $\Sigma_{p^r}(K)$ bounds a $\QQ H B^4$.

![Image](figures/2020-01-13-16:44.png)

Thus $\Sigma_{2^r}(K_n) \cong \Sigma_n(K_{2^r})$ by this symmetry.

In conclusion, if $n$ is an odd prime power, then $K_n \in \intersect \ker \beta_{p^r}$.

#### Step 2: Obstruction

Theorem (Brandenbursky 16):
$K_n$ is algebraically slice iff $n$ odd.

Uses a twisted Alexander polynomial:
Take $M_k = S_0^3(K)$ a zero surgery, $G = \pi_1(M_k)$, and $A(k) = G^{(1)}/G^{(2)}$ (?).

The input is a map $X: H_1(\Sigma_{p^r}(K); \ZZ) \to \ZZ_q$.
This lets you define a character 

\begin{align*}
\alpha(X): G \to G/G^{(1)} \cong \ZZ \semidirect A(k) 
\to \ZZ\semidirect A(t) / t^{p^r} - \id 
\cong \ZZ \semidirect H_1(\Sigma_{p^r}(K))
\to \GL(K, \QQ(\zeta_q)[t^{\pm 1}] )
.\end{align*}

Then $\tilde M_k$ is the universal cover of $M_k$.
Consider $C_*(\tilde M_k) \tensor{\ZZ[G]} Y$ for $Y = (\QQ(\zeta_q)[t^{\pm 1}] )^k$, then define the twisted Alexander polynomial $\Delta_k^{\tilde X}(t) = \mathrm{ord}(H_1(M_k, Y))$.

Theorem:
If $K$ is slice, then there exists some $X$ such that $\delta_K^{\tilde X}(t) = f(t) f(t\inv)$ in $\QQ(\zeta_q)[t^{\pm 1}]$.

Open question:
Are there infinite order elements in this group?

# Hyperplane Fields

These are important because of their ties to *foliations*.

*Example 1 of a Hyperplane Fields:*
Take $M=S^2$, so we have $\RR^2 \to TS^2 \to S^2$.
The tangent spaces are planes, and codimension 1 spaces are lines:

![](2020-02-01-23-22-51.png)

*Example 2 of a Hyperplane Fields:*
Let $M = \RR^3$ so $TM \cong \RR^3$. 
Write $T_pM = \spanof_\RR\theset{\partial x_1, \partial x_2, \partial x_3}$ and $T_p\dual M = \spanof_\RR\theset{dx_1, dx_2, dx_3}$ locally and define $\xi$ by the condition $$dx_3 = 0$$

![](2020-02-01-22-28-35.png)

> Idea: no movement in the $x_3$ direction, constrained to move only in $x_1, x_2$ directions. Assigns a "horizontal" hyperplane to each point in $\RR^3$.


> Remark: This is the kernel of a tangent covector at every point, i.e. a 1-form. This is a prototypical feature.

*Example 3 of a Hyperplane Fields:*
For $M=\RR^3$, write $T\dual \RR^3 = \spanof_\RR\theset{dx, dy, dz}$, and take $$\omega = dz + xdy \in \Omega^1(\RR^3)$$
This is the "standard contact structure" on $\RR^3$, and assigns hyperplanes that look like this:

![](2020-02-01-22-34-56.png)

> Remark:
> Note that this has a more twisted structure, which is what geometrically makes it contact -- no embedded (hyper) surface in $\RR^3$ can have an open subset $U$ such that $\xi$ is tangent to $p$ for every $p\in U$.

# Foliations

> *Remark:*
> Foliations arise when you have a PDE (IVP or BVP) defined on an $n\dash$manifold $M$, with some initial/boundary conditions defined on an embedded surface, and you want to find the time evolution of that system (moving you through leaves of the foliation, think of spacetime being foliated by space-like hyperplanes in General Relativity).

**Definition (Foliation):**
A *foliation* on $M$ is a hyperplane field $\xi$ satisfying one of two equivalent conditions:

1. A family of embedded surfaces $\Sigma_i \injects M$ such that $M = \disjoint_i \Sigma_i$ uniquely.
2. $\xi$ is locally diffeomorphic to the horizontal hyperplane field $dx_n = 0$.

> Note: the foliation is usually referred to by the collection $\Sigma_i$.
> Can also think of this as a smooth manifold where transition maps "preserve hyperplanes", i.e. they are functions of only one variable.

The "slices" given by the surfaces are referred to as *leaves*.

*Example of a Foliation:*
As in example 2, take $\RR^3 = \disjoint_{t\in \RR} ~t + H_{xy}$ where $H_{xy} = \theset{(x,y,z) \in \RR^3 \suchthat z=0}$ is the $xy\dash$plane and $t+ H_{xy} = \theset{(x,y,z) \in \RR^3 \suchthat t = z}$ are the vertical translates.
This yields a foliation of $\RR^3$ by planes.

*Example of a Foliation:*
Any fiber bundle $F \to E \mapsvia{\pi} B$ is foliated by leaves $L_b \definedas \theset{b} \cross \pi\inv(b)$.

*Example of a Foliation*:
Let $T = \RR^2/\ZZ^2$ be a flat torus and $q$ any irrational number; then lines $L_q$ of slope $q$ foliate $T$.

*Example of a Foliation:*
Any nonsingular vector field $X$ on a closed manifold $M$ defines a foliation; each leaf is the orbit of a point under the flow of $X$.

*Example of a Foliation:*
Take $M$ closed, $G$ a connected Lie group acting locally freely (the stabilizer of a point is a discrete subgroup of $G$). Then again $M$ is foliated by orbits of points.

*Example (The Reeb Foliation):*
Define a map out of a cylinder in cylindrical coordinates
\begin{align*}
f: (D^2)^\circ \cross \RR &\to \RR \\
(\vector x, t) &\mapsto e^{\frac{1}{1-\abs z}} - t
.\end{align*}

Adding in a component $\bd D^2 \cross \RR \cong S^1 \cross \RR$ yields a foliation of $D^2 \cross \RR$.
Then take a $\ZZ\dash$action where $z\actson (\vector x, t) = (\vector x, t+z)$; modding out by this action yields a solid torus, which still has the above foliation.

Do this to twice, gluing the two tori along their boundary to construct a copy of $S^3$, yields a foliation of $S^3$ where each leaf $L_b$ is not Hausdorff.


*Remark:*
A foliation $\theset{\Sigma_i}$ induces a decomposition on the tangent bundle of $M$, namely $TM = T(\Sigma_i) \oplus \xi$ (? check) where $\xi$ is a line bundle everywhere transverse to the $\Sigma_i$. 
In this situation, we say $\theset{\Sigma_i}$ is *transversely orientable*.
Whenever $\theset{\Sigma_i}$ is transversely orientable, it can be associated uniquely to a nonsingular 1-form $\omega$.
Then given an $f: M\to \RR^2$ (check dimension), we can study the set of critical points $S = \theset{p\in M \suchthat \omega_p \wedge df_p = 0}$.

*Remark:*
A specific type of foliation that comes up in modern research are *taut* foliations, which are codimension 1 foliations $\mathcal{F} = \theset{L_b}$ for which for every leaf $L_b$ there is a closed loop $\gamma: S^1 \to M$ intersecting $L_b$ with $\gamma$ everywhere transverse to $\mathcal{F}$.

**Theorem:**
TFAE:

1. $\mathcal{F}$ is a taut foliation.
2. There is a flow transverse to $\mathcal{F}$ that preserves some volume form on $M$.
3. There is a Riemannian metric on $M$ for which each leaf $L_b$ is a least-area hypersurface.

# Witt Vectors

General idea: given a commutative ring $R$, a Witt vector $w$ will be an infinite sequence of elements of $R$. Taking $W(R)$ to be a collection of such $w$, we will equip $W(R)$ with its own ring structure.

One useful fact will be that $W(\FF_p) = \ZZ_p$, the ring of $p\dash$adic integers. The construction essentially mirrors a way of obtaining $\ZZ_p$ from the finite field $\FF_p$.

> Quick review: the $p\dash$adic integers are metric space completions of $\ZZ$ that are not $\QQ$. Two numbers are "close" in the $p\dash$adic metric exactly when they differ by a large power of $p$.

The initial application of Witt vectors comes from the problem of finding "nice" expressions for the sums and products of $p\dash$adic integers. In general, if $x\in \ZZ_p$, one can write $x = \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i p^i$ with $a_i \in \FF_p$, which is a convergent power series in the $p\dash$adic metric. 

One can thus represent $x$ an element of $\prod_{i=1}^\infty \FF_p$, where we just need to find the appropriate ring structure. However, this particular representation proves difficult to compute with. As it turns out, an alternative choice that works well is taking coefficients from a particular subset of $\ZZ_p$.

There is a map called the *Teichmüller character*, 

$$
\omega: \FF_p^\times \to \ZZ_p^\times,
$$

and so another choice of $a_i$ can be obtained by looking at 
$$
U \definedas \theset{x \in \ZZ_p \suchthat x^{p}-x=0},
$$ 
the $(p-1)\dash$th roots of unity in $\ZZ_p$. This arises from the fact that $\FF_p^\times \cong \ZZ/(p-1)\ZZ$, and so every nonzero element of $\FF_p$ is a root of $x^{p-1}-1$. Using Hensel's lemma, these lift to representatives in $\ZZ_p$ satisfying the same equation.

If we then let $a_i \in U \union \theset{0}$; we can pull $U$ back along $\omega$ to map the latter choices of $a_i$ to the former, so this yields an alternative representation of $x$. These characters can be computed explicitly in the forward direction: to find $x =[x_1, x_2, \cdots ]$ on the Teichmüller side, one simply computes $x_i$ recursively via the conditions $$x_0 = x \\ x_i = x_{i-1} \mod p^i,\\ x_i^{p-1}-1=0 \mod p^{i+1}.$$

Now instead of looking at infinite sequences of elements of $\FF_p$, we can look at infinite sequences of elements in $\omega(\FF_p) \subseteq \ZZ_{p}$, and Witt vectors allow us to explicitly compute with such things.

One can find explicit expression for the sums and products of such things, and it turns out these are "functorial enough" to be generalized to arbitrary rings. In general, one can produce $W(R)$, the big Witt ring with coefficients in $R$, by first defining a *divisor-stable set* $P$, which satisfy $n\in P \implies $ all proper divisors of $n$ are in $P$. Examples includes $P=\theset{1,2,\cdots n}$ and $P = \theset{1,p,p^2, \cdots}$.

One then defines 
$$
W_P(R) = R^P \definedas \prod_{i\in P} R ,
$$ 

and $W(R) = W_\NN(R)$.

A final important part of the definition are the *Witt polynomials*
$$
w_n: W_P(R) \to R \\
w _ { n } = \sum _ { d | n } d x _ { d } ^ { n / d } \in \ZZ \left[ \left\{ x_ { d } \suchthat d \divides n \right\} \right],
$$

which, if we write $x = [x_i]_{i\in P}$ (the *Witt components of $x$*), yields a map
$$
w_\wait :W_P(R) \to R^P \\
x \mapsto [w_i(x)]_{i\in P}
$$

where the $w_i(x)$ are referred to as the *ghost components* of $x$.

Given all of this, for any such $P$, we obtain a covariant endofunctor on $\ZZ\dash$algebras. $\qed$

A *formal group law* is an intermediate notion between a Lie group and a Lie algebra, being slightly more general than a Lie algebra, which has a product operation that can be represented entirely in terms of formal power series.

To flesh this out, note that a common fact from Lie theory is that there is an equivalence of categories
$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{c} \text{simply connected} \\ \text{real Lie groups} \end{array} \right\} \iff \left\{ \text{real Lie algebras} \right\}.
% ToDo: make a macro for this
$$

Taking the lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ of a lie group $G$ is viewed as a "linearization" of $G$, and amounts to studying $G$ in some neighborhood of the identity. We'd like to translate this to the setting of algebraic groups, but this process fails in characteristic $p$ and results in too much loss of information.

So we instead look for an *intermediate* structure $\mathcal F$ that is somehow between a lie group and its lie algebra; schematically,
$$
G \to \mathcal F \to \mathfrak g,
$$

and a formal group is such an $\mathcal F$ that ends up retaining enough information to work.

The analog of studying $G$ near the identity $e$ is taking the completion of $G$, given by 
$$
\widehat G \definedas \spec (\widehat{\mathcal O_{G, e}}),
$$

where $\mathcal O_{G,e}$ is the stalk at the identity. This object turns out to be a group scheme which captures information about $G$ locally near $e$, and is both captures enough information to be useful and is easy enough to study.

Thus a formal group is a natural setting in which to study objects like $\widehat G$.

Formal groups appear in Topology when considering "complex oriented cohomology theories" evaluated on $\CP^\infty$, and in particular in complex cobordism cohomology. They are also useful in class field theory to construct something called the "local Artin map". In characteristic zero, every formal group is completely determined by a corresponding Lie algebra. Moreover, a formal group is a group object in the category of formal schemes.

In Lie groups, once we choose coordinates around the identity, the multiplication on the Lie group can be expressed using power series. This procedure gives us a formal group law. 

Given a lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ over a field $k$, a *deformation* of $\mathfrak g$ is another lie algebra $\mathfrak a$ over a $k\dash$algebra $A$, along with an isomorphism
$$
\phi: \mathfrak g \to \mathfrak a \tensor_A k
$$

In general, the deformation theory of an object provides a way of studying the smoothness of the moduli space of such objects.

# Why study $K$-theory?
Examples of results gleaned from the K-theory approach include the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem, Bott periodicity, the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, and the Adams operations.

It played a major role in the second proof of the Index Theorem (circa 1962).

Already in 1955, Jean-Pierre Serre had used the analogy of vector bundles with projective modules to formulate Serre's conjecture, which states that every finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring is free;

Geometrically, finitely generated projective modules correspond to vector bundles over affine space, and free modules to trivial vector bundles. Affine space is topologically contractible, so It admits no non-trivial topological vector bundles. It also admits no non-trivial holomorphic vector bundles. Jean-Pierre Serre remarked that the corresponding question was not known for algebraic vector bundles: "It is not known whether there exist projective A-modules of finite type which are not free." Here $A$ is a polynomial ring over a field, that is, $A$ = $k[x_1, ..., x_n]$. Theorem: every finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring is free.

Note: another example of the use of the correspondence between isomorphism classes and cohomology

The Picard group of a ringed space X, denoted by Pic(X), is the group of isomorphism classes of invertible sheaves (or line bundles) on X. Alternatively, the Picard group can be defined as the sheaf cohomology group $H^{1} (X,{\mathcal {O}}_{X}^{*})$.

# Why study cobordism?

Cobordism is a much coarser equivalence relation than diffeomorphism or homeomorphism of manifolds, and is significantly easier to study and compute. It is not possible to classify manifolds up to diffeomorphism or homeomorphism in dimensions ≥ 4 – because the word problem for groups cannot be solved – but it is possible to classify manifolds up to cobordism.

It performed an important role, historically speaking, in developments in topology in the 1950s and early 1960s, in particular in the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, and in the first proofs of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem.

Every vector bundle theory (real, complex etc.) has an extraordinary cohomology theory called K-theory

# Why study characteristic classes?

> A characteristic class is a way of associating to each principal bundle X a cohomology class of X. The cohomology class measures the extent the bundle is "twisted" — and whether it possesses sections.

> Characteristic numbers solve the oriented and unoriented bordism questions: two manifolds are (respectively oriented or unoriented) cobordant if and only if their characteristic numbers are equal.

> When the theory was put on an organised basis around 1950 (with the definitions reduced to homotopy theory) it became clear that the most fundamental characteristic classes known at that time (the Stiefel–Whitney class, the Chern class, and the Pontryagin classes) were reflections of the classical linear groups and their maximal torus structure.

# The Big Motivating Problems

- The Kervaire Invariant 1 problem
- Classifying manifolds up to framed cobordism
- Distinct smooth structures on spheres

# Motivation: Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres

If one understood even the stable homotopy groups of spheres very well, one would therefore have a near complete understanding of the group of smooth structures on the $n\dash$-sphere for $n\neq 4$.

The homotopy group $π_{n+k}(S^k)$ is a finite group except

1. for $n=0$ in which case $π_k(S^k)=\ZZ$;

2. $k=2m$ and $n=2m−1$ in which case $π_{4m−1}(S^{2m})≃Z⊕F_m$
for $F_m$ a finite group.

## What is the $J$ homomorphism? 

The $J$ homomorphism seems to link the framed bordism classes of manifolds to homotopy groups of spheres - for example $J$ takes $\pi_k(SL^n(R))$ to $\pi_{n}^k S^n$.

Look at the map
\[
\begin{align*}
SO(n) &\to \Omega^n S^n\\
A: (\RR^n \to \RR^n) &\mapsto A^+
.\end{align*}
\]

Where we view a matrix as a linear function on $\RR^n$, and take it to its compactification which is a map $S^n\to S^n$. Taking the limit yields a map from $SO^\infty \to QS^0 = \ \Omega^\infty \Sigma^\infty S^0$, and taking $\pi_0$ of both sides induces the $J$ homomorphism. The RHS is equal to $\pi_*^s$, the stable homotopy groups of spheres.
But the homotopy groups of $SO$ were computed by Bott, and have some 8-fold periodicity.

The image of $J$ was found by Adams in '66 or so, it is a finite group with order the denominator of some function involving Bernoulli numbers. However, the pattern is more apparent by looking at the $p$-stems, then the number of connected dots really just depends on the $p$-adic divisibilty of the horizontal number plus 1. The image of $J$ is just the bottom row in these stem diagrams.

## How to read the stem diagrams

Each one is for a fixed $p$, for example at $p=2$ each dot depicts a factor of 2 and vertical lines denote additive extensions. For example, $\cdot \to \cdot \to \cdot$ vertically would denote $\ZZ_{2^3} = \ZZ_2 \oplus \ZZ_2 \oplus \ZZ_2$, whereas $\cdot \to \cdot$ denotes $\ZZ_2 \oplus \ZZ_2$.

The EHP sequence is good for unstable stuff, not the best for stable - use the Adams spectral sequence instead.

The stable homotopy groups of spheres are isomorphic to the framed cobordism groups of manifolds. The Kervaire invariant has to do with which stable homotopy groups can be represented by exotic spheres. There are several open problems related to differentials and invariants the arise from this SS, e.g. what are the permanent cycles? The Kervaire Invariant Problem was only recently solved by Hopkins-Ravenel-Hill.

The Adams-Novikov SS ends up being cleaner, fewer differentials!

Table of $\pi_{n+k}S^n$: [here](http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~matwujie/homotopy_groups_sphere.html)

Interesting question: $\pi_0(X)$ can be defined for schemes. What are the higher homotopy groups? What do they measure? (More fundamentally, what do higher homotopy groups of spheres measure at all?)

WRT schemes, what are the homotopy spheres? What are the homology spheres, the Eilenberg-MacLane spaces?

It is ''well-known'' that the third stable homotopy group of spheres is cyclic of order 24. It is also "well-known" that the quaternionic Hopf map $\nu: S^7→S^4$, an $S^3$-bundle, suspends to a generator of $\pi_8(S^5)=\pi^{st}_3$. It is even better known that the complex Hopf map $\eta: S^3 \to S^2$ suspends to a generator of $\pi_4(S^3) = \pi^{st}_1=\ZZ_2$. For this, there is a reasonably elementary argument, see e.g. Bredon, Topology and Geometry, page 465.

As we have seen in this MO question, and also this one, the K3 surface plays an important role in the third stable homotopy group of spheres. It can be viewed as the source of the 24 in this group $\pi^{st}_3 = \ZZ_{24}$. Here is a brief review of how that goes: the stable homotopy groups (in degree $n$) of spheres are the same as cobordism classes of stably framed manifolds (of dimension $n$). In dimension 3 the generator is given by $\nu = (S^3,Lie)$, the 3-sphere with its Lie group framing (where we think of $S^3⊆H$ as the group of unit quaternions).


> The homotopy groups $\pi_i(S^3)$ for $i\leq 64$ are apparently computed in:

> Curtis, Edward B.,Mahowald, Mark, The unstable Adams spectral sequence for $S^3$, Algebraic topology (Evanston, IL, 1988), 125–162, Contemp. Math., 96, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 1989.

The Pontryagin-Thom construction shows that the stable homotopy groups of spheres are the same as the groups of stably framed manifolds up to cobordism.

The best overall summary of results would be Doug Ravenel's book on the homotopy groups of spheres, and I would also recommend Kochman's book. Read works of Mark Mahowald for results using the Adams spectral sequence, and Doug Ravenel for the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. Complete or nearly complete calculations for the homotopy groups of spheres that have been localized at a particular Morava K-theory have been made by Toda, Goerss-Henn-Mahowald-Rezk, and Mark Behrens. If you're interested in computer calculations of Ext, you should contact Robert Bruner or Christian Nassau. Many others have contributed to the calculation of homotopy groups of spheres and probably deserve to be mentioned (if I omitted someone, it was unintentional).

**One of the most recent spectacular advances in algebraic topology was the solution of (most of) the Kervaire invariant 1 problem by Hill, Hopkins and Ravenel about framed manifolds/stable homotopy groups of spheres.** They used a tremendous amount of stuff to solve this classical problem: equivariant topology, chromatic homotopy theory, spectral sequences, orthogonal spectra, abstract homotopy theory, ...

Question 1.2. Let $M$ be a closed $n$-manifold. Suppose $M$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^n$. Is $M$ homeomorphic to $S^n$? The answer turns out to be yes for all dimensions.

Question 1.4. Let $M$ be a closed $n$-manifold. Suppose $M$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$. Is $M$ diffeomorphic to $S^n$? For $n= 3$, the answer is yes. It is due to Moise [37] that every closed 3-manifold has a unique smooth structure.  In particular, the 3-sphere has a unique smooth structure.  **For n= 4, this question is wildly open.** For higher dimensions, Milnor [35] constructed an exotic smooth structure on $S^7$. Furthermore, Kervaire and Milnor [27] showed that the answer is not true in general for $n≥5$.

Question 1.6. For which $n$ does there exist a unique smooth structure on $S^n$? Kervaire and Milnor reduced Question 1.5 to a computation of the stable homotopy groups of spheres. In fact, Kervaire and Milnor constructed a group $Θ_n$, which is the group of h-cobordism classes of homotopy $n$-spheres. The group $Θ_n$ classifies the differential structures on $S^n$ for $n≥5$.

# Vector Bundles

**Definition:** A _rank $n$ vector bundle_ is a fiber bundle in which the fibers $F$ have the structure of a vector space $k^n$ for some field $k$; the structure group of such a bundle is a subset of $\GL(n, k)$.

Note that a vector bundle always has one global section: namely, since every fiber is a vector space, you can canonically choose the 0 element to obtain a global zero section.

**Proposition**: A rank $n$ vector bundle is trivial iff it admits $k$ linearly independent global sections.

**Example:** The tangent bundle of a manifold is an $\RR$-vector bundle. Let $M^n$ be an $n\dash$dimensional manifold. For any point $x\in M$, the tangent space $T_xM$ exists, and so we can define
$$
TM = \coprod_{x\in M} T_xM = \theset{(x, t) \mid x\in M, t \in T_xM}
$$

Then $TM$ is a manifold of dimension $2n$ and there is a corresponding fiber bundle
$$
\RR^n \to TM \mapsvia{\pi} M
$$

given by a natural projection $\pi:(x, t) \mapsto x$

**Example** A circle bundle is a fiber bundle in which the fiber is isomorphic to $S^1$ as a topological group. Consider circle bundles over a circle, which are of the form
$$
S^1 \to E \mapsvia{\pi} S^1
$$

There is a trivial bundle, when $E = S^1 \cross S^1 = T^2$, the torus:
![torus bundle](figures/torus-bundle.png)

There is also a nontrivial bundle, $E = K$, the Klein bottle:
![Klein bottle](figures/klein-bottle.png)

As in the earlier example involving the Möbius strip, since $K$ is nonorientable, $T^2 \not\cong K$ and there are thus at least two distinct bundles of this type.

---

*Remark*: A section of the tangent bundle $TM$ is equivalent to a _vector field_ on $M$.

**Definition**: If the tangent bundle of a manifold is trivial, the manifold is said to be *parallelizable*.

**Proposition:** The circle $S^1$ is parallelizable.

*Proof* Let $M = S^1$, then there is a rank 1 vector bundle\
$$\RR \to TM \to M$$
and since $TM = S^1 \cross \RR$ (why?), we find that $S^1$ is parallelizable. $\qed$

**Proposition:** The sphere $S^2$ is not parallelizable.

*Proof*: Let $M = S^2$, which is associated to the rank 2 vector bundle
$$\RR^2 \to TM \to M$$

Then $TM$ is trivial iff there are 2 independent global sections. Since there is a zero section, a second independent section must be everywhere-nonzero - however, this would be a nowhere vanishing vector field on $S^2$, which by the Hairy Ball theorem does not exist.

Alternate proof: such a vector field would allow a homotopy between the identity and the antipodal map on $S^2$, contradiction by basic homotopy theory.$\qed$

# Unstable homotopy groups of spheres
![Unstable Homotopy Groups of Spheres](figures/2-22ReadingNotes-52d83%201.png)

# Survey articles on homotopy groups of spheres
From Hatcher:

While my Algebraic Topology book and my unfinished book on spectral sequences (referred to in other answers to this question) contain some information about homotopy groups of spheres, they don't really qualify as a general survey or introduction. One source that fits this bill more closely is Chapter 1 of Doug Ravenel's "green book" Complex Cobordism and Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres, from 1986. This introductory chapter starts at a reasonably accessible level, with increasing prerequisites in the later sections of the chapter. More recent surveys ought to exist, although at the moment I can't recall any. With the recent solution of the Kervaire invariant problem by Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel, this would be a good time for an updated survey.

Connections between homotopy groups of spheres and low-dimensional geometry and topology have traditionally been somewhat limited, with the Hopf bundle being the thing that comes most immediately to mind. A fairly recent connection is Soren Galatius' theorem that the homology groups of $Aut(F_n)$, the automorphism group of a free group, are isomorphic in a stable range of dimensions to the homology groups of "loop-infinity S-infinity", the space whose homotopy groups are the stable homotopy groups of spheres.

Other posters have alluded to the Kervaire-Milnor theory (from "Groups of homotopy spheres. I") which shows how, via Pontryagin-Thom, our knowledge and ignorance about the stable homotopy groups of spheres is reflected in knowledge and ignorance about classification of manifolds. Maybe it's worth telling this (really beautiful!) story.

In each dimension $n$, one has a group $Θ_n$ of smooth $n$-manifolds that are homotopy $n$-spheres, up to h-cobordism, under connected sum. This has a subgroup $bP_{n+1}$ of boundaries of parallelizable $n+1$-manifolds. Assume n>4, so h-cobordism classes are diffeomorphism classes.

Every homotopy $n$-sphere $S$ can be shown to have a stable framing. Hence (by P-T) $S$ is a regular fibre of a map $S_{n+k}\to S_k$ for $k≫0$ whose class in $π_{n+k}(S_k)$ is the obstruction to $S$ (with chosen stable framing) being a framed boundary. Changing the stable framing amounts to adding something in the image of the $J$-homomorphism $J: π_n(SO(k)) \to π_{n+k}(S_k)$. So we get an injective homomorphism $Θ_n/bP_{n+1}→\coker(J)$ (which is onto e.g. for $n$ odd).

We don't know $\coker(J)$ in high dimensions, so we don't know the order of $Θ_n/bP_{n+1}$. But Serre's finiteness theorem for the stable stems tells us that $Θ_n/bP_{n+1}$ is finite!

The subgroup $bP_{n+1}$ is analyzed via surgery theory and the h-cobordism theorem. There's a nice summary in Lück's Basic introduction to surgery theory.

We have $bP_{odd}=0$. There's a formula for $bP_{4p}$ involving Bernoulli numerators; this comes from a known (thanks to Adams) part of the stable stems, namely, $\im(J)$.

Finally, $bP_{4p+2}$ is at most $Z_2$. Here $S$ bounds a parallelizable manifold $P$. We'd like to make this contractible. By framed surgery, we can kill the homotopy groups of $P$ below the middle dimension but the Arf invariant of the pairing on middle-dimensional homology obstructs the final step, that of killing $π_{p+1}$. Say this is non-zero. Can we do better by starting with a different $P$? Yes, if and only if there's a closed, framed $2_{p+2}$-manifold of Kervaire invariant one.

Browder showed that the Kervaire invariant can be one only when $4p+2=2l−2$ for some $l$, and Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel have shown that $l≤7$. Conclusion: $bP_{4p+2}$ is $Z_2$ except in dimensions 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126, where it's zero.

# Uniformization Theorem

The uniformization theorem says that every simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one of the three Riemann surfaces: the open unit disk, the complex plane, or the Riemann sphere. In particular it implies that every Riemann surface admits a Riemannian metric of constant curvature.

For compact Riemann surfaces, those with universal cover the unit disk are precisely the hyperbolic surfaces of genus greater than 1, all with non-abelian fundamental group; those with universal cover the complex plane are the Riemann surfaces of genus 1, namely the complex tori or elliptic curves with fundamental group $Z_2$; and those with universal cover the Riemann sphere are those of genus zero, namely the Riemann sphere itself, with trivial fundamental group.

The uniformization theorem is a generalization of the Riemann mapping theorem from proper simply connected open subsets of the plane to arbitrary simply connected Riemann surfaces.

Every Riemann surface is the quotient of a free, proper and holomorphic action of a discrete group on its universal covering and this universal covering is holomorphically isomorphic (one also says: "conformally equivalent" or "biholomorphic") to one of the following:

1. the Riemann sphere
2. the complex plane
3. the unit disk in the complex plane.

In 3 dimensions, there are 8 geometries, called the eight Thurston geometries. Not every 3-manifold admits a geometry, but Thurston's geometrization conjecture proved by Grigori Perelman states that every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces that are geometrizable.

## Smooth Category: Uniformization

Generally expect things to split into more classes.

- Dimension 0: The point (terminal object)
- Dimension 1: $\SS^1, \RR^1$
- Dimension 2: $\gens{\SS^2, \TT^2, \RP^2 \suchthat \SS^2 = 0,\,\,3\RP^2 = \RP^2 + \TT^2 }$. 
  - Classified by $\pi_1$ (orientability and "genus"). 
    Riemann, Poincare, Klein.
  - Every surface admits a complex structure and a metric. 
    Thus always orientable.
  - Uniformization: Holomorphically equivalent to a quotient of one of three spaces/geometries:
    - $\CP^1$, positive curvature (spherical)   
    - $\CC$, zero curvature (flat, Euclidean)
    - $\HH$ (equiv. $\DD^\circ$), negative curvature (hyperbolic)
  - Stratified by genus:
    - Genus 0: Only $\CP^1$
    - Genus 1: All of the form $\CC/\Lambda$, with a distinguished point $[0]$, i.e. an elliptic curve.
      - Has a topological group structure!
    - Genus $\geq 2$: Complicated?

# Research Meeting Notes, January 17

We began this session with me going over a bit of what I'd read the past week (mostly Postnikov tower and rational homotopy), and started with a question about some of the most trivial examples of spectral sequences. The reply was that the long exact sequence is probably the best example, but I still need to do a bit of work to see how the LES sits inside a SS (and also how Mayer Vietoris does).

I also mentioned a bit about what I'd read about sheaf and de-Rham cohomology, and we dove into the background of that a bit. We talked about the existence of smooth bump functions - functions that are identically zero outside of a compact interval. This is surprising! Consider things like $e^{-x^2/2}$, these are almost-but-not-quite zero away from zero. But you can define something like $e^{-1/x^2}\cdot\mathbb{1}[x > 0]$; this is actually smooth at zero but *decidedly* not analytic - it's not equal to its Taylor polynomial at zero (indeed, it is identically zero).

This highlights some of the differences that pop up in sheaf theory - we think of analytic objects as "rigid" and geometric, while smooth objects are somehow more "flexible". This is seen in analysis over $\CC^1$, where local knowledge of an analytic function determines its global behavior, but even over $\RR^1$ we find that there are many ways to continuously (and even smoothly) continue a function (e.g. extend by a polynomial of any degree in a piecewise fashion). So for $C^\infty$ manifolds, a lot more can happen.

We then segued into some intersection theory, especially over projective spaces. Some important ideas here were that in flexible situations, weird singular behaviors can be avoided. For example, intersections between curves with multiplicity $\RR^n$ can be perturbed slightly so that they either intersect with the "right" multiplicity, or not at all. For example, intersections of general conic sections $ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f$ in $\RR^2$ can be perturbed to intersect either twice or zero times, but interpolating between these two situations may coalesce the roots into a single point.

Over the complex numbers (since it is algebraically closed and curves are polynomials), the slight perturbation of (say) a quadratic will always deform singular points into two separate intersections. However, the singularities of the curves may be interesting themselves, and we might want information about those - so perturbing in such a way would result in losing that information. This is why algebraic geometry requires a bit more machinery, since we want to preserve information about these difficult spots.

The right sort of setting to study this kind of thing is usually a projective space of some kind. For example, one can take $\CP^2$ and adjoin an $S^2$ at infinity; then everything intersects this sphere. This is a way of compactifying the plane in order to make intersection theory more uniform - note that this is not the same a Stone-Cech compactification, which is just adding one point and declaring neighborhoods around it to be compact. (If I recall correctly). This is forming a compact space by pasting an entire separate space onto the boundary - for example, an entire line, or a circle or sphere.

Examples of this would be like $\CP^1 = \CC^1 \cup \{\infty\}$, or $\RP{2} = \RR^2 \cup \RP{1}$ (where we identify $\RP{1} \cong S^1$, this is adding a "circle at infinity" which every quadratic would intersect in two places (but really one, since they're identified)).

Some results this yields: any hyperbola can be "compactified" to a simple curve, in the right type of geometry. These essentially become sections of an ellipse in projective space - think of attaching a 2-cell to an equatorial 1-cell; then hyperbolas are sections of ellipses that intersect the equator.

When things are purely algebraic, though, a perfectly valid question to ask is something like where the locus $x^2 + y^2 = -1$ might lie (note that this has no real solutions). These is where you naturally go into $\CC^2$, and then compactify in the same sort of way to obtain $\CP^2 = \CC^2 \cup \CP^1$ where we can look at homogenous coordinates $[x:y:z]$. But then this is just a slice of the more general equation $x^2 + y^2 = -z^2$, for the case $z=1$. This leads naturally into classical algebraic geometry, where you hope for results like:

"The number of intersections of two curves of degrees $d_1, d_2$ is equal to $d_1\cdot d_2$".

# Summary

I met with Prof. Roberts for about an hour and a half today. At our last meeting, we had a bit of a discussion about what the research topic might be.

He relayed some of his experiences, such as one instance of trying to compute the homotopy groups of spheres - something like $\pi_5(S^2)$, which is a finite group of order 12, but it's difficult to determine whether it is $\ZZ_3\cross \ZZ_2\cross\ZZ_2$ or $\ZZ_3 \cross \ZZ_4$. He mentioned that he later found out that this was actually a "good" place to be stuck, because there was something actually challenging there! *Note: I think this is the thing Serre missed in his thesis.*

He also spoke about his experiences as a grad student. His advisor seemed to have 2 problems in mind to work on. One of them was studying a certain coefficient of a polynomial - it seemed like it should be there for a reason, and that explaining it was tractable. He found that he had some ideas on how to start on this one. The other problem was something more abstract, where it wasn't even clear where to start, even after a week of thinking about it.

I tossed out the idea of studying spectral sequences, because it was somewhat related to what we were studying in our topology class, but wasn't something we'd have much time to cover in class. This seemed tractable, since these are actually computable in some sense - at the end of the day, you can actually get a number of some sort out of it. He relayed some of his experience computing with them previously, noting how they could be a bit like a puzzle, finding different pieces here and there that allow you to compute differentials, then moving on to compute something else which in turn helped fill in a gap in something you'd previously visited.

I mentioned that I thought this would be a good topic for me because 1) it seemed like a powerful tool, even outside of topology (e.g. in algebraic geometry), and 2) there are a lot of auxiliary ideas that come into play that would be good to learn, like filtrations, fibrations, etc. He agreed, said he thought that'd be pretty fun, and we agreed to meet on Wednesday to go over his intro lecture and some references.



On Wednesday, we started into covering the content. He provided two references up front:

- **Rational Homotopy Theory and Differential Forms** by Griffiths and Morgan
  - This provides some Algebraic Topology background, things like
    - Fibrations
    - Obstructions
    - Postnikov towers
  - This also covers a bit about the Serre spectral sequence
- **Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology** by Bott and Tu
  - Essentially need the middle section, which focuses on spectral sequences in general
  - The examples are mostly related to sheaf/Cech (co)homology, which aren't as helpful in algebraic topology
  - The end section is good - reviews homotopy theory, path and loop fibrations, and the Serre spectral sequence

A few items that came up in conversation:

- Syzygies: for general modules, we can look at relations. The relations themselves form a submodule, so we can repeat the process of looking at "relations among relations". Eventually one arrives at the zero module
- Cohomological Dimension
- Differential forms
  - A bit like a measure, gives areas and volumes without the analytical cruft
- Rational homology, i.e. doing homology over based fields like $\QQ$, or taking a $p$-adic viewpoint by taking it over $\FF_p$ for various $p$.
- Dual spaces in the category of modules
  - Interesting note: Let $M = \bigoplus \ZZ$, then $M^* = \prod \ZZ$ essentially because of the way one specifies a linear map - on each coordinate. But then does $M^{**} \cong M$?
- Abelian categories
  - Essentially work like the category of modules over a ring, can usually choose elements for homological proofs rather than relying on "arrow-theoretic" arguments
- Modules
  - In vector spaces, every exact sequence splits - you can just take orthogonal complements. This doesn't work for arbitrary modules

I asked a bit about fibrations - these seem to be a generalization of the way covering space theory works, and also generalize homotopy lifting.

The general situation looks like this:
$$
\begin{CD}
F @>>> 	E\\
@. 		@VV{\pi}V \\
 		@. B
\end{CD}
$$

Here we regard $F$ as a fiber, and $B$ as a base space. This can be thought of as a family of $F$'s, parameterized by $B$. As opposed to covering space theory, where the fiber above any point of the base space is a set of discrete points, the fiber in this situation is free to be bigger. We also only requires that the fibers be equivalent up to homotopy, as opposed to homeomorphic as if covering space theory.

There is also a local triviality condition.

The canonical example is the Hopf fibration,
$$
\begin{CD}
S^1 @>>> 	S^3\\
@. 		@VV{\pi}V \\
 		@. S^2
\end{CD}
$$
a family of circles parameterized by spheres.



# The Machinery of a Spectral Sequence

## Goal

We are given a chain complex $(C^*, d: C^n \into C^{n+1})$, usually requiring $* \geq 0$. The goal is to compute $H(C^*, d)$, the total homology of this complex.

## Method

We'll use a filtration on the complex, usually written

$F^*C^* \definedas C^* = F^0C^* \supseteq F^1C^* \supseteq F^2C^* \supseteq \cdots \supseteq 0$

It's common for the filtration to be finite length on each individual chain complexes, so we have something like

$F^0C^n \supseteq F^1C^n \supseteq F^2C^n \supseteq \cdots F^nC^n \supseteq 0 = F^{n+1}C^n$

For the initial data, we'll have $H^n(\frac{F^p C^*}{F^{p+1}C^*})$ where we'll reindex for convenience to obtain $H^{p+q}(\frac{F^p C^*}{F^{p+1}C^*})$ and define this to be $E_1^{p,q}$ - this yields the first "page" of the spectral sequence. We'll refer to $\frac{F^p C^*}{F^{p+1}C^*}$ as the *associated graded complex* $G^pC^*$.

One potential issue here is that a priori, there's no particular reason this should be related to or yield the homology of the original complex - but in nice enough cases, there is a connection.

The reindexing is done so that this becomes a *first quadrant spectral sequence*, i.e. everything in the other three quadrants becomes zero.

Here we list out a sample $E_1$ page:

![clip_image001](/clip_image001.png)

The blue diagonal here is $H^2(\text{stuff})$, corresponding to all of the $E_1^{i,j}$ where $i+j = 2$. The differentials here move you one column to the right, and are actually the $\delta$ from the long exact sequence in homology.

Look at the **filtration degree**.

We then move on to define $E_2^{p,q}$ as $\frac{\ker d_1: E_1^{p,1} \into~\cdot }{\im d_1: \cdot ~\into E_1^{p,q}}$. This leads to a "knights move" for the differentials on the second page, moving up one and down-right two. Note that on the first page, moving right was the same as moving up one and down-right one.

Introduced how long exact sequences are sort of degenerate cases of spectral sequences, with only a few columns (?)

# The Cotangent Complex and Derived de Rham Cohomology

- Reference: [MSRI Workshop on Derived AG, Birational Geometry, Moduli Spaces](https://www.msri.org/workshops/862/schedules/25958).

- Specific Video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRPa-VAvl6Q>

## Motivation

Basic affine objects in AG: commutative rings, replace with simplicial commutative rings which we'll use as a base diagram.
Later: derived stacks and geometric derived stacks.
Here is an evolution of objects. and how we can think about them:

:::{.example title="Algebraic Spaces"}
Algebraic schemes/spaces, e.g. $\PP^n$.
Think of these as étale sheaves of sets (think functor of points), identified as discrete spaces:
\[  
\mathcal{S}_{\leq 0} \da \ts{\text{Discrete spaces}}
.\]
Every component is contractible, so there are no higher homotopy groups and we think of these as 0-truncated spaces.
:::

:::{.example title="Stacks"}
For $X$ a smooth and proper $k\dash$scheme, the Picard stack 
\[
\underline{\Pic}_{X/k}
\]
is an Artin stack, which is a subclass Deligne-Mumford stacks.
Note that this still has automorphisms given by global units on $X$.
Think of these as 
\[  
\mathcal{S}_{\leq 1} \da \ts{\text{Étale sheaves of groupoids}}
,\]
where the notation now suggests 1-truncated spaces, and we can take fundamental groupoids $\Pi_0$ since there is now 1-homotopy.
:::

:::{.remark}
Note that the Picard stack can be identified as a mapping stack,
\[  
\underline{\Map}(X, K(\GG_m, 1))
.\]
:::

:::{.example title="Higher Stacks"}
$K(\GG_m, n)$ is a "higher stack", thought of as a sheaf taking values in $n\dash$truncated spaces $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}$, i.e. a space where when basing at any point, there are no homotopy groups above degree $n$:
\[  
\mathcal{S}_{\leq n} \da \ts{\text{Étale sheaves of $n\dash$truncated spaces}}
.\]
This is a stack with a single point, where the isotopy is $K(\GG_m, n-1)$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Note that these are all built from affine schemes with a few acceptable moves.
:::

:::{.remark}
(DZG) The definitions of $\mathcal{S}_{j}$ above aren't explicitly stated, so these are guesses at slightly more precise definitions.
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
In stack notation, we can write
\[  
B\GG_m &= K(\GG_m, 1) \cong [\pt/\GG_m] \\
K(\GG_m, 2) &= [\pt / B\GG_m]
,\]
where the latter is a smooth Artin stack.
Mapping into this gives the Picard groupoid of a scheme.
These are higher geometric stacks that still have some "smoothness" properties.
:::

:::{.question}
What does it mean to give a map from a scheme $X$ into a higher stack?
:::

:::{.remark title="The fundamental process for building stacks"}
Note that the category of étale schemes taking values in $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}$ is enriched in topological spaces.
There is a topological space 
\[
M\da \Map(X, K(\GG_m, n))
\]
where the homotopy groups are 
\[  
\pi_i M = 
\begin{cases}
H^{n-i}_{\et}(X, \GG_m) & 0\leq i \leq n \\
0 & \text{else}
\end{cases}
.\]
So this higher geometric stack that says something about higher étale cohomology groups.
We thus have étale sheaves taking values in higher topological spaces, and has some geometric meaning.
They're also built from geometric objects: namely, iterating taking quotients by smooth actions.
$K(\GG_m, 1)$ is a quotient by a smooth algebraic group, $K(\GG_m, 2)$ is now a smooth *Artin stack*, and we can keep going.
This is the fundamental process for building geometric higher stacks.
:::


:::{.remark}
Why derive things?
Schemes are equipped with sheaves of commutative rings, so the basic idea is let the sheaves take values in groupoids, stacks, etc.
So we can consider replacing the structure sheaf $\OO_X$ is itself a sheaf of spaces, and this is the fundamental idea of derived algebraic geometry.
:::

## Derived Schemes

Consider $\spec k\tensor_{k[x]}^L k$, a derived tensor product.
This is a *simplicial commutative ring*, and the basic version of an *affine derived scheme*.
This is a complex $C^\wait$ with homology in degree 0 and 1, where 
\[
H_1 = \Tor^1(k\tensor_{k[x]} k)
\]
So analogously, we'll start with derived schemes and take quotients by smooth groups.
In the end, we get derived stacks.

:::{.example title="Fundamental"}
An example is $\mathcal{M}_\phi$, the moduli of objects in some DG category $\mathcal{C}$.
:::

## Simplicial Rings

We need to agree on what the local affine modules will look like. 
For our purposes, they'll be simplicial commutative rings.
Consider the **derived category** $\mathcal{C} \da D(\ZZ)_{\geq 0}$ and its connective[^def_connective]
objects, which are chain complexes $C_\wait$ where $H_{< 0}(C_\wait) = 0$.
There is a **derived tensor product** 
$\tensor^L$
which makes $\mathcal{C}$ into a symmetric monoidal category.

Basic idea: we want to look at commutative algebra objects in this symmetric monoidal category $({D}(\ZZ), \tensor^L)$.[^familiar_move]
Note that of working in a symmetric monoidal abelian category, we will be looking at connective chain complexes, and simplicial rings are one way of studying commutative algebra objects here.

[^familiar_move]: 
This is a familiar move: people in the 60s knew one could do AG in some ambient symmetric monoidal abelian category.

[^def_connective]:
**Connective** means $H_{<0} = 0$.


We have some choices for making sense of DAG:

- $E_\infty\dash$ring spectra

- Simplicial commutative rings.

- Over $\QQ$, $\QQ\dash$commutative DGAs.

Our choice here will be the following: 

:::{.definition title="Simplicial Commutative Ring"}
Let $\Delta$ denote the *simplex category*, the category of non-empty finite ordered sets with order-preserving maps.
We have the following situation:

\begin{tikzcd}
\left[0\right]
  \ar[r, shift right=2.0ex] \ar[r] \ar[r, shift left=2.0ex] 
& \left[1\right] 
  \ar[l]
  \ar[r, shift right=2.0ex] \ar[r] \ar[r, shift left=2.0ex] 
& \left[2\right]
  \ar[l, shift right=1.00ex]
  \ar[l, shift left=1.00ex]
& \cdots
\\
\ts{0}
& \ts{0\to 1} 
& \ts{0\to 1\to 2} 
& \cdots
\end{tikzcd}

The arrows going up are **face maps** (or **coface maps**), and the others are **degeneracy** maps.
If $\mathcal{C}$ is a category, then $s\mathcal{C} \da \Fun(\Delta\op, \mathcal{C})$ is the category of simplicial objects of $\mathcal{C}$.
:::


:::{.remark}
An analogy: simplicial commutative $k\dash$algebras enrich usual $k\dash$algebras much like the derived category $D(k)$ enriches $k\dash$modules.
:::


## Examples of Simplicial Categories

### a: Simplicial Sets and Topological Spaces

$\ssets \homotopic \Top$: this is not an equivalence of categories, but rather they have *equivalent homotopy theories*[^equiv_homotopy_theories], where we have notions of *weak equivalence*[^def_weak_equivalence] on each side.
Here there is an $n\dash$simplex on the LHS ($\ssets$), 
\[
\Delta^n = \hom_{\Delta}(\wait, [n])
\]
and on the RHS we have 
\[
\Delta^n_{\text{Top}}\da\ts{\tv{x_0, \cdots, x_n} \in \RR^n \st x_i\geq0,\, \sum x_i = 1}
\]

If you make a functor $\Delta^n \mapstofrom \Delta^n_{\text{Top}}$, then by Yoneda the presheaf category $\Presh(\Delta) \da \Fun(\Delta\op, \set)$ is generated by representable objects.
Everything on in $\ssets$ is generated by taking colimits of the $\Delta^n$, so we can make some assignment and extend by colimits to get a functor $\ssets \to \Top$.
We have a notion of weak equivalence for $\Top$, and so the notion of weak equivalence on $\ssets$ is just given by pullback along the functor $\ssets\to \Top$, and this induces an equivalence of homotopy theories.
The inverse functor $\Top \to \ssets$ is the **singular complex construction**.
Considering $\Delta^\wait_{\Top}$, this is a cosimplicial object in $\Top$.

:::{.remark}
$\Top$ will denote that 1-category, while $\mcTop$ will be its full $\infty\dash$category.
:::

So we have a natural cosimplicial object in $\Top$, 
so 
\[
\text{Sing}(X) \da \Hom_{\Top}(\Delta_{\Top}^\wait, X)
\]
is a simplicial object in $\ssets$.
As in singular homology, we can get a simplicial abelian group by taking the free abelian group $\ZZ[\Sing(X)]$.
Note that this is just composing functors $\Delta\op \to\Sets$ and $\Sets\to \mods{\ZZ}$.
We can use this to create a chain complex $C_\wait(\ZZ[\text{Sing}(X)])$, and as expected, we get the singular homology:
\[
H_i(C_\wait) \cong H^\Sing_i(X, \ZZ)
\]


[^def_weak_equivalence]: 
A **weak equivalence** is an isomorphism on $\pi_0$, and for each choice of basepoint, an isomorphism on all $\pi_{\geq 1}$ on each side.


[^equiv_homotopy_theories]: 
Theory up to weak equivalence.

### b: Simplicial Abelian Groups

We can take simplicial abelian groups $s\Ab$ and the connective objects $D(\ZZ)_{\geq 0}$; these have equivalent homotopy theories.
There is a notion of weak equivalence on the RHS, quasi-isomorphism, and asking if the literal underlying spaces on the LHS are weakly equivalence as spaces.
A specific way of doing this is the **Dold-Kan** correspondence:

:::{.proposition title="Dold-Kan Correspondence"}
Suppose we have a simplicial abelian group $M_\wait$, then we have face maps going to the left:
\begin{tikzcd}
  M_0
& M_1
  \ar[l, shift right=0.75ex, "\del_1"'] 
  \ar[l, shift left=0.75ex, "\del_2"] 
& M_2
  \ar[l, shift right=1.05ex] 
  \ar[l] 
  \ar[l, shift left=1.05ex] 
& \cdots
  \ar[l, shift right=2.15ex] 
  \ar[l, shift right=0.75ex] 
  \ar[l, shift left=0.75ex] 
  \ar[l, shift left=2.15ex] 
\end{tikzcd}
We make this into a chain complex by setting the differential to a graded sum:
\begin{tikzcd}
    M_0 
&&  M_1
  \ar[ll, "\sum (-1)^i \del_i"']
&&  M_2
  \ar[ll, "\sum (-1)^i \del_i"']
&&  \cdots

The homology of this complex turns out to be the same as the homotopy groups of the simplicial abelian group viewed as a topological space.

### c: Simplicial Commutative $k\dash$Algebras

Defined as 
\[
s\mathrm{CAlg}_k \da \Fun(\Delta\op,\mathrm{CAlg}_k)
,\]
where $k$ is some commutative ring.
This was studied by Quillen, and an impetus for model categories.
Models give a notion of weak equivalence and a "right way" of computing: for the usual derived category of a ring, this is taking free/projective/injective resolutions.
So the LHS is sometimes called a **non-abelian derived category**.

:::{.fact}
For $R\in \mathrm{sCAlg}$, the homotopy groups $\pi_* R$ have a graded commutative ring structure: $xy = (-1)^{\abs x \abs y}yx$ and $x^2 =0$ for elements $x$ with $\abs{x}$ odd. 
This is useful because it gives us some graded ring to associated to $R$.
:::

:::{.remark}
The category of simplicial abelian groups is equivalent to $\mathrm{Ch}(\ZZ)_{\geq 0}$; i.e. chain complexes of abelian groups concentrated in non-negative degree.
This also yields an equivalence of homotopy theories.
:::

A different perspective on simplicial commutative rings: 
there is an adjunction from sets to commutative $k\dash$algebras

\[  
\Set &\mapstofrom{}{} \mathrm{CAlg}_k \\
S &\mapsto K[S]
.\]
i.e. we send a set to the polynomial ring generated by $S$.
Any time such an adjunction exists, given an $R\in \mathrm{CAlg}_k$ we can construct a **simplicial resolution** $S^\wait$ and a map $S^\wait \to R$.
This resolution has the following structure:
\[  
S^0 = k[R], \,\, \text{the free commutative algebra on }R
.\]
Using the unit and counit maps of the adjunction, one obtains a canonical simplicial object,
\begin{tikzcd}
  k[R]
    \ar[r, shift right=2.0ex] 
    \ar[r, shift left=2.0ex] 
& k[k[R]] 
    \ar[l]
    \ar[r, shift right=2.0ex] 
    \ar[r] 
    \ar[r, shift left=2.0ex] 
& \cdots 
    \ar[l, shift right=1.00ex]
    \ar[l, shift left=1.00ex]
\end{tikzcd}
Moreover, $S^\wait \mapsvia{\sim} R$ is a homotopy equivalence.
So we've taken an arbitrary $k\dash$algebra and replaced it with a *simplicial* $k\dash$algebra which is given by polynomial rings in each degree, typically in infinitely many variables, which has the same homology.
This is the analog of a projective resolution.

Now define $\mathrm{CAlg}_k^{\text{poly}}$ as the category of finitely generated polynomial rings, and suppose you have a functor
\[  
\mathrm{CAlg}_k^{\text{poly}} 
\mapsvia{F} 
\mathcal{C}
\]
where $\mathcal{C}$ is a "reasonable" category or possible in $\infty\dash$category.
We can consider the category 
$\Ind(\mathrm{CAlg}_k^{\text{poly}})$ 
given by formally adjoining filtered colimits.
We have the following diagram,
\begin{tikzcd}
  \mathrm{CAlg}_k^{\text{poly}} 
    \ar[d, hook]
    \ar[r, "F"]
& \mathcal{C}
\\
  \Ind(\mathrm{CAlg}_k^{\text{poly}})
    \ar[d, hook, "\text{Constant diagrams}"']
    \ar[ur, "\exists \tilde F"']
& 
\\
  \mathrm{sCAlg}_k
  \ar[uur, bend right, "\exists LF"']
&
\end{tikzcd}
where the bottom inclusion is given by viewing a commutative ring as the constant simplicial commutative ring, and
the extension $\tilde F$ exists by applying $F$ to any colimit diagram.
The functor $LF$ is a derived functor that exists if $\mathcal{C}$ has certain colimits.

So starting with a functor defined on finitely generated polynomial rings, i.e. affine spaces, we get a simplicial derived functor.
For $R\in \mathrm{CAlg}_k$, using $S^\wait \mapsvia{\sim} R$, we can apply $F$ level-wise to get a new simplicial object $F(S^\wait) \in \mathcal{C}$.
Then $LF(R)$ is defined by taking the colimit over $\Delta$ yields the geometric realization, i.e. 
\[
LF(R) \da \hocolim_{\Delta} F(S^\wait) = \abs{F(S^\wait)}
\]
So we can promote functors on polynomial rings to functors on simplicial commutative rings.
This ends up being a Kan extension.
There is a nice universal property here, namely that functors out of $\mathrm{sAlg}_k$ are equivalent to functors out of $\mathrm{CAlg}_k^{\text{poly}}$ that satisfy some additional properties.

The last example will be the cotangent complex.

## The Cotangent Complex

There are 3 equivalent ways to view the cotangent complex.

### 1: A Derived Functor Approach

Use this derived functor approach: it will essentially be the derived functor of taking $\Omega^1$.
Suppose $k \to R$ in commutative rings, denote by $S^\wait$ again the canonical resolution of $R$, yielding a diagram
\begin{tikzcd}
k 
  \ar[rd, ""]
  \ar[rr, ""] 
& 
& R
\\
& S^\wait 
  \ar[ru, "\sim"] 
& 
\end{tikzcd}
Take Kahler differentials degree-wise to get 
$\Omega^1_{S^\wait/k}$
.
Now base-change along this map to get a simplicial $R\dash$module,
\[  
\Omega^1_{S^\wait/k} \tensor_{S^\wait} R \,\, \in \mathrm{sMod}\dash R
.\]
We can now use Dold-Kan to view this as a connective object in $D(R)_{\geq 0}$, the derived category of $R$, yielding $\mathrm{sMod}\dash R \homotopic D(R)_{\geq 0}$, so we define the **cotangent complex of $R/k$** as
\[  
L_{R/k} \da \Omega^1_{S^\wait/k} \tensor_{S^\wait} R \,\, \in D(R)_{\geq 0}
.\]

This turns out to work if you take a resolution other than the canonical one.
A downside to this definition is that it's not clear how/why it might depend on the resolution.


### 2: Extending Functors

We can define them by taking a map
\[  
\mathrm{CAlg}_k^{\text{poly}} \mapsvia{\Omega^1_{\wait/k}} D(k)_{\geq 0}
\]
to the connective objects in the derived category of $k$.
We can extend to get a diagram
\begin{tikzcd}
  \mathrm{CAlg}_k^{\text{poly}} 
  \ar[rr, "{\Omega^1_{\wait/k}}"] 
  \ar[dd, hook]
&& D(k)_{\geq 0}
\\
\\
  \mathrm{sCalg}_k
  \ar[rruu, "{\Omega^1_{\wait/k}}"'] 
&& 
\end{tikzcd}

It then turns out that
$L_{R/k} \homotopic L\Omega^1_{R/k}$.
Here it's not quite clear why this lands in $\mods{k}$ instead of $\mods{R}$, or how the $R\dash$module structure works here.

### 3: A Universal Property

Let $k\to R\to S$ where $k$ is a commutative ring and $R, S$ are ordinary (or simplicial) commutative rings.
Let $M\in \mods{S}$ in $D(S)_{\geq 0}$. 
There is a natural enrichment in topological spaces, so we'll write $\Map$ for homs with their topological structure.
In particular, these have homotopy groups.
The universal property that the cotangent complex has comes from an equivalence
\[  
\Map_R(L_{R/k}, M) 
\homotopic
\Map_{\mathrm{sCAlg}_{k//S}}(R, S\oplus M)
.\]
where the latter is in the category of simplicial commutative $k\dash$algebras with a *fixed* map to $S$, a bit like a comma category.
This makes sense because $R\to S$ is a fixed map, and $S\oplus M$ has a projection to $S$, i.e. this is a square zero extension.

:::{.remark}
The point of simplicial commutative rings is that this extension still makes sense, even when $M$ is a chain complex.
It's still possible to make this into a simplicial commutative ring.
This may look familiar from the exercises in Hartshorne, since it resembles the definition of Kahler differentials.
:::


#### Exercises Using the Universal Property

:::{.exercise title="?"}
Prove that
\[  
\pi_0 L_{R/k} \cong \Omega^1_{R/k}
.\]
This is exactly lifting through the square zero extension.
This is similar to having a lift
\begin{tikzcd}
& S\oplus M
    \ar[d]
\\
  R 
    \ar[r, "f"]
    \ar[ur, dotted, "\tilde f"]
& S
\end{tikzcd}
where giving $\tilde f$ is like giving a derivation $R\to M$.
So the RHS comma category mapping space in the previous equivalence is denoted the "space of derivations of $R$ and $M$" (whatever that means)
:::


:::{.exercise title="?"}
You can base-change the cotangent complex of $R/K$ to $S$ and obtain an exact triangle/cofiber sequence
\begin{tikzcd}
  S \tensor_R^L L_{R/k}
    \ar[r]
& L_{S/k}
    \ar[r]
&   L_{S/R}
\end{tikzcd}
This follows from the universal property above, and is a form of "transitivity".
:::

:::{.exercise title="?"}
Given a diagram
\begin{tikzcd}
  K 
    \ar[r]
    \ar[d]
& R 
    \ar[d]
\\
  T 
    \ar[r]
& R\tensor_k^L T 
\end{tikzcd}
show that 
\[  
T\tensor_k^L L_{R/k} \cong L_{R\tensor_k^L T / T}
.\]
:::

All of these follow from just the mapping space property, but require thinking about what it means to compute maps in a comma category.


:::{.exercise title="?"}
Let $R$ be a perfect $\FF_p\dash$algebra, so the Frobenius is an isomorphism:
\[  
F: R &\mapsvia{\sim} R\\
x &\mapsto x^p
.\]
Show that $L_{R/\FF_p} \cong 0$.
:::

## Derived de Rham Cohomology

We can make a specific functor:
\[  
\calg_k^{\poly} 
&\to
D(k)\\
R &\mapsto \dR_{R/k} \da \qty{R\to \Omega^1_{R/k} \to \Omega^2_{R/k} \to \cdots}
,\]
which takes a polynomial ring $R$ to its algebraic de Rham complex.
If $R$ is finitely generated, then the complex is bounded.
One can formally extend by deriving this functor to obtain
\begin{tikzcd}
  \calg_k^\poly 
    \ar[rr, "\dR_{\wait/k}"]
    \ar[dd, hook]
&&
  D(k)
\\ \\
  \scalg_k
    \ar[uurr, "L\dR_{\wait/k}"']
\end{tikzcd}

:::{.remark}
The point is that we know de Rham cohomology behaves well for smooth things, and we want to extend to non-smooth things.
:::

:::{.warnings}
Suppose $k \in \alg_\QQ$, noting that we're in characteristic zero, and let $R \in \calg_k^\poly$ be a polynomial ring.
Then $\dR_{R/k} \cong k$ by the Poincaré lemma, just the cohomology of affine space.
Then $L\dR_{S/k} \cong k$, which is disappointing.
:::

### The Hodge Filtration

How to fix this: we have the Hodge filtration $F_H^\wait \dR_{R/k}$, and the graded pieces are given by 
\[
\gr^i_H \dR_{R/k} \cong \Omega^i_{R/k}[-i] \cong \Lambda^i \Omega^1_{R/k}
,\]
a shifted version of the $i$th exterior power 1-forms.
Taking these gradings is compatible with colimits, so we can remember the filtration in the Kan extension, yielding a canonical Hodge filtration on $L\dR$, $F^*_H L \dR_{\wait/k}$.
The graded pieces are given by
\[  
\gr^i_H L\dR_{\wait /k} \cong L \Lambda^i L_{R/k}[-i]
,\]
i.e. you take derived exterior powers of the cotangent complex, shifted by some degrees.
This follows because doing the Kan extension on the graded pieces is deriving the functor $\gr^i_H \dR_{\wait/k}$.
We can complete with respect to this filtration, which we'll write has 

\[
\hat{L\dR_{\wait/k}} \da \inverselim L\dR_{\wait/k} / F_H^i
,\]
where you quotient out by the $i$th piece of the filtration.
Note that this definition is a general way of taking completions.[^what_its_like]

[^what_its_like]: 
This is like defining the $p\dash$adics as the limit of $\ZZ/p^n\ZZ$.


:::{.theorem title="Bhatt, Grothendieck, Hartshorne"}
Suppose $X/\CC$ is finite type, then
\[
R \Gamma(X,  \hat{ L\dR_{\OO_X/ k} } ) 
\cong
R \Gamma_{\Sing}(X(\CC), \CC)
,\]
where the RHS is the singular cohomology of the $\CC\dash$points.
This is a generalization of Grothendieck's theorem in the smooth case.
A positive feature is that this doesn't depend on a choice of putting $X$ in an ambient smooth scheme.

Neat trick from algebraic geometry: For a stack $\mathcal M =X/G$ where $X$ is a $\CC\dash$variety and $G$ is a finite group, then
$$
H^\wait(\mathcal M; \QQ) \cong \left( H^\wait(X; \QQ)\right)^G
$$
where the RHS denotes the taking the $G\dash$ invariant part. Seems to only work over $\QQ$. The quotient is scheme-theoretic. The actual definite involves equivariant cohomology.

Stacks and orbifolds are concepts from algebraic geometry (respectively geometric topology) that allow us to talk about objects that locally look like the quotient of a smooth object by a group action, in a way that remembers information about the isotropy groups of the action.  Such 'stacky' objects can behave like smooth  objects  even  if  the  underlying  spaces  have  singularities.   As  for  spaces,  manifolds,and schemes, cohomology theories are important invariants also for stacks and orbifolds, and examples such as ordinary cohomology or K-theory lend themselves to generalization.  Special cases of orbifolds are 'global quotients', often denoted M/G, for example for a smooth action of a compact Lie group G on a smooth manifold M.  In such examples, the orbifold cohomology of M/G is supposed to be the G-equivariant cohomology of M.  This suggests away to do orbifold cohomology theories by means of equivariant stable homotopy theory,via suitable G-spectra.  However, since the group G is not intrinsic and can vary, one needs equivariant cohomology theories for all groups G, with some compatibility.  Global homotopy theory makes this idea precise.

# Spectral Sequences

## The Purpose of a Spectral Sequence
Throughout this section, we will be considering $R\dash$modules over some fixed ring $R$, and we will try to use cohomological indexing wherever possible so that $H^n(\dash)$ denotes taking the $n\dash$th cohomology.

Broadly speaking, a spectral sequence is a tool from homological algebra that extends the notion of an exact sequence to more complicated situations in which a number of long exact sequences interact in nontrivial ways. A situation such as this carries an inordinate amount of data, and a spectral sequence provides a way of compressing this data in such a way that makes computations with it feasible. They were first introduced by Jean Leray around 1946, a French mathematician whose specialty was primarily in differential equations. However, around 1940 he was captured and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in Austria, where he remained imprisoned until 1945. Fearing that his expertise would be used for wartime efforts, he turned his attention to Topology and formulated sheaf theory. He soon found himself faced with a need to compute a variant of sheaf cohomology, which gave rise to the first spectral sequence (often referred to as the *Leray Spectral Sequence*). These were soon adapted to a number of different situations, most of which were eventually found to be special cases of the *Grothendieck spectral sequence* which expresses how derived functors behave under composition.

For the purposes of this paper, we will primarily make use of the *Serre spectral sequence* as a computational tool that generalizes the notion of a long exact sequence in order  to study the cohomology groups of a space $X$, which we will denote $H^n(X)$. They are a particularly powerful tool in this regard, as they can often also be used to compute not only the cohomology groups, but also its structure as a graded ring, given by $H^*(X) = \bigoplus_{i\geq 0} H^i(X)$ equipped with the cup product $$\smile: H^i(X) \tensor H^j(X) \to H^{i+j}(X)$$

As is often the case with long exact sequences, we will often be interested in "two out of three" situations - that is, we will be studying space $A$ with two associated spaces $B$ and $C$ for which the cohomology is either known or simply easier to compute. A spectral sequence will then provide way of relating the cohomology rings $H^*(A)$, $H^*(B)$, and $H^*(C)$, allowing information about any two of the three spaces to be leveraged to yield information about the third. In particularly nice situations, the cohomology of the two associated spaces may entirely characterize the cohomology of the third, although as we will soon see, this will not always be the case due to the presence of extension and lifting problems.


This technique becomes especially powerful when combined with the tools of homotopy theory - in particular, the Hurewicz theorem provides a bridge between homotopy and homology, and with some orchestration, one can set up a situation in which any desired homotopy group $\pi_i(X)$ will be isomorphic to $H_i(Y)$ for some potentially complicated space $Y$. Applying a spectral sequence to compute the cohomology of $Y$ thus provides a method (of which there seem to be very few!) of algebraically computing the homotopy groups of $X$, which can be continued inductively to compute $\pi_{i+k}(X)$ for any $k$. In practice, this introduces a nontrivial amount of complexity at each step, and the requisite computations can quickly become quite difficult, but one can often glean valuable information at early stages, and often information that is hard to ascertain by other means. In their full generality, spectral sequences can used to yield relatively easy proofs of theorems such as the commutativity of $\tor_R^i(\wait, \wait)$ over $R\dash$modules, or that various cohomology theories yield isomorphic results.




## Algebraic Preliminaries

### Definitions: Homological Algebra
We first set up some preliminary algebraic definitions. Throughout this section, we will work over the category $\mathbf{R\dash Mod}$ of left modules over some fixed ring $R$, and we will implicitly assume all indexing is cohomological.

A **monoid** is a set $S$ with an associative binary operation, which we will denote $+$, along with an identity element, and is thus characterized by the data $(S, +)$. A monoid can be thought of as a group in which elements need not necessarily have inverses, and common examples include $\NN$ and $\ZZ$. For our purposes, they will serve as the most general algebraic structure that can be used as to indexing in a sensible way.

A **complex** of modules with respect to a monoid $S$ is defined to be a collection of modules

$$A^\wait = \theset{A^s \mid s \in S}$$

where $S$ is thought of as an indexing set. A complex is said to be $S\dash$**graded** if it admits a decomposition

$$A^\wait = \bigoplus_{s\in S} A^s = A^{s_1} \oplus A^{s_2} \oplus \cdots$$

that "respects the grading" in the sense that the decomposition satisfies $A^i A^j \subseteq A^{i+j}$, where $A^i A^j = \theset{a\cdot b \mid a \in A^i, b\in A^j}$ and $(\cdot)$ denotes multiplication within the module $A^\wait$.
Unless otherwise specified, one often implicitly takes $S=\NN$ or $\ZZ$ and simply refers to the corresponding complexes as **graded complexes**.

Because the most common situation is $S=\ZZ$, elements $i\in S$ are referred to as **degrees** or indices. Each module $A^i$ is thus referred to as the "$i$th graded piece" of the complex $A^\wait$, and elements in $A^i$ are denoted "homogeneous elements of degree $i$".

It is also common to take $S = \ZZ^2$, and the resulting $\ZZ^2\dash$graded complex $A^{\wait, \wait}$ is denoted a **bigraded complex** or a **double complex**. Such complexes can equivalently be thought of as a family of modules $A^{i, j}$, each characterized by a pair of indices $(i, j)$ denoted its **bidegree**, which are often depicted as elements on an integer lattice:
![Double Complex](figures/ddnoarows.png)

Given a graded complex $A^\wait$, one may also consider maps between the graded pieces. which take the form $d^s: A^s \to A^t$. Without loss of generality, one can assume $s \leq t$ and setting $i = t-s$, this may be rewritten as $d^s: A^s \to A^{s+i}$.We thus define the **degree** of $d$ to be the quantity $i$, or occasionally it is said that $d$ "moves along the grading by $i$". Such complexes are often depicted on a 2 dimensional integer lattice, as in the following image:


Similarly, one may consider maps within a double complex of the form

$$d^{s,t}: A^{s,t} \to A^{s+i, t+j}$$

in which case we refer to the pair $(i,j)$ as the **bidegree** of $d$.

Note that given any double complex $A^{\wait, \wait}$, one can reduce the dimensionality of the grading by forming a new $\ZZ\dash$graded complex $B^{\wait}$ defined by
$$B^n = \bigoplus_{i+j=n} A^{i, j}$$

With this in mind, an element $A^{i,j}$ with bidegree $(i, j)$ is said to have **total degree** equal to $i+j$.

If a graded complex is equipped with a map $$d^s: A^s \to A^t$$ satisfying $d^t \circ d^s = 0$, then $d$ is referred to as a **differential**. This condition is often abbreviated by suppressing the indices and one simply writes $d^2 = 0$. The data of a complex equipped with a differential is abbreviated $(A^\wait, d^\wait)$ and referred to as a **differential graded complex**.

One can then define a **chain complex** of $R\dash$modules to be differential $\ZZ\dash$graded complex with a differential of degree 1. In other words, it is a collection of modules along with maps

$$\theset{(A^i, d^i: A^i \to A^{i+1}) \mid i \in \ZZ}$$

for which the $d^i$ increase the grading by 1 and satisfy $d^{i+1} \circ d^i = 0$. One often writes this as a sequence

$$ \cdots ~\mapsvia{d^{-3}} A^{-2} \mapsvia{d^{-2}} A^{-1} \mapsvia{d^{-1}} A^0 \mapsvia{d^{0}} A^1 \mapsvia{d^1} A^2  \mapsvia{d^2} ~\cdots$$

The data of a chain complex as is often abbreviated as a  pair $(A^\wait, d)$ satisfying $d^2 = 0$.

Given a chain complex $(A^\wait, d)$, one can define the **homology** of the complex at the $i$th position by taking kernels module images with respect to the differentials:

$$h^{i}(A^\wait) = \frac{\ker \left(d^i: A^i \to A^{i+1}\right)}{\im \left(d^{i-1}: A^{i-1} \to A^i\right)}$$

Note that the notion of a chain complex generalizes the notion of an exact sequence -- in fact, an exact sequence is exactly a chain complex for which the homology vanishes everywhere, so that $h^i(A^\wait) = 0$ for every $i$. Such chain complexes are said to be **acyclic**, and one can think of the homology of a chain complex as a measurement of how far the sequence of modules deviates from exactness.


With these definitions in place, one can define higher dimensional generalizations of chain complexes by altering the index set. We will primarily be concerned with **differential graded double complexes**, which is a shorthand for differential $\ZZ^2\dash$graded complexes. These are collections of modules equipped with differentials of a given bidegree $(s,t)$

$$\theset{(A^{i,j}, d^{i, j}: A^{i, j} \to A^{i+s, j+t}) \mid (i, j) \in \ZZ \cross \ZZ}$$

satisfying $d^2 = 0$.

Just as with chain complexes, one can define the homology of a differential graded double complex at the $(i,j)$ position by taking kernels modulo images with respect to the given differential:
$$h^{i, j}(A^{\wait, \wait}) = \frac{\ker \left(d^{i,j}: A^{i,j} \to A^{i+s,j+t}\right)}{\im \left(d^{i-s, j-t}: A^{i-s, j-t} \to A^{i, j}\right)}$$

With these definitions in place, it becomes easy to state what a spectral sequence _is_ and deduce some of the immediate consequences of its definition:

### Definition: Spectral Sequence
A **cohomological spectral sequence** is a sequence of differential graded double complexes $\theset{E_r^{\wait, \wait} \mid r \in \NN}$, each equipped with a differential of bidegree $(r, -r+1)$.

Explicitly, it is the data of a sequence of $\ZZ^2\dash$graded modules

$$\theset{\bigoplus_{(i,j) \in \ZZ^2}E^{i, j}_r \mid r\geq 0}$$

equipped with differentials of bidegree $(r, -r+1)$

$$d^{i,j}_r : E^{i,j}_r \to E^{i+r,j-r+1}_r$$

that move along the $(i,j)$ grading and satisfy $$d_r^{i+r, j-r+1}\circ d_r^{i, j} = 0$$


The index $r$ is often referred to as a **page** of the spectral sequence, and for $r\geq 0$, we inductively define $E_{r+1}^{i,j} = h(E_r^{i,j})$. Explicitly, we have

$$E_{r+1}^{i,j} = \frac{\ker \left(d_r^{i,j}:E^{i,j}_r \to E^{i+r,j-r+1}_r\right)}{\im \left(d_r^{i-r,j+r-1}:E^{i-r,j+r-1}_r \to E^{i,j}_r\right)}$$

so that the element at the $(i,j)$ position on page $r+1$ is obtained by taking the homology at the $(i,j)$ position on page $r$ with respect to the given differentials.

In the literature, one often suppresses indices outside of explicit computations and writes $(E_r, d_r)$ to denote the $r$th page with its corresponding differential and $E_{r+1} = h(E_r)$ to denote that each page is obtained by taking the homology of the previous page.
$\endef$

Although this definition makes the structure explicit, the abundance of indices needed to describe such a thing can obscure the relative simplicity of the setup. As with general double complexes, one often depicts each page of a spectral sequence as a collection of objects position on a planar lattice, broken up into quadrants based on the signs of the indices. The $i$ component is generally taken to be horizontal coordinate, and the $j$ to be the vertical.

Note that given any differential graded double complex $\theset{(A^{i, j}, d^{i,j}) \mid (i, j) \in \ZZ^2})$, there is naturally an associated spectral sequence obtained by setting $E_0^{i, j} = A^{i,j}$ and inductively letting $E_r = h(E_{r-1})$ for $r \geq 1$. Conversely, we can think of the $E_0^{\wait, \wait}$ as a differential graded double complex in its own right.

Spectral sequences are perhaps best understood through example, and so it is worth explicitly enumerating the elements and differentials on the first few pages of generic sequence.

In general, elements on the zeroth page of a spectral sequence, corresponding to $r=0$ will have differentials of bidegree $(0, 1)$ and will thus move the grading up along the vertical direction, and thus $E_0^{\wait, \wait}$ will have the following form:

![Page 0 with differentials](figures/SS%20Page%200%20with%20Differential.png)

Similarly, taking $r=1$ to obtain to first page will yield differentials of bidegree $(1, 0)$ which will move the grading forward horizontally, giving $E_1^{\wait, \wait}$ the following form:

![Page 1 with differentials](figures/SSPage1WithDifferential.png)

And taking $r=2$ to obtain the second page yields differentials of bidegree $(2, -1)$, giving $E_2^{\wait, \wait}$ the following form:

![Page 2 with differentials](figures/SSPage2WithDifferential.png)

When working with spectral sequences, it is often the case that one is interested in what happens to a single entry as one steps along pages, and so it is also worth observing the pattern of differentials emanating from a single point:

![Differentials from a given entry](figures/SSDoubleComplexDifferentialPattern.png)

And so we see that differentials whose source is at coordinate $(p, q)$ tend to have targets having total degree $(p+q)+1$, forming a diagonal line _above_ the element in question. In this image, we have $(p,q) = (0,1)$, and so we expect differentials to hit elements of total degree $(0+1)+1 = 2$ as we move through the pages. This is indeed the case, as the targets of the corresponding differentials are $E_0^{0,2}, E_1^{1,1}, E_2^{2,0}$ respectively on each page.

In a dual fashion, given a single entry, one is often interested in which differentials target that entry:

![Differentials that target a given entry](figures/SSDoubleComplexDifferentialPatternOutOfNode.png)

And so we see that given an entry at coordinate $(p, q)$, the differentials that target it tend to come from elements of total degree $(p+q)-1$, lying on a diagonal line _below_ the element we are interested in. In this image, we are looking at the coordinate $(p, q) = (2, 0)$, and so we expect differentials to come from elements of total degree $(2+0)-1 = 1$. This is indeed the case, as we find that the sources of the corresponding differentials come from $E_0^{2,-1}, E_1^{1,0}, E_0^{0,1}$ and so on.

A chain complex $(C^\wait, d)$ is said to **bounded** if there exists some $N$ such that for all $n$ with $|n| \geq N$, $C^n = 0$, or equivalently $C^i = 0$ for all but finitely many values of $i$. For a double complex $(A^{\wait, \wait}, d)$ we can similarly define a notion of boundedness by requiring that $A^{i, j} = 0$ for all but finitely many pairs $(i, j) \in \ZZ^2$.

With this in mind, it becomes clear that if $E_0^{\wait, \wait}$ is bounded, then it is supported on a finite subset of $\ZZ^2$ and one can thus uniformly pick an $N$ such that for all $r > N$, every element $E_r^{i, j}$ with total degree $i+j > N$ will be zero.

As a consequence, for all $r\geq N$, all differentials entering any element will come from 0 objects, and all differentials emanating from that element will target 0 objects as well.

Explicitly, for any given coordinate $(p, q)$ of interest, we can use the fact that every differential has bidegree $(r,-r+1)$ to identify both the incoming differentials
$$
d_r^{p-r. q+r-1}: E_r^{p-r, q+r-1} \to E_r^{p, q}
$$

as well as the outgoing differentials
$$
d_r^{p,q}: E_r^{p, q} \to E_r^{p+r, q-r+1}
$$


**Lemma**: If $E_r^{i, j} = 0$ for any $r$, then it is zero on every subsequent page and we have $E_{r+k}^{i, j} = 0$ for every $k$.

This follows from the fact that the incoming differential

$$d_r^{i-r,j-r+1}: E_r^{i-r,j-r+1} \to E_r^{i, j}$$

has codomain zero and thus $\im\left(d_r^{i-r,j-r+1} \right) = 0$. Similarly,

$$d_r^{i,j}: E_r^{i,j} \to E_r^{i+r, j-r+1}$$

has domain zero and thus $\ker\left(d_r^{i,j}\right) = 0$. One then computes

$$
E_{r+1}^{i,j} = h(E_r^{i,j}) = \frac{\ker\left(d_r^{i,j}\right)}{\im\left(d_r^{i-r,j-r+1} \right)} = 0
$$

which establishes the lemma inductively. $\qed$


With this lemma in hand, we can now prove the following theorem:
[Define convergence here]

### **Theorem**: A bounded spectral sequence converges.

Since the complex is bounded, we pick a uniform $N$ large enough such that $r-1 > N$ implies that every $E_0^{i, j}$ with either $|i| \geq r-1$ or $|j| \geq r-1$ is zero.

Then fix a coordinate $(i,j)$, where without loss of generality we assume that $i\geq 0$ and $j\geq 0$, and consider what happens at the $r$th page. We can use the fact that every differential has bidegree $(r,-r+1)$ to explicitly identify both the incoming differentials
$$
d_r^{i-r. q+r-1}: E_r^{i-r, j+r-1} \to E_r^{p, q}
$$

as well as the outgoing differentials
$$
d_r^{i,j}: E_r^{i, j} \to E_r^{i+r, j-r+1}
$$

However, in the first case, we have $j+r-1 \geq r-1$ and thus $E_r^{i-r, j+r-1} = 0$ by our choice of $r$. Similarly, in the second case we have $i+r \geq r$ and so $E_r^{i+r, j-r+1} = 0$ as well, and thus the situation is as follows
$$
0 \mapsvia{d_r^{p-r, q+r-1}} E_r^{p,q} \mapsvia{d_r^{p,q}} 0
$$

and we find that

$$
E_{r+1}^{p,q} = \frac{\ker\left( d_r^{p,q}: E_r^{p, q} \to E_r^{p+r, q+r}\right)}{\im\left( d_r^{p-r. q+r-1}: E_r^{p-r, q+r-1} \to E_r^{p, q}\right)} = \frac{E_r^{p,q}}{0} = E_r^{p,q}
$$

In other words, for every coordinate $(i, j)$, there exists a page $r_{ij}$ at which the entry **stabilizes** and does not change on any page thereafter.

If the complex is bounded, one can then take $R = \max \theset{r_{ij} \mid E_0^{i,j} \neq 0}$ to obtain a finite page $R$ after which _all_ entries stabilize. When this happens, one defines $E_\infty^{i,j} = E_R^{i,j}$ and the spectral sequence is said to **converge** to $E_\infty$, which is often written as
$$E_R^{i, j} \Rightarrow E_\infty^{i,j}$$

When such a page $R$ exists, the sequence is also sometimes said to **collapse** at page $R$.

We will thus primarily be interested in bounded spectral sequences, as the limiting object $E_\infty$ will not only provide valuable information, but it will often be the case that the spectral sequence collapses within the first few pages -- in nearly all of the cases we consider here, the sequences will collapse at $E_2$ or $E_3$, and sometimes even earlier.

Many of the spectral sequences we will encounter can be indexed such that all elements conveniently lie within the quadrant $i \geq 0, j\geq 0$. Such sequences are referred to as **first quadrant spectral sequences**.

## Construction from a Filtration

Although we have asserted that spectral sequences exist, it is perhaps not yet clear how such sequences come about. Spectral sequences are generally constructed in one of two equivalent ways: as either a structure that arises from a filtration on a chain complex, or through the formalism of *exact couples*.

Although the latter approach allows slightly more generalization, this comes at the price of increased opacity. Since both yield the same algebraic statements, we will opt to use the filtration approach instead.

We start off with a simple goal in mind: suppose we are given a chain complex $(C^{\wait}, d^\wait)$ with a differential of degree 1, and we are interested in finding its homology ring $h^*(C^\wait)$.

Given an algebraic object such as a topological space or an $R\dash$module $A$, an **ascending filtration** on $A$ is a sequence of subobjects indexed by $\NN$, $\theset{A_i}_{i\in \NN}$, satisfying $i \leq j \implies A_i \subseteq A_j$ and $\bigcup_{i\in \NN}A_i = A$. In many cases, $A_0$ is taken to be the empty set, and the filtration is often written as a chain

$$\emptyset = A_0 \subseteq A_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq A$$

It is also helpful to introduce the notation $F^i A = A_i$ to help track indices, yielding

$$\emptyset = F^0A \subseteq F^1A \subseteq \ldots \subseteq A$$


A descending filtration on $A$ is defined dually, where one instead requires $i \leq j \implies A_j \subseteq A_i$, $\bigcap_{i\in \NN} A_i = \emptyset$, and defines $A_0 = A$. This is also written as the chain

$$A \supseteq A_0 \supseteq A_1 \supseteq \ldots \supseteq \emptyset$$

where $F^i A = A_i$ is defined similarly yielding

$$A \supseteq F^0A \supseteq F^1A \supseteq \ldots \supseteq \emptyset$$

A good example of a descending filtration to keep in mind is filtering a finite-dimensional CW-complex $X$, where we define $F^iX = X^{(i)}$ to be the $i$-skeleton of $X$. Supposing that $X$ is $n\dash$dimensional, one can set $F^iX = 0$ for $i\geq n$ to obtain a bounded filtration of the following form

$$X = F^0X \supseteq F^1X \supseteq \ldots \supseteq F^nX \supseteq F^{n+1}X$$

In both cases, an object $A$ with a filtration $F$ is often abbreviated $F^\wait A$.

Given a descending filtration, one can define its **associated graded** object $G^\wait A$ as

$$G^i A = \frac{F^i A}{F^{i+1} A} = \frac{A_i}{A_{i+1}}$$

which yields the short exact sequence

$$0 \mapsvia{} A_{i+1} \mapsvia{} A_i \mapsvia{} G^i A \mapsvia{} 0$$

A **filtered chain complex** is a chain complex $(C^\wait, d)$ along with a filtration on each $n$-chain $F^\wait C_n$, such that $d^n(F^i C_n) \subseteq F^iC_{n+1}$ and the differential preserves the filtration.

Back to our original problem of computing $h^*(C^\wait)$, the method we will use will be to introduce a descending filtration $F^\wait(C^\wait)$ on the complex, usually assumed to be of finite length and written

$$C^\wait = F^0C^\wait \supseteq F^1C^\wait \supseteq \ldots \supseteq F^{k-1}C^\wait \supseteq F^kC^\wait = 0$$

With such a filtration in hand, we then take the associated graded chain complex
$$G^p C^\wait = \frac{F^pC^\wait}{F^{p+1}C^\wait}$$

As usual, one can define the homology of $C^\wait$ by taking kernels modulo images on the original chain complex, yielding $h^i(C^\wait) = \frac{\ker d^i}{\im d^{i-1}}$. However, since $F^pC^\wait \subseteq C^\wait$ and each differential $d^i:C^i \to C^{i-1}$ is defined on $C^\wait$, we can restrict these differentials to obtain differentials on the filtered complex

$$\restrictionof{d^i}{F^pC^\wait}: F^pC^i \to F^pC^{i-1}$$

and ...

This allows us to define the cohomology of the associated graded complex,

$$h^i(G^pC^\wait) = h^i(\frac{F^pC^\wait}{F^{p+1}C^\wait})$$

At this point, it is worth noting that a priori, we do not have any reason to suspect that the cohomology of the associated graded complex will be related to the cohomology of the complex we started with. Generically, forming the associated graded complex is a rather destructive process -- for example, given an arbitrary $R\dash$module $M$ with a filtration $F^\wait M$, the naive hope might be that $M \cong  \bigoplus G^p M$. However, this is generally **false** -- one is only guaranteed that there exists a collection of short exact sequences

$$0 \mapsvia{} F^{i+1}M \mapsvia{} F^{i}M \mapsvia{} G^i M \mapsvia{} 0$$

and thus this hope will only hold if and only if each short exact sequence splits. This may occur if each module is a vector space, or more generally if all of the constituent modules are free or $R$ is a principle ideal domain. Moreover, even if these sequences split, there may be multiple non-isomorphic extensions.


Definition: Associated Graded


## Results
We are thus in a position to state a theorem that will serve as our main computational tool.

### **Theorem**: The Serre Spectral Sequence

Let $F \to E \to B$ be a fibration, where $B$ is the base space, $E$ is the total space, and $F$ is the fiber. Then there exists a convergent spectral sequence

$$E_2^{i,j} = H^p(B; H^q(F; \ZZ)) \Rightarrow H^{p+q}(E; \ZZ)$$

equipped with a differential of bigrade $(r, -r+1)$, which collapses at the second page and converges to the _total cohomology_ of $E$ -- that is, the associated graded complex of the total cohomology is given by

$$G^n(K) = \bigoplus_{i+j = n} E_\infty^{i, j}$$


### Recovering the Cohomology
There is a decreasing filtration of length $k$ given by
$$H^n(E) = A^s \supseteq A^{s-1} \supseteq ~\ldots~ \supseteq A^{s-k} \supseteq A^{s-(k+1)} = 0$$

along with a collection of short exact sequences of the following form:
$$
\begin{CD}
0       @>>> A^s     @>{\sim}>> H^n(E)  @>>> 0\\
        @.           @.           @.                           @.            @. \\
0       @>>> A^{s-1} @>>> A^s     @>>> E^{s, n-s}_\infty       @>>> 0\\
        @.           @.           @.                           @.            @. \\
0       @>>> A^{s-2} @>>> A^{s-1} @>>> E^{s-1, n-(s-1)}_\infty @>>> 0\\
        @.           @.           @.                           @.            @. \\
\vdots  @.   \vdots  @.   \vdots  @.   \vdots                  @.   \vdots\\
        @.           @.           @.                           @.            @. \\
0       @>>> A^{s-k}   @>>> A^{s-k+1} @>>> E^{s-k+1, n-(s-k+1)}_\infty @>>> 0\\
        @.           @.           @.                           @.            @. \\
        @.   0       @>>> A^{s-k}     @>{\sim}>> E^{s-k, n-(s-k)}_\infty       @>>> 0\\
\end{CD}
$$

Supposing for instance that all of the modules involved are in fact free groups, each short exact sequence will split and we will have $A^i \cong A^{i-1} \oplus E^{i, n-i}$. Continuing inductively would yield $$A^s = \bigoplus_{i=1}^{s-1} E^{i, n-i}$$

and thus in this instance, the cohomology of the total space $H^n(E)$ can be recovered from its associated graded pieces.

# A Review

Roughly speaking, a spectral sequence is a system for keeping tracking of collections of exact sequences with maps between them.

Recall the Snake Lemma: given $A,B,C$ chain complexes fitting into a short exact sequence
$$ 0 \mapsvia{} A \mapsvia{i} B \mapsvia{p} C \mapsvia{} 0$$

there is a canonical long exact sequence in homology
$$ \cdots \mapsvia{} H_n(A) \mapsvia{i_*} H_n(B) \mapsvia{p_*} H_n(C) \mapsvia{\delta} H_{n-1}(A) \mapsvia{} \cdots$$

where $\delta$ is the "connecting homomorphism".


Now specialize to the case where $A_*$ is a chain complex, $B_* \subset A_*$ is a subcomplex, and consider the quotient $A_*/B_*$. We have a short exact sequence
$$ 0 \mapsvia{} B_* \mapsvia{i} A_* \mapsvia{p} A_*/B_* \mapsvia{} 0$$

Applying the snake lemma yields the long exact sequence in homology

$$\dots \mapsvia{} H_n(B_*) \mapsvia{i_*} H_n(A_*) \mapsvia{p_*} H_n(A_*/B_*) \mapsvia{\delta} H_{n-1}(B_*) \mapsvia{} \cdots$$

where $\delta$ is defined in the following way:

Given an arbitrary class $\alpha \in H_n(A_*/B_*)$, pick a representative $x \in A_*$ so that $\alpha = [x]$. Since $\del x \in B_*$, we can define
$\del(\alpha) = \del([x]) \definedas [\del x] \in H_{n-1}(B)$.

Supposing that the computation of the homologies for the subcomplex $B_*$ and the quotient complex $A_*/B_*$ are tractable, we can break this long exact sequence up into a collection of short exact sequences
$$ 0 \mapsvia{} \coker \delta \mapsvia{} H_i(A_*) \mapsvia{} \ker \delta \mapsvia{} 0 $$

This yields the following procedure for computing $H_i(A_*)$:

1. Compute $H_i(B_*)$ and $H_i(A_*/B_*)$
2. Look at the two term chain complex $H_i(A_*/B_*) \mapsvia{\delta} H_{i-1}(B_*)$
   1. Take its homology, yielding $G_1H_i$ and $G_2H_i$
3. Solve the extension problem for the short exact sequence $0 \mapsvia{} G_0H_i \mapsvia{} H_i(A_*) \mapsvia{}G_1H_i \mapsvia{} 0$



## Filtrations

A *filtered $R$-module* is an $R$-module $A$ with a sequence of submodules $\theset{A_i}_{i\in \ZZ}$ such that $A_i \subset A_{i+1}$ and $\union_\ZZ A_i = A$. Due to onerous index juggling, we write $A_i = F_i A$.

A good example of this is a CW-complex $X$, where $F_iX$ is the $i$-skeleton of $X$.

Given such a filtration, we can define an *associated graded module* $B$ where $B_i = A_{i}/ A_{i-1}$. This can yield a short exact sequence
$0 \mapsvia{} A_{i-1} \mapsvia{} A_i \mapsvia{} B_i \mapsvia{} 0$

A *filtered chain complex* is a chain complex $(C_*, \del)$ along with a filtration on each $n$-chain, $\theset{F_iC_n}_{i\in\ZZ}$, such that $\del (F_i C_n) \subseteq F_iC_{n-1}$ (i.e. the differential preserves the filtration).

Possible example: Compute Serre spectral sequences with $\FF_p$ coefficients.

# Example

The most basic example is a spectral sequence is $E^r_{p,q}$, where $r$ denotes the page of the spectral sequence and the $E_{p,q}$ is a bigraded collection of abelian groups. Furthermore, we can take a "first quadrant" sequence, where only the $p>0, q>0$ terms are nontrivial. The differentials are then defined on any given page as a "shift map" that translates $p+r$ horizontal indices and $q-(r-1)$ vertical indices (direction depends on indexing vs. "coindexing"). Here is an example of an $r=2$ page:

![SpectralSequence](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/SpectralSequence_1000.gif)

In this case, $\lim_{r\rightarrow \infty} E^r_{p,q}$ stabilizes for any given $(p,q)$ term, so we define it as $E^\infty_{p,q}$.

# A 2 Step Filtration

## Goal

We want to explicitly consider all of the objects, maps, and differentials in a particular spectral sequence arising from a space that admits a filtration that terminates in two steps. There are several concrete examples that should fit into this framework:

- $0 \injects S^k \injects S^n$ for any $k < n$
- $0 \injects S^n \injects \CP^n$
- $0 \injects \RP^n \injects S^n$
  - Using $S^n$ as a double cover of $\RP^n$



## Setup: Space and Filtration

Let $X$ be a space and let $A\subset X$ be a subspace, inducing the inclusion $A\mapsvia{i} X$, so we have the following inclusions of spaces:

$$0 \injects A \injects B$$

Then consider applying the "chain functor" $C_*(\cdot): \textbf{Top} \into \textbf{Ab}$ that sends a space $X$ to a singular chain complex
$$C_*(X) \definedas \cdots \mapsvia{\del_{i-1}} C_i(X) \mapsvia{\del_i} C_{i+1}(X) \mapsvia{\del_{i+1}} \cdots$$

Applying this functor to the above inclusion induces an inclusion of chain complexes:

$0 \injects C_*(A) \injects C_*(X)$

We regard this as a two step filtration on $C^*(X)$ by making the following identifications:

- $F_0C_*(X) \definedas C_*(X)$
- $F_1C_*(X) \definedas C_*(A)$
- $F_2C_*(X) \definedas 0$

And we obtain the primary object of interest for this spectral sequence:

$0 = F_2C_*(X) \injects F_1C_*(X) \injects F_0C_*(X) = C_*(X)$



This process is roughly summarized in the following diagram:
$$
\begin{CD}
0 @>>\injects> A @>i>\injects> X \\
@VVV @VVC_*(\cdot)V @VVV\\
0 @>>\injects> C_*(A) @>i_*>\injects> C_*(X)\\
@| @| @|\\
F_2C_*(X) @>>\injects> F_1C_*(X) @>i_*>\injects> F_0C_*(X)
\end{CD}
$$

# Setup: Spectral Sequence

A few definitions to recall:

$G_iC_*(X) \definedas \frac{F_iC_*(X)}{F_{i+1}C_*(X)}$

$E_0^{p,q} = G_pC_{p+q}(X)$

$E_1^{p,q} = H(E_0^{p,q}, d_0)$

# Computation of Pages

## $E_{-1}$

Not standard usage, here I consider the "$E_{-1}$ page" to be simply a presentation of the double complex itself. The formula works out to be something like
$E_{-1}^{p,q} = F_pC_q(X)$

$$
\begin{array}{l:r|cccc}
q= n &\hspace{4em} 0 & F_0C_n(X) &  F_1C_n(X) &  F_2C_n(X) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
q=3 &0 &  F_0C_3(X) & F_1C_3(X) &  F_2C_3(X) \\
q=2 &0 &  F_0C_2(X) & F_1C_2(X) &  F_2C_2(X) \\
q=1 &0 & F_0C_1(X) & F_1C_1(X) &  F_2C_1(X) \\
q=0 &0 & F_0C_0(X) &  F_1C_0(X) & F_2C_0(X) \\
\hline \\
q=-1 &0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
q-2 &0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\\\hdashline\\
p = -2 & p=-1& p=0 & p=1 & p=2 \\
\end{array}
$$



For clarity, we unpack definitions here to show how the actual original chain complexes sit inside of this page:
$$
\begin{array}{l:r|cccc}
q= n &\hspace{4em} 0 & C_n(X) &  C_n(A) &  0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
q=3 &0 &  C_3(X) & C_3(A) &  0 \\
q=2 &0 &  C_2(X) & C_2(A) &  0 \\
q=1 &0 & C_1(X) & C_1(A) &  0 \\
q=0 &0 & C_0(X) &  C_0(A) & 0 \\
\hline \\
q=-1 &0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
q-2 &0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\\\hdashline\\
p = -2 & p=-1& p=0 & p=1 & p=2 \\
\end{array}
$$

Focusing on the area $p,q >= -1$, we use the fact that the chain complexes come with natural boundary maps to define the differentials $d_{-1}\definedas \del_n: C_n(X) \into C_{n-1}(X)$.
$$

\end{CD}
$$


## $E_0$

Here we use the following formulas/facts:

- $G_iC_*(X) \definedas \frac{F_iC_*(X)}{F_{i+1}C_*(X)}$
- $E_0^{p,q} \definedas G_pC_{p+q}(X)$
- $C_n(X, A) \definedas \frac{C_n(X)}{C_n(A)}$
  - This can be done because there is a SES
    $0 \into C_*(A) \into C_*(X) \into \frac{C_*(X)}{C_*(A)} \into 0$
    Then since $\del_n : C_n(X) \into C_{n-1}(X)$ has the property that $\del_n(C_*(A)) = C_*(A)$, it factors through the quotient $\frac{C_*(X)}{C_*(A)}$ to yield a map $\hat\del_n: \frac{C_n(X)}{C_n(A)} \into \frac{C_{n-1}(X)}{C_{n-1}(A)}$. Shorten notation by calling $\frac{C_*(X)}{C_*(A)} \definedas C_*(X, A)$ the relative chain complex; this yields relative homology with respect to $\hat\del$, i.e. $H_n(X,A) \definedas \frac{\ker \del_n}{\im \del_{n+1}} \subset C_n(X, A)$.

which explicitly yields
$$
G_0C_*(X) = \frac{F_0C_*(X)}{F_1C_*(X)} = \frac{C_*(X)}{C_*(A)} \definedas C_*(X, A) \\
G_1C_*(X) = \frac{F_1C_*(X)}{F_2C_*(X)} = \frac{C_*(A)}{ 0 } = C_*(A) \\
G_2C_*(X) = \frac{0}{0} = 0

# Spectral Sequence of a Serre Fibration 

The standard Serre fibration: $\Omega X \into PX \mapsvia{f} X$ where $\Omega X$ is the loop space, $PX$ is the path space, and $f$ is the "evaluation at the endpoint" map. Note that $PX$ is contractible!

Consider a SES $0 \to A \to B \to C \to C$, then look at it as a 2-step filtration of $B$ so 

- $F^0B = B$, 
- $F^1B = A$,
- $F^2B = 0$. 

The sections are $G_0 = C, G_1 = A$. Can use this to obtain LES from SS.

Homology in the ring-theoretic setting: If $R$ is a Noetherian ring and $I \subseteq R$, then if $I$ can be generated by $n$ elements then $H_I^i(M) = 0$ for any $R$-module $M$ and $i > n$. Thus to prove $I$ can *not* be generated by $n$ elements, it suffices to find a module $M$ where $H_I^{n+1} \neq 0$.


## Other Fibrations

Lots of good examples of computations [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serre_spectral_sequence)

Some fibrations

- Hopf: $S^1 \into S^3 \into S^2$
- $S^1 \into S^{2n+1} \into \CP^n$
- Path space: $\Omega S^n \into PS^n \into S^n$

# Spectral Sequence of a Filtration

Suppose we are given a chain complex $(C^\wait, d^\wait)$ and we want to compute its homology. We assume that $C^{<0} = 0$ (where we use homological indexing and $d^\wait$ is of degree $-1$) along with an ascending, bounded filtration $F^\wait C^\wait$ which can be written as

$$0 =F^0C^\wait \subseteq F^1C^\wait \subseteq \ldots \subseteq F^{p-1}C^\wait \subseteq F^pC^\wait = C^\wait$$

and satisfies $\bigcup_{i} F^i C^\wait = C^\wait$ and $\bigcap_{i} C^\wait = \theset{0}$.

Then take the associated graded complex, defined by

$$
G^i C^\wait = \frac{F^i C^\wait}{F^{i-1} C^\wait}
$$

This yields a collection of short exact sequences of the form
$$
0 \to F^{i-1} C^\wait \to F^i C^\wait \to G^i C^\wait \to 0
$$

We now verify three facts:

1. Each $F^i C^\wait$ is a chain complex (restrict the differential).
2. Each $G^i C^\wait$ is a chain complex (differential well-defined on quotient).
3. $F^\wait$ induces a filtration on $H_*(C^\wait)$, which we'll denote $F^\wait H_*(C^\wait)$.

Given the induced filtration on homology, we can take its associated graded complex:

$$
F^i H_j(C^\wait) = \frac{?}{?} = \theset{\alpha \in H_j(C^\wait) \mid \alpha = [x] \text{ for some } x \in F^iC^j}
$$

Which yields a collection of short exact sequences
$$ 0 \to F^{i-1}H_j(C^\wait) \to F^iH_j(C^\wait) \to G^iH_j(C^\wait) \to 0$$

And since $F^pC^\wait = C^\wait$, we have $F^pH_j(C^\wait) = H_j(C^\wait)$. Assuming all sequences split and all extensions are unique, we can rewrite the left hand side:

$$
\begin{align}
F^pH_j(C^\wait) &= F^{p-1}H_j(C^\wait) \oplus G^pH_j(C^\wait) \\
&= F^{p-2}H_j(C^\wait) \oplus G^{p-1}H_j(C^\wait) \oplus G^pH_j(C^\wait) \\
&\cdots \\
&= \bigoplus_{0\leq i \leq p}G^iH_j(C^\wait)
\end{align}
$$

So if we are able to compute each $G^iH_j(C^\wait)$, we can recover the desired homology.

We proceed by computing $H_j(G^i C^\wait)$ instead, which we hope will be related to $G^i H_j (C^\wait)$.


By an earlier argument, we know that there exists induced differentials on the associated graded complex

$$
d_{i,j}: G^i C^j \to G^{i} C^{j-1}
$$

We thus build the 0 page of our spectral sequence by defining

$$E^0_{p,q} = G^p C^{p+q}$$

with a defined differential

$$d^0_{i,j}: E^0_{i,j} \to E^0_{i-1, j}$$

and arranging these in columns, yielding the following situation

![Page 0 with differentials](figures/SSFiltrationStack.png)

Now, since each $G^i C^\wait$ is a chain complex, we can take the homology with respect to these differentials, so we define

$$
E^1_{i,j} = \frac
{\ker\left( d^0_{i,j}: E^0_{i,j} \to E^0_{i-1, j} \right)}
{\im \left(d^0_{i+1,j}: E^0_{i+1,j} \to E^0_{i,j} \right)} \definedas H_{i+j}(G^i C^\wait)
$$

Which yields the following $E^1$ page:

![Page 0 with differentials](figures/SSFiltrationStackP1.png)

Which by definition is

![Page 0 with differentials](figures/SSFiltrationStackP1Homology.png)

We now claim that there is a differential

$$
d_1^{i,j}: H_n(G^i C^\wait) \to H_{n-1}(G^{i-1}C^\wait)
$$

## Example: Proving the Snake Lemma without chasing elements

Given the following diagram, with exact rows and commuting squares:![Capture](../../zettelkasten/figures/Capture%201.png)

We want to show that this sequence is exact:

$$ 0 \mapsvia{} \ker \alpha \mapsvia{} \ker \beta \mapsvia{} \ker\gamma \mapsvia{\delta} \im\alpha \mapsvia{} \im\beta \mapsvia{}\im\gamma \mapsvia{} 0$$

The usual proof involves pushing around elements - all of the maps are "obvious", except for $\delta$.

#anabelian

> I think the whole field of anabelian geometry fits the bill, even if it's perhaps more focused on going the other way around (i.e. applying homotopy theory to number theory). Anabelian geometry is a 'program' launched by Grothendieck in his famous Esquisse d'un Programme, and is all about translating arithmetic geometric problems to problems in homotopy theory.

> As an example of a specific instance of the anabelian philosophy, we have Grothendieck's celebrated 'section conjecture', which states (in one form) that for a 'nice' curve X over a number field F, the rational points are in bijection with the sections of the exact sequence
$$
1 \rightarrow \pi_1(X_{\bar{F}}) \rightarrow \pi_1(X) \rightarrow G_F \rightarrow 1
$$
where GF is the absolute Galois group of F and π1 is the algebraic (etale) fundamental group. In case the curve is over the complex numbers, the etale π1 is the profinite completion of the regular fundamental group, so there is a very close connection to the classical stuff of Hatcher. The conjecture is still a wide open problem, but any proof would mean you could check something of number theoretic interest (existence of rational points on curves) by studying maps between certain generalized homotopy groups!

# Schoenflies Problem

A sharpening of Jordan curve theorem. It states that not only does every simple closed curve in the plane separate the plane into two regions, one (the "inside") bounded and the other (the "outside") unbounded; but also that these two regions are homeomorphic to the inside and outside of a standard circle in the plane.

We have the following situation: a fiber bundle

$$
K(\pi, n) \to E \to B
$$

Where we might assume that $B$ is connected for simplicity.

# Classification

1. $\pi_1(B)$ acts on the fiber by self-homotopy equivalences, i.e. maps

$$
\pi_1(B) \to Aut(K(\pi, n)) \cong Aut(\pi),
$$

where the second equivalence is just a consequence of the simplicity of these spaces, i.e. its single homotopy group.

*Note: usually we are assuming that this action is **trivial**; otherwise, accounting for it makes things more complicated.*

2. Assuming that $\pi_1(B) = 0$, or equivalently that the above action is trivial, then isomorphism classes of these bundles correspond to certain cohomology elements. In particular, we have

$$
\theset{\text{isomorphism classes of bundles } K(\pi, n)\to E\to B}
\iff H^{n+1}(B; \pi)
$$

In general, the right hand side of this correspondence is referred to as cohomology *"with twisted coefficients"* in the *"bundle of groups"* $\pi \to G \to B$.

Why?

- Every $K(\pi, n)$ fibration is a pullback of the universal one, i.e.

$$
\begin{CD}
@. @.  \Omega K(\pi, n+1) = K(\pi, n)\\
@. @. @VVV \\
K(\pi, n) @>>> E = f^* PK(\pi, n+1) @>>> PK(\pi, n+1) \simeq \pt\\
@. @V{p}VV @V{p'}VV \\
@. B @>{f}>> K(\pi, n+1) \\
\end{CD}
$$

and so we can think of the universal bundle as the "classifying space for the $K(\pi, n)$" bundle here.

We can also explicitly construct $f^* E = \theset{x, (p^{-1}\circ f)(x)}$.

- The universal bundle $K(\pi, n) \to PK(\pi, n+1) \to K(\pi, n+1)$ gives rise to a canonical element in

$$
H^{n+1}(K(\pi, n+1); \pi) \cong \hom(H_{n+1} (K(\pi, n+1), \pi) = \Hom(\pi, \pi) = \Aut(\pi)
$$

by the universal coefficient theorem, where $\ext$ disappears since $H_{<n+1}K(\pi, n) = 0$.

The group $Aut(\pi)$ a natural identity element, namely the identity automorphism, and so we define the corresponding element in cohomology to be the *characteristic class* of the bundle.

Thus, given any $f$ fitting into the following situation

$$
\begin{CD}
K(\pi, n) @>>> PK(\pi, n+1) \\
@. @VVV \\
X @>{f}>> K(\pi, n+1)
\end{CD}
$$

we can form $f^*C \in H^{n+1}(X; \pi)$.

**Remark**: Note that this gives us an alternative definition of cohomology in terms of homotopy, using the correspondence $$[X, K(\pi, n)] \cong H^n(X; \pi)$$.

**Claim**: This correspondence yields the desired isomorphism.

Motto for homology: kernel of what's going out mod image of what's coming in

Easy definition: A *spectral sequence* is the data $\{(E_r, d_r)\}_{r\in\ZZ}$ where each $E_r$ is an abelian group, $d_r: E_r \into E_r$ is a homomorphism satisfying $d_r^2=0$, and $E_{r+1} \cong \frac{\ker d_r}{\im d_r}$.

Another definition: a *homological spectral sequence* is a sequence of $\ZZ$-bigraded modules $\{E^r_{p,q}\}_{r > 0}$ with differentials $d_r: E^r_{p,q} \into E^r_{p-r, q+(r-1)}$ such that $E^{r+1} = H_*(E^r)$.

A *cohomological spectral sequence* is the same, except $d_r: E_r^{p,q} \into E_r^{p+r, q-(r-1)}$

The 'lines' with slope $-\frac{r-1}{r}$ form chain complexes.

Define cycles to be $Z_i \definedas \ker d_i$, boundaries to be $B_i: \im d_i$.

Concrete examples for pages:

$r=1$: Differential is $d_1:E^1_{p,q} \into E^1_{p-1, q}$

$r=2$: Differential is $d_2:E^2_{p,q} \into E^2_{p-2, q+1}$

​	Equivalently, $d_2: H_*(E^1_{p,q}) \into H_*(E^1_{p-1, q})$?

$r=3$: Differential is $d_3: E^3_{p,q} \into E^3_{p-3,q+2}$

Should be able to compute the cohomology rings of fiber bundles $E \mapsvia{f} B$ pretty easily, using the map induced by the cup product $E_r^{i,j} \cross E_r^{k,l} \into E_r^{i+k, j+l}$ and the fact that $E_2^{i,j} = H^i(B, H^j(F)) \Rightarrow H^{i+j}(E, \QQ)$. (For example, try $SO_{n-1} \into SO_n \into S^{n-1}$)

How to put a filtration in the $E^1$ page: ?

Any complex with a two step filtration $F_1 \subset F_0 = K$ is exactly the long exact arising from $0 \injects F^1 \injects F_0 \surjects \frac{F_1}{F_0} \surjects 0$.

Next simplest example: a three step filtration $F_2 \subset F_1 \subset F_0 = K$. Write down all of the short exact sequences, and relate $H^*(K)$ to $H^*(\frac{F^i}{F^{i+1}})$.

### Recovering the homology

If a spectral sequence collapses, say $E_\infty^{p,q} = E_N^{p,q}$, then $H_n(X)$ is the unique $E_N^{p,q}$ where $p+q=n$. In general, the homology can be read off as the single nonzero element on the diagonal when this happens.

# Principal Bundles

A principal bundle is a mathematical object that formalizes some of the essential features of the Cartesian product $X × G$ of a space $X$ with a group $G$. In the same way as with the Cartesian product, a principal bundle $P$ is equipped with

An action of $G$ on $P$, analogous to $(x, g)h = (x, gh)$ for a product space.
A projection onto $X$. For a product space, this is just the projection onto the first factor, $(x,g) ↦ x$.

A principal $G$-bundle, where $G$ denotes any topological group, is a fiber bundle $π:P → X$ together with a continuous right action $P × G → P$ such that $G$ preserves the fibers of $P$ (i.e. if $y ∈ P_x$ then $yg ∈ P_x$ for all $g ∈ G$) and acts freely and transitively on them. This implies that each fiber of the bundle is homeomorphic to the group $G$ itself.

Since the group action preserves the fibers of $π:P → X$ and acts transitively, it follows that the orbits of the $G$-action are precisely these fibers and the orbit space $P/G$ is homeomorphic to the base space $X$. Because the action is free, the fibers have the structure of $G\dash$torsors. A $G$-torsor is a space which is homeomorphic to $G$ but lacks a group structure since there is no preferred choice of an identity element.

**One of the most important questions regarding any fiber bundle is whether or not it is trivial, i.e. isomorphic to a product bundle.** A principal bundle is trivial if and only if it admits a global cross section.

## Examples

The prototypical example of a smooth principal bundle is the frame bundle of a smooth manifold $M$, often denoted $FM$ or $GL(M)$. Here the fiber over a point $x ∈ M$ is the set of all frames (i.e. ordered bases) for the tangent space $T_xM$. The general linear group $GL(n,\RR)$ acts freely and transitively on these frames. These fibers can be glued together in a natural way so as to obtain a principal $GL(n,\RR)$-bundle over $M$.

A normal (regular) covering space $p:C → X$ is a principal bundle where the structure group

$$G=\pi _{1}(X)/p_* (\pi_{1}(C))$$

acts on the fibers of p via the monodromy action. In particular, the universal cover of $X$ is a principal bundle over $X$ with structure group $π_1(X)$ (since the universal cover is simply connected and thus $π_1(C)$ is trivial).

## Classification

Any topological group $G$ admits a classifying space $BG:$ the quotient by the action of $G$ of some weakly contractible space $EG$, i.e. a topological space with vanishing homotopy groups. The classifying space has the property that any $G$ principal bundle over a paracompact manifold $B$ is isomorphic to a pullback of the principal bundle $EG → BG$.

In fact, more is true, as the set of isomorphism classes of principal $G$ bundles over the base $B$ identifies with the set of homotopy classes of maps $B → BG$.

# Classifying Spaces

**Definition:** A _principal $G\dash$bundle_ is a fiber bundle $F \to E \to B$ in which for each fiber $\pi^{-1}(b)\definedas F_b$, satisfying the condition that $G$ acts freely and transitively on $F_b$. In other words, there is a continuous group action $\actson: E\cross G \to E$ such that for every $f \in F_b$ and $g\in G$, we have $g\actson f \in F_b$ and $g\actson f \neq f$.

**Example:** A covering space $\hat X \mapsvia{p} X$ yields a principal $\pi_1(X)\dash$bundle.



*Remark*: A consequence of this is that each $F_b \cong G \in \text{TopGrp}$ (which may also be taken as the definition). Furthermore, each $F_b$ is then a _homogeneous space_, i.e. a space with a transitive group action $G\actson F_b$ making $F_b \cong G/G_x$.

*Remark*: Although each fiber $F_b$ is isomorphic to $G$, there is no preferred identity element in $F_b$. Locally, one can form a local section by choosing some $e\in F_b$ to serve as the identity, but the fibers can only be given a global group structure iff the bundle is trivial. This property is expressed by saying $F_b$ is a _$G\dash$torsor_.

*Remark*: Every fiber bundle $F\to E\to B$ is a principal $\Aut(F)\dash$fiber bundle. Also, in local trivializations, the transition functions are elements of $G$.

**Proposition**: A principal bundle is trivial iff it admits a global section. Thus all principal vector bundles are trivial, since the zero section always exists.

**Definition:** A principal bundle $F \to E \mapsvia{\pi} B$ is *universal* iff $E$ is weakly contractible, i.e. if $E$ has the homotopy type of a point.

**Definition:** Given a topological group $G$, a _classifying space_, denoted $BG$, is the base space of a universal principal $G\dash$bundle
$$
G \to EG \mapsvia{\pi} BG
$$
making $BG$ a quotient of the contractible space $EG$ by a $G\dash$action. We shall refer to this as _the classifying bundle_.

Classifying spaces satisfy the property that any other principal $G\dash$bundle over a space $X$ is isomorphic to a pullback of the classifying bundle along a map $X \to BG$.


Let $I(G, X)$ denote the set of isomorphism classes of principal $G\dash$bundles over a base space $X$, then
$$
I(G, X) \cong [X, BG]_{\text{hoTop}}
$$

So in other words, isomorphism classes of principal $G\dash$bundles over a base $X$ are equivalent to homotopy classes of maps from $X$ into the classifying space of $G$.


**Proposition**: Grassmannians are classifying spaces for vector bundles. That is, there is a bijective correspondence:

$$
[X, \Gr(n, \RR)] \cong \theset{\text{isomorphism classes of rank $n$ $\RR\dash$vector bundles over $X$}}
$$

It is also the case that every such vector bundle is a pullback of the principal bundle
$$
\GL(n, \RR) \to V_n(\RR^\infty) \to \Gr(n, \RR)
$$

#spectral_sequences

# Using the Path-Loop Fibration 

In particular the classifying space $BG$ of a topological group $G$ is the solution for a fibration $BG \cross_\tau G$ where the fiber space is the given group $G$, the base space is the classifying space $BG$ and the product $BG \cross G$ is twisted in such a way the total space $BG \cross_\tau G$ is contractible. The same idea where the base space $X$ is given and the fibre space is unknown leads to the loop space $\Omega X$ and the contractible total space $X \cross_\tau \Omega X$.

The handbooks of Algebraic Topology more or less explain the Eilenberg–Moore spectral sequence can be used to “compute” the homology groups of the new objects $BG$ and $ΩX$ if the homology groups of $G$ or $X$ are known. In fact this spectral sequence is in general unable to give you the new homology groups, unless you are in a very special situation. The Serre spectral sequence works in the third situation, when you are looking for the homology groups of a total space $B \cross_\tau F$ if the homology groups of $B$ and $F$ are known; but in general you meet the same difficulties with the higher differentials and the extension problems at abutment.

In fact, by working the Serre spectral sequence backwards, we can compute the homology of $\Omega S^n$.

#homotopy #obstruction_theory #characteristic_classes

The rough idea of obstruction theory is simple. 
Suppose we want to construct some kind of function on a CW complex $X$. We do this by induction: if the
function is defined on the k-skeleton $X_k$, we try to extend it over the $(k + 1)\dash$skeleton $X^{k+1}$. The obstruction to extending over a $(k + 1)\dash$cell is an element of $\pi_k$ of something. These obstructions fit together to give a cellular cochain on $X$ with coefficients in this $π_k$. In fact this cochain is a cocycle, so it defines an “obstruction class” in $H_{k+1}(X; π_k(something))$. If this cohomology class is zero, i.e. if there is a cellular $k\dash$cochain $η$ with $0 = δη$, then $η$ prescribes a way to modify our map over the $k\dash$skeleton so that it can be extended over the $(k + 1)\dash$skeleton

# What is the difference between low and high dimensional topology?

High-dimensional topology refers to manifolds of dimension 5 and above, or in relative terms, embeddings in codimension 3 and above. Low-dimensional topology is concerned with questions in dimensions up to 4, or embeddings in codimension up to 2.

The distinction is because surgery theory works in dimension 5 and above (in fact, it works topologically in dimension 4, though this is very involved to prove), and thus the behavior of manifolds in dimension 5 and above is controlled algebraically by surgery theory. In dimension 4 and below (topologically, in dimension 3 and below), surgery theory does not work, and other phenomena occur.

The precise reason for the difference at dimension 5 is because the Whitney embedding theorem, the key technical trick which underlies surgery theory, requires 2+1 dimensions.

Low-dimensional topology is strongly geometric, as reflected in the uniformization theorem in 2 dimensions – every surface admits a constant curvature metric; geometrically, it has one of 3 possible geometries: positive curvature/spherical, zero curvature/flat, negative curvature/hyperbolic – and the geometrization theorem in 3 dimensions – every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces, each of which has one of 8 possible geometries.

#lie_groups #physics #erlangen

The universal compact lie group is the topological monoid $L(\RR^\infty, \RR^\infty)$ of linear isometric self-embeddings.

[Justification for Lie Group Computations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group#Lie_groups)
Here is a very fundamental way to create interesting Riemannian manifolds: Let $G$ be a semi-simple Lie group, let $K$ be its maximal compact subgroup, let $Γ$ be a discrete subgroup of $G$, and form $G/K$. This quotient is called the symmetric space attached to $G$.

The Riemannian structure comes from an invariant metric on $G$, and so $G$ acts as isometries on $G/K$ by left translation.

If you now take a discrete subgroup $Γ$ of $G$, you can form the double quotient $Γ∖G/K$. These are some of the most celebrated Riemannian manifolds in mathematics. In the case of $SL_2(\RR)$, we know via uniformization that all genus $g≥2$ Riemann surfaces can be described in this way. In the case of $SL_2(\CC)$ we get hyperbolic 3-manifolds, from symplectic groups we get moduli spaces of abelian varieties, ... .

P.S. I should also note that the study of spaces $Γ∖G/K$ for certain $Γ$ (so-called congruence subgroups) is one of the basic topics of the Langlands program, and the function theory and cohomology of these spaces (especially their representation-theoretic structure) is conjectured to govern a vast amount of number theory. Trying to understand and work on these conjectures was my own motivation for learning Lie theory.

[Cartan's Generalization of Klein's Erlangen Program](https://books.google.com/books?id=Ytqs4xU5QKAC&lpg=PA178&dq=cartan%2520geometry%2520sharpe&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=cartan%2520geometry%2520sharpe&f=false)

[More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan_connection)

A Klein geometry consists of a Lie group $G$ together with a Lie subgroup $H$ of $G$. Together $G$ and $H$ determine a homogeneous space $G/H$, on which the group $G$ acts by left-translation. Klein's aim was then to study objects living on the homogeneous space which were congruent by the action of $G$. A Cartan geometry extends the notion of a Klein geometry by attaching to each point of a manifold a copy of a Klein geometry, and to regard this copy as tangent to the manifold. Thus the geometry of the manifold is infinitesimally identical to that of the Klein geometry, but globally can be quite different. In particular, Cartan geometries no longer have a well-defined action of $G$ on them. However, a Cartan connection supplies a way of connecting the infinitesimal model spaces within the manifold by means of parallel transport.

- Irreducible reps of $SO_3$ describe the periodic table
- Irreducible reps of $SU_2$ lead to Dirac equations of the electron
- Standard Model: $SU_3 \cross SU_2 \cross U_1$

$SO(n)$ and its relativistic analog $SO(1,n)$ define symmetries of space time. $SU(n)$ defines fundamental quantum mechanical phase space symmetries. $Sp(n)$ defines symmetries in cases where there is a quaternionic structure.

# Introduction to $\infty\dash$Categories

> These are notes roughly transcribed from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IjAy0gHRyY)

## Preliminary Definitions

Dealing with size issues: take a Grothendieck Universe $\mathcal{U}$, which are the sets whose subsets are closed under all of the usual set operations (small).


:::{.definition title="$\infty\dash$Category"}
An $\infty\dash$category $\mathcal{C}$ is a (large) simplicial set $\mathcal{C}$ such that any diagram of the form

\begin{tikzcd}
	{\Lambda_i^n} && {\mathcal{C}} \\
	\\
	{\Delta_n}
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=3-1]
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{\exists}"', from=3-1, to=1-3, dashed]
\end{tikzcd}

admits the indicated lift, where $\Lambda_i^n$ is an $i\dash$horn (a simplex missing the $i$th face) for $0 < i < n$.
:::


:::{.remark}
This is a specialized notion of a Kan complex, and in particular all $\infty\dash$categories are Kan complexes.
All inner horns are fillable, i.e. simplicial sets are *inner* Kan complexes.
Different to Kan complexes, which include all $i$.
:::

:::{.definition title="Functors between $\infty\dash$categories"}
A **functor** between two $\infty\dash$categories is a map between simplicial sets.
:::

:::{.definition title="Nerve of a category"}
Given an ordinary category $\mathcal{C}$, define the **nerve** of $\mathcal{C}$ to be the simplicial set given by
\[  
N(\mathcal{C})_n \da \ts{\text{Functors } F: [n] \to \mathcal{C}}
\]
where $[n]$ is the poset category on $\ts{1, 2, \cdots, n}$.
So an $n\dash$simplex is a diagram of objects $X_0, \cdots, X_n \in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$ and a sequence of maps.
This defines an $\infty\dash$category, and there is a correspondence
\[  
\correspond{\text{ Functors } F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}}
&\iff
\correspond{\infty\dash\text{Functors } \hat F: N(\mathcal{C}) \to N(\mathcal{D})}
.\]
Note that taking the nerve of a category preserves the usual categorical structure, since the objects are the 0-simplices and the morphisms are the 1-simplices.
:::



:::{.remark}
For $\mathcal{C}$ an $\infty\dash$category, we can define $\mathcal{C}_0$ to be the "objects" and $\mathcal{C}_1$ to be the "morphisms", although we don't have a good notion of composition yet.
There will be boundary map: a 1-simplex has two boundary points, i.e. two objects $a, b \in \mathcal{C}_0$, so we can think of this as a map $f: a\to b$ where $a = \del_1 f, b= \del_0 f$[^on_bd_notation]
are the first and second vertices respectively.
We'll also have "degeneracy" maps going up from $\mathcal{C}_0 \to \mathcal{C}_1$, which we should think of as assigning identity morphisms to objects, or conversely that the identity morphism is the degenerate 1-simplex at an object.

[^on_bd_notation]: This notation $\bd_i$ denotes the boundary operator that drops the $i$th vertex. 

:::

## Equivalences

:::{.definition title="Equivalence of Morphisms"}
Given two morphisms $f, g: a\to b$ in an $\infty\dash$category, we say $f\homotopic g$ are **equivalent** iff there is a 2-simplex filling in the following diagram:

\begin{tikzcd}
    && {b}  \\
    &&      \\
{a} && {b}
\arrow["{\id_b}", from=1-3, to=3-3]
\arrow["{f}"{name=0}, from=3-1, to=1-3]
\arrow["{g}"', from=3-1, to=3-3]
\arrow[Rightarrow, from=0, to=3-3, shorten <=4pt, shorten >=4pt]
\end{tikzcd}
[Link to diagram](https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMyxbMCwyLCJhIl0sWzIsMCwiYiJdLFsyLDIsImIiXSxbMSwyLCJcXGlkX2IiXSxbMCwxLCJmIl0sWzAsMiwiZyIsMl0sWzQsMiwiIiwwLHsibGVuZ3RoIjo3MH1dXQ==)

:::

:::{.remark}
This turns out to be an equivalence relation.
Note that in an ordinary category, if two morphisms are equivalent then they are already equal.
:::

:::{.definition title="Composition of morphisms"}
For 1-simplices $f: a\to b, g:b\to c$, a **composition** of $f$ and $g$ is a 2-simplex $\sigma$ filling in the following diagram:
\begin{tikzcd}
	&& {b} \\
	\\
	{a} &&&& {c}
	\arrow["{f}", from=3-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{g}", from=1-3, to=3-5]
	\arrow["{\exists h}"' {name=0, inner sep=0}, from=3-1, to=3-5, dotted]
	\arrow[Rightarrow, from=0, to=1-3, shorten <=6pt, shorten >=6pt, "\sigma"]
\end{tikzcd}
[Link to diagram](https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMyxbMCwyLCJhIl0sWzQsMiwiYyJdLFsyLDAsImIiXSxbMCwyLCJmIl0sWzIsMSwiZyJdLFswLDFdLFs1LDIsIiIsMCx7Imxlbmd0aCI6NzB9XV0=)

In this case, $h \da \bd_1 \sigma$ and we write $h \homotopic g\circ f$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Note that we're not fixing a choice, but it is well-defined up to the equivalence relation we're using.
This is similar to how e.g. coproducts are not baked into the structure of a category, but are instead only well-defined up to canonical isomorphism -- and in fact, this characterization is sometimes preferable.

:::{.definition title="Equivalences of objects"}
If $f: a\to b$ is a morphism in an $\infty\dash$category $\mathcal{C}$, then we say $f$ is an **equivalence** if there exists a morphism $g:b\to a$ such that $\id_a \homotopic g\circ f$ and $\id_b \homotopic f\circ g$.
This is equivalent to finding 2-simplices $\sigma, \sigma'$ that fill the following two diagrams:


\begin{tikzcd}
	&& {b} \\
	&&&&& {} \\
	{a} && {a} && {b}
	\arrow["{f}"{name=0}, from=3-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{\exists g}", from=1-3, to=3-3, dashed]
	\arrow["{\id_a}"', from=3-1, to=3-3]
	\arrow["{\id_b}"{name=1}, from=1-3, to=3-5]
	\arrow["{\exists g}", from=3-5, to=3-3, dashed]
	\arrow[Rightarrow, "{\sigma}"', from=0, to=3-3, shorten <=4pt, shorten >=4pt]
	\arrow[Rightarrow, "{\sigma'}", from=1, to=3-3, shorten <=4pt, shorten >=4pt]
\end{tikzcd}

:::

:::{.remark}
This is close to what we'd require for an isomorphism in an ordinary category, but we now allow the compositions to only be "weakly equivalent" or homotopic to the identities.
:::

:::{.definition title="Functor Categories"}
For $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D}$ simplicial sets, we can define a simplicial set $\Fun(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D})$ whose $n\dash$simplices are given by
\[  
\Fun(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D})_n \da \ts{ \text{Simplicial maps } F: \mathcal{C} \cross \Delta^n \to \mathcal{D}}
.\]
:::

:::{.remark}
Note that the 0-simplices recover functors if these are ordinary categories.
If $\mathcal{D}$ is an $\infty\dash$category, then this functor category is again an $\infty\dash$category.

:::

:::{.definition title="Morphisms of functors / natural transformations"}
A **morphism** in $\Fun(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D})$, say $\eta: F\to G$, is a functor $\eta: C\cross \Delta^n \to \mathcal{D}$ such that
\[  
\ro{\eta}{\mathcal{C} \cross \ts{0}} &= F \\
\ro{\eta}{\mathcal{C} \cross \ts{1}} &= G
.\]
We call such an $\eta$ a **natural transformation** from $F$ to $G$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Being an equivalence in $\Fun(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D})$ is equivalent to being a pointwise equivalence.
I.e., $\eta$ is an equivalence iff the map $\eta_{{C}}$ given by partially applying an object of $\mathcal{C}$ (i.e. a 1-simplex $\Delta^n \to \mathcal{D}$) is an equivalence in $\mathcal{D}$ for all objects $C\in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$.
:::

:::{.definition title="Equivalences of $\infty\dash$categories"}
A functor $f:\mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{D}$ of $\infty\dash$categories is an **equivalence** iff there exists a functor $g: \mathcal{D}\to \mathcal{C}$ and natural equivalences
\[  
f\circ g &\mapsvia{\sim} \id_{\mathcal{D}} \\
g\circ f &\mapsvia{\sim} \id_{\mathcal{C}} 
.\]
If there exists such an equivalence, we will write $\mathcal{C}\homotopic \mathcal{D}$.
:::

:::{.remark}
For ordinary categories, there is a characteristic property that is much easier to write down in general than an explicit equivalence, namely being essentially surjective and fully faithful.
We need the notion of mapping spaces to make that precise here.
:::

## Composition

:::{.definition title="Mapping Spaces"}
For $a, b\in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$, we define a simplicial set $\Map_{\mathcal{C}}(a, b)$ as the following pullback:

\begin{tikzcd}
	{\Map_{\mathcal{C}}(a, b)} && {\Fun(\Delta^1, \mathcal{C})} \\
	& {} \\
	{\Delta^0} && {\mathcal{C} \cross \mathcal{C}}
	\arrow["{(f, g)}", from=1-3, to=3-3]
	\arrow["{(a, b)}"', from=3-1, to=3-3]
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=3-1, dashed]
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-3, dashed]
	\arrow["\lrcorner"{very near start, rotate=0}, from=1-1, to=2-2, phantom]
\end{tikzcd}

:::

:::{.remark}
Here we use the fact if $F\in \Fun(\Delta^1, \mathcal{C})$, this data includes two maps $f, g: \Delta^0 \to \mathcal{C}$ given by restricting to the two vertices of $\Delta^1$.
This allows us to define a map $(f, g)$ into $\mathcal{C}^2$.
In that product, we also have the point $a, b$, which allows defining the bottom map $(a, b)$.

Also note that if $\mathcal{C}$ is in fact an $\infty\dash$category, then $\Map_{\mathcal{C}}(a, b)$ is a Kan complex.
The 0-simplices in it are precisely the morphisms in $\Fun(\Delta^n, \mathcal{C})$ with endpoints $a, b$, and there is a filling 1-simplex between any two such morphisms iff they are equivalent.
We can thus conclude that
\[  
\pi_0 \Map_{\mathcal{C}}(a, b) = \ts{\text{Equivalence classes of morphism } f:a\to b}
.\]
:::

:::{.definition title="Fully Faithful"}
A functor $f: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is **fully faithful** the induced maps
\[  
f_*: \Map_{\mathcal{C}}(a, b) \to \Map_{\mathcal{D}}(f(a), f(b))
\]
is a homotopy equivalence of Kan complexes for all pairs of objects $a, b\in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Note that this does imply bijections on (equivalence classes) of morphisms in hom sets, i.e. on $\pi_0$, but in general this is much more because we are requiring an induced isomorphism on all higher homotopy groups as well.
:::

:::{.warnings}
This is not something that can easily be checked on *just* morphisms.
:::

:::{.definition title="Essentially Surjective"}
A functor $f:\mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{D}$ is **essentially surjective** iff for every $d\in \mathcal{D}$, there exists an object $c\in \mathcal{C}$ and an equivalence $d \homotopic f(c)$.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Characterization of equivalence of $\infty\dash$categories"}
A functor $f: \mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{D}$ is an equivalence iff $f$ is fully faithful and essentially surjective.
:::

:::{.definition title="Full Subcategories"}
Let $S \subset \mathcal{C}_0$ be some subset of objects, and define $\mathcal{C}_S \subset \mathcal{C}$ as a simplicial subset given by 
\[  
\mathcal{C}_S \da \ts{\text{All simplices with vertices in } S}
.\]
:::

:::{.remark}
That this is an $\infty\dash$category follows from checking definitions.

If we first *saturate* $S$ under equivalence of objects, i.e. form the larger subset $\bar S \supseteq S$ consisting of all objects in $\mathcal{C}$ which are equivalent to some object in $S$, this produces a functor
\[  
F: \mathcal{C}_S \injects \mathcal{C}_{\bar S}
,\]
which is fully faithful and essentially surjective[^why_obvious] and thus an equivalence.
So if you're interested in categories up to equivalence, this replacement is always a valid move.

[^why_obvious]: This is purportedly "obvious": being essentially surjective is clear, and fully faithful follows from defining mapping spaces as pullbacks, and writing it out yields an equality of simplicial sets.

## Homotopic (and Contractible Spaces of) Choices

:::{.remark}
Note that the pullback construction from before seems to generalize:

\begin{tikzcd}
	{\Map_{\mathcal{C}}\qty{\ts{a_1, \cdots, a_n}} } && {\Fun(\Delta^{n-1}, \mathcal{C})} \\
	& {} \\
	{\Delta^0} && {\mathcal{C}^n}

This can be thought of as the space of $n\dash$simplices whose vertices are at the $n+1$ given objects.
We can define compositions of morphisms by taking $n=3$, and applying boundary operators yields maps


\begin{tikzcd}
	&& {\Map_{\mathcal C}(a,b,c)} \\
	\\
	{\Map_{\mathcal C}(b,c) \cross \Map_{\mathcal C}(a, b)} &&&& {\Map_{\mathcal C}(a, c)}
	\arrow["{\bd_1}", from=1-3, to=3-5]
	\arrow["{f = (\bd_0, \bd_2)}"', from=1-3, to=3-1]
	\arrow["{\exists h}"', from=3-1, to=3-5, dashed]
\end{tikzcd}

where the existence of $h$ follows from the fact that $f$ is an equivalence and can thus be inverted.
This is induced by maps on Kan complexes

\begin{tikzcd}
	&& {\Delta^2} \\
	\\
	{\Lambda_1^2} &&&& {\Delta^1}
	\arrow[from=3-1, to=1-3]

where we're taking the inner horn and the outer face respectively.
This can be thought of as horn-filling in families.
:::

:::{.remark}
Why is this important?
Given two morphisms, we can pick a composition, and there are multiple ways to do so.
We can then look at the middle face to define the actual composition, up to equivalence of morphisms.
This relies on a choice of homotopy inverse $s$, allowing us to define a map $\circ_s$.
But given an equivalence, there is a unique homotopy inverse up to homotopy, so any two choices of $s$, say $s$ and $s'$ give homotopic maps $\circ_s$ and $\circ_{s'}$.
In good situations, we have even more: the space of such choices will be contractible, which is stronger than there just being a homotopy between any two choices.
So composition is "unique", it's just that there's not one preferred choice.
:::

:::{.remark}
Associativity follows from a similar line of reasoning applied to $\Map_{\mathcal{C}}(a,b,c,d)$ on four objects.
Compare this to Segal categories, where such spaces are part of the data: categories weakly enriched in spaces, and $\infty\dash$categories recover this for free.
There is a way to think of $\infty\dash$categories as "categories enriched in Kan complexes" with a more strict condition of associativity.
:::

:::{.remark}
We recover all of ordinary category theory when the mapping spaces are discrete.
Looking at Kan complexes also yields $\infty\dash$categories where all of the morphisms are invertible, so these are in fact $\infty\dash$groupoids.
For us, "spaces" and Kan complexes are synonymous, and the $\infty\dash$category of spaces will be the fundamental example we run with.

## Preliminaries


### Definition: $n$ connectivity
A space $X$ is said to be *$n\dash$connected* if $\pi_i X = 0$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$.

### Definition: Weak Homotopy Equivalence
A map $f: X \to Y$ is called a *weak homotopy equivalence* if the induced maps $f_i^* : \pi_i(X, x_0) \to \pi_i(Y, f(x_0))$ are isomorphisms for every $i \geq 0$.

This is a strictly weaker notion than homotopy equivalence - for example, let $L$ be the long line. Then $\pi_i(L) = 0$ for all $i$, but $L$ is not contractible, and thus $L \not\sim \pt$. However, the inclusion $\pt \injects L$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, which can not be a homotopy equivalence.

Any weak homotopy equivalence induces isomorphisms on all integral co/homology groups, and thus co/homology groups with any coefficients by the UCT.

### Definition: Cellular Map
If a map $X \mapsvia{f} Y$ satisfies $f(X^{(n)}) \subseteq Y^{(n)}$, then $f$ is said to be a *cellular map*.

### Theorem: Cellular Approximation
Any map $X \mapsvia{f} Y$ between CW complexes is homotopic to a cellular map.

### Theorem: CW Approximation
For every topological space $X$, there exists a CW complex $Y$ and a weak homotopy equivalence $f: X \to Y$. Moreover, if $X$ is $n\dash$dimensional, $Y$ may be chosen to be $n\dash$connected and is obtained from $X$ by attaching cells of dimension greater than $n$.

### Theorem: Whitehead
**Abbreviated statement**: if $X, Y$ are CW complexes, then any map $f: X \to Y$ is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if it is a homotopy equivalence.

(Note: $f$ must induce maps on all homotopy groups simultaneously.)

**Full Statement**: If $(X, x_0) \mapsvia{f} (Y, f(x_0))$ such that the induced maps
$$
f_*: \pi_*(X, x_0) \to \pi_*(Y, y_0) \\
 [g] \mapsto [f \circ g]
$$
are all isomorphisms and $Y$ is connected, then $f$ is a homotopy equivalence.

### Theorem: Uniqueness of E-M Spaces
If $X$ is a space with one nontrivial homology group $G$ in degree $k$, so that $X$ satisfies
$$\pi_i(X) = \cases{G,~i=k\\0,~\text{otherwise}}$$

Then $X \simeq K(G, k)$.

(Note: two spaces with isomorphic homotopy groups may *not* be homotopy-equivalent in general - this is one exception.)

### Theorem: Hurewicz
Given a space $X$, define a family of maps
$$
 h_k: \pi_k X \to H_k X\\
 [f] \mapsto f_*(\mu_k)
$$
where $H_k X = \langle \mu_k \rangle$.

If $X$ is $n-1$ connected where $n\geq 2$, then $h_k$ is an isomorphism for all $k \leq n$.

In particular, $\pi_n X \cong H_n X$ as groups.

### Theorem: Freudenthal Suspension
If $X$ is an $n\dash$ connected CW complex, then there are maps $\pi_i X \to \pi_{i+1} \Sigma X$ which is an isomorphism for $i\leq 2n$ and a surjection for $i=2n+1$.

### Theorem: Spectral sequence of a Fibration

When proving stuff about algebras -- try with polynomial algebras first, essentially the simplest case.
Simplest coalgebra case: divided power algebras (also a Hopf algebra)

# Hochschild Homology

Reference: <a href="file:///home/zack/Dropbox/Library/Charles A. Weibel/An Introduction to Homological Algebra (489)/An Introduction to Homological Algebra - Charles A. Weibel.pdf#page=312">Chapter 9 of Weibel</a>

The Hochschild homology of an $R\dash R\dash$bimodule reflects some ring-theoretic stuff. For instance, $H_1(R,R)$ of a $k\dash$algebra $R$ is the module of differentials $\Omega_R/k$. If $Q\subseteq R$ then there is an algebraic decomposition of this homology that is analogous to the Hodge decomposition in complex manifold theory.

Taking the above example further if $k$ is a ring and $X$ a simplicial set, the cyclic homology (Hochschild homology taking into account a cyclic action on the corresponding simplicial set) of the simplicial module $k[X]$ is the same as the $S_1\dash$equivariant homology of the geometric realization of $X$ with coefficients in $k$.

K-theory is like homology on rings. Moreover, algebraic topology is clearly interested in vector bundles; on a nice space $X$ the category of rank $n$ $\RR\dash$vector bundles on $X$ is equivalent to the category of rank $n$ finitely generated projective modules over the continuous functions $C(X,\RR)$. The group $K_0(C(X))$ is the Grothendieck group of the isomorphism classes of finitely generated projectives.

We look first at vector bundles over a space $X$. A vector bundle assigns a vector
space to every point of $X$. This is done in a continuous fashion. The $k\dash$dimensional
vector bundles over $X$ are equivalent to the homotopy classes of maps from $X$ to
a fixed space $BO_k, [X, BO_k]$, [Ste51]. So, as is the case with many geometric
problems, the classification of isomorphism classes of $k\dash$dimensional vector bundles
is reduced to the computation of homotopy classes of maps. Furthermore, it is clear
that studying $BO_k$ is very useful for this problem. It comes about by a standard
construction which builds a classifying space, $BG$, for any group $G$.

# Defining THH

- Take $A \in \mathcal C$, where $\mathcal C$ is a "nice" monoidal category, and $A$ is an algebra object in it. We'll call the monoidal operation $\tensor$.
- We'll make a simplicial object $THH_\wait(A)$:
  - $THH_n(A) = A^{\tensor n+1}$. If it's to be simplicial, need to specify the face/degeneracy maps:
  - Face maps: collapse by cyclic multiplication
  - Degeneracy maps: use the unit of $A$, can replace any tensor symbol with it. Have a unit map that goes from the unit to $A$, so somehow this gets you "up" one level (?)
- Now take its geometric realization $\abs{THH_\wait(A)}$
  - In general, take $\mathrm{hocolim}_\Delta THH_\wait(A)$

# Unsorted

Computing various homological invariants of associative algebras (such as Tor and Ext of various modules, Hochschild (co)homology, cyclic homology etc.) has been an active research topic in ring theory for many years. More recently (about 15 years ago), ring theorists became interested in associative algebras up to homotopy, or A∞-algebras, as a recipe to produce meaningful "higher structures" on classical objects like Yoneda Ext-algebras.

This offers two different perspectives on associative algebras: homological invariants are "Abelian" (i. e. arise when one works with additive categories, e.g. chain complexes of modules over a ring), while homotopical invariants are "non-Abelian" (i. e. arise from non-additive categories, like the category of all differential graded associative algebras). However, these two perspectives are closely related, and it is often possible to recover homological information from the homotopical one, and the other way round. For experts in homotopical algebra on a larger scale (beyond the associative ring theory), this philosophy is already present in works of Stasheff and Hinich on homotopy algebras.


Look at the HKR theorem again, identifies $HH$ with derivations.

- A fibration $F \to X \to B$ induces a LES in Homotopy
- A fibration $F \to X \to B$ induces a spectral sequence with $E_2^{p,q} = H^p(F; H_q(B))$ and $E_\infty \implies H_*X$

- For every $n$, there is a map $X \to K(\pi_n X, n)$ which induces an isomorphism on $\pi_n$ of both spaces. This can be replaced with a fibration up to homotopy, so call the fiber $X_{(n)}$ and this yields $$X_{(n)} \to X \to K(\pi_n X, n)$$

What we want to represent is $SO(3, \RR)$, where a real representation of a group $G$ is a map $G \to \GL(n, \RR)$ for some $n$.
More generally, we can define a $V\dash$representation as a map $G \to \Aut(V)$, where since $V$ lives in the category of
vector spaces, this amounts to requiring that $G$ maps to a linear map.
Equivalently we can ask for a $V\dash$linear map $G\cross V \to V$ (i.e. a group action on $V$).

So the goal is to construct a representation $f: SO(3, \RR)) \to \GL(n, \RR)$ for some $n$.
Suppose we are working with Euler angles
$$
E \definedas \theset{ (\phi, \theta, \psi) \suchthat \phi,\psi \in [0, 2\pi], \theta \in [0,\pi]} / \sim
$$

where $2\pi \phi \sim \phi, 2\pi\psi \sim \psi, \pi\psi\sim\psi$.
We can then cook up a representation $g: E \to \GL(n, \RR)$ by writing down appropriate rotation matrices in
the parameters $\phi, \theta, \psi$:
$$
R = \left[ \begin{array} { c c c } { 1 } & { 0 } & { 0 } \\ { 0 } & { \cos \alpha } & { - \sin \alpha } \\ { 0 } & { \sin \alpha } & { \cos \alpha } \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array} { c c c } { \cos \beta } & { 0 } & { \sin \beta } \\ { 0 } & { 1 } & { 0 } \\ { - \sin \beta } & { 0 } & { \cos \beta } \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array} { c c c } { \cos \gamma } & { - \sin \gamma } & { 0 } \\ { \sin \gamma } & { \cos \gamma } & { 0 } \\ { 0 } & { 0 } & { 1 } \end{array} \right] = = \left[ \begin{array} { c c c } { 0 } & { 0 } & { 1 } \\ { \sin ( \alpha + \gamma ) } & { \cos ( \alpha + \gamma ) } & { 0 } \\ { - \cos ( \alpha + \gamma ) } & { \sin ( \alpha + \gamma ) } & { 0 } \end{array} \right]
$$

Note that each angle lives in a real interval with the endpoints identified, which is topologically a circle.
So, up to homeomorphism, we have $E \cong S^1 \cross S^1 \cross S^1 = (S^1)^3 = T^3$, a real 3-torus. 
The question then becomes whether or not the representation we are looking for, say $SO(3, \RR) \to \GL(n, \RR)$, factors through the representation $E\ to \GL(n, \RR)$ that we have cooked up. 
This amounts to asking if there is a map $h: \SO^3 \to T^3$ that makes the following diagram commute:

\begin{tikzcd}
T^3 \arrow[rrdd, "g"]                                       &  &                              \\
                                                            &  &                              \\
{SO(3, \mathbb{R})} \arrow[rr, "f"] \arrow[dd, "h", dashed] &  & {\mathrm{Gl}(n, \mathbb{R})}
\end{tikzcd}

In other words, can we factor the complicated representation $f$ that we want through a simpler representation $g$?
In order for this to be a fully faithful representation, this amounts to asking if we can replace $SO(3, \RR)$ by $E$ up to isomorphism in some category.

In particular, we should ask that this diagram preserves all of the structure we care about. 
Since we are viewing everything in sight as a smooth topological group, we should ask that all maps be continuous group homomorphisms.

In particular, we would want $h$ to be a homeomorphism -- however, something has already gone awry, because this is not the case. Perhaps the easiest way to see this is by considering fundamental groups. 
Topologically, we have $\SO(3, \RR) \cong \RP^3$ and in particular $\pi_1(\RP^3) \cong \ZZ/2\ZZ$. 
However, $\pi_1(T^3) \cong \ZZ^3$, and so these spaces are not homeomorphic.

We might instead ask that $h$ be a covering map, so that $T^3$ covers $\SO(3, \RR)$ in some sufficiently nice way instead. 
It turns out that such a surjective map can be constructed, but from the above discussion, we know that injectivity will have to fail, and it is this phenomenon which introduces the singularities that result in gimbal lock. 
When writing out such a map, this singular points will be to coordinates at which the map will be less than full rank, and fail to be a local homeomorphism in neighborhoods of these points.

To explicitly construct such a map, we'll identify $SO(3, \RR)$ with $\RP^3$ and look for a map $h': T^3 \to \RP^3$.
Nix that, we'll actually want to look at all possible covers of $\RP^3$. One such covering space is $S^3$, where
the covering map is given by identifying antipodal points.

> Definition [Hatcher]: For a topological space $X$, a covering space of $X$ is a space $\tilde X$ and a map $p: \tilde X \to X$ such that for each point $x\in X$, there exists an open neighborhood $U_x\subet X$ of $x$ such that $p^{-1}i(U_x) = \coprod \tilde{U}_x$ such that each $\tilde{U}_x$ is homeomorphic to $U_x$, where the homeomorphism is realized by $p$.

One fact we can use here is that if $p$ is a covering map, then the induced map on fundamental groups $p_*: \tilde X \to X$ is an injection. 
Since we are taking $X = \RP^3$ here and we know $\pi_1(\RP^3) = \ZZ/2\ZZ$, we can narrow our search a bit by asking what groups $G$ can fit into an injective group homomorphism $G \to \ZZ/2\ZZ$. 
This narrows our choices for $\tilde X$ considerably, since this forces $\pi_1(\tilde X) = \ZZ/2\ZZ\text{ or }0$. 
This immediately excludes $T^3$ from being a possibility, since $\pi_1(T^3) = \ZZ^3$ and an infinite group can not be injected into a finite group.

We can in fact instead appeal to the classification of covering spaces, which says that there is a Galois correspondence between covering spaces of $X$ and subgroups of $\pi_1(X)$. Since $\ZZ/2\ZZ$ has exactly two subgroups, $0$ and $\ZZ/2\ZZ$, this leaves us with exactly two choices. The identity map $\RP^2 \to \RP^2$ yields the covering space corresponding to $\ZZ/2\ZZ$, and the remaining choice can be realized by taking $S^3 \mapsvia{p} \RP^2$ where $p(\vector{x}) = [x_1, x_2, x_3]$ in homogeneous coordinates. 

Topologically, noting that 
$$
p(-\vector x) = [-x_1, -x_2, -x_3] = [x_1, x_2, x_3]
,$$

which follows from the identity $[x,y, \cdots] = [\lambda x, \lambda y, \cdots]$ for any scalar $\lambda$ in projective spaces, we find that this map is realized by taking points on the sphere and identifying them with their antipodes.

Since $\pi_1(S^3) = 0$, the induced map $p_*(\pi_1(S^3)) \to \pi_1(\RP^3)$ will be the zero map, and thus $p_*(\pi_1(S^3)) = 0$ and we obtain the second possible covering space. 
This can also be seen from the fact that $S^3$ is simply connected, so $\pi_1(S^3) = 0$, and thus $S^3$ is the universal cover of $\RP^3$.

Of particular importance here is the fact that the only possibilities for covers were $S^3$ or $\RP^3$ itself. 
We know that $\RP^3 \not\cong T^3$ by looking at fundamental groups; we can also find that $S^3 \not\cong T^3$ by looking at $\pi_3$. In particular, $\pi_1(S^3) = 0$ while $\pi_1(T^3) = \ZZ^3$. 
So there can not exist a covering map $T^3 \to \RP^3$, which means that any such map we construct must fail the local homeomorphic mapping condition in a neighborhood of at least one point.

So let's attempt to define such a map and see what goes wrong. Since $T^3 = S^1 \cross S^1 \cross S^1$, let a coordinate on the torus be given by $(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3)$ where each $\theta_i \in [0, 2pi)$. Inspired by how nicely the previous map $S^3 \to \RP^3$ worked, let us first define
$$
p: \T^3 \to \RP^3 \\ (\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3) \mapsto [\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3]
.$$
Since we hope to represent all elements of $SO(3,\RR)$ in this way, we want a surjective map.

- "Etale groups schemes are entirely determined by their geometric points."
- The basic idea for deformation theory is to understand when an object $X/S$ for $S$ a scheme lifts to an infinitesimal neighborhood of $S$.
  - Example: When does an elliptic curve $E/\ZZ_p$ lift to an elliptic scheme $\mathcal E / \ZZ_p$?
- "Deformation theory for ‘blah’s is the study of smoothness for the moduli space of ‘blah’s."

# Contact Geometry

> Contact geometry also has applications to low-dimensional topology; for example, it has been used by Kronheimer and Mrowka to prove the property P conjecture, by Michael Hutchings to define an invariant of smooth three-manifolds, and by Lenhard Ng to define invariants of knots. It was also used by Yakov Eliashberg to derive a topological characterization of Stein manifolds of dimension at least six.

# Computation of $H^*(\CP^2)$

View rendered version [here](https://rawgit.com/dzackgarza/Notes/master/Research/Computations/Computation%20of%20HCP2.html)

## Theorem

Suppose $F \to E \to B $ is a fibration satisfying (conditions).

Then there exists a spectral sequence $E_*$ such that

1. $E_2^{p,q} = H^p(B, H^q(F;\ZZ)) = H^p(B;\ZZ) \tensor H^q(F;\ZZ)$
2. $E_\infty^{p,q} \Rightarrow H^{p+q}(E)$

## Computation

Use the above theorem with the fibration $S^1 \into S^5 \into \CP^2$, as well as the following facts:

1. $H^*(S^1) = \ZZ\delta_0 + \ZZ\delta_1$
2. $H^*(S^5) = \ZZ\delta_0 + \ZZ\delta_5$
3. $H^0(\CP^2) = \ZZ$ (i.e. it is simply connected)
4. $d_2: E_2^{p,q} \to E_2^{p-2, q+1}$

By the theorem, we have

$$E_2^{p,q} = H^p(\CP^2) \tensor H^q(S^1)$$

Thus the $E_2$ page of the spectral sequence looks like this:

Using the facts above, we can substitute in some known groups:

Now recalling two useful properties of the tensor product:

1. $A \tensor_\ZZ 0 = 0$, and
2. $A \tensor_\ZZ \ZZ = A$,

we obtain the following simplified version of the $E_2$ page, with several of the potentially non-trivial differentials indicated:

Now we use the fact that the spectral sequence converges to make several deductions:

## Claim:
$$H^1(S^5) = 0 \implies H^2(\CP^2) \cong \ZZ~\text{and}~H^1(\CP^2) = 0$$

(This will be a template argument for most of the rest, so I will spell out more details here and gloss over them later.)

- This means that $E_\infty^{0,1} \oplus E_\infty^{1,0} = 0$.
- Consider the process of obtaining the $E_3$ page:
  - $E_3^{0,1}$ is obtained from the homology of the complex $0 \into \ZZ \mapsvia{\del_1} H^2(\CP^2) \into 0$, i.e. we have $E_3^{0,1} = \frac{\ker \del_1}{\im 0} = \ker \del_1$
    - Note that all differentials after the $E_3$ page extend into the $p<0$ and $q<0$ quadrants, so there is stabiization here and $E_3^{0,1} = E_\infty^{0,1}$
      - But if the homology of this sequence is not zero, then $E_3^{1,0} \neq 0$, so $E_\infty^{0,1} \neq 0$ and $E_\infty^{0,1} \oplus E_\infty^{1,0} \neq 0$, a contradiction.
    - So this is an acyclic complex, and thus an exact sequence.
    - **So $\del_1$ is an isomorphism, and $H^2(\CP^2) \cong \ZZ$**
  - $E_3^{1,0}$ is obtained from the homology of $0 \into H^1(\CP^2) \into 0$
    - By the same argument, this spot stabilizes at $E_3$ and so this complex must have trivial homology.
    - **But this can only happen if $H^1(\CP^2) = 0$**


## Claim:

$$H^2(S^5) = 0 \implies H^1(\CP^2) \cong H^3(\CP^2) ~\text{and}~ H^2(\CP^2) = \ZZ$$

We have $H^2(S^5) = E_\infty^{0,2} \oplus E_\infty^{1,1} \oplus E_\infty^{2,0}$.

Note that $E_2^{0,2} = 0$, so $E_\infty^{0,2} = 0$ there are only two contributing terms to consider.

$E_\infty^{1,1}$: This involves looking at the complex $0 \into H^1(\CP^2) \mapsvia{\del_2} H^3(\CP^2) \into 0$. All differentials extend into zero quadrants starting at $E_3$, so this entry stabilizes at $E_3$. But any homology in this complex would contribute a nonzero contribution to $H^2(S^5)$, so this complex is acyclic/exact and $\del_2$ is an isomorphism.

$E_\infty^{2,0}$: This involves $0 \into \ZZ \mapsvia{f} H^2(\CP^2) \into 0$, where the $E^3$ differentials extend into zero quadrants and thus this entry stabilizes at $E^3$. Any nonzero homology here yields a nonzero contribution to $H^2(S^5)$, so this complex is acyclic/exact and thus $f$ is an isomorphism.

## Claim:

$$H^3(S^5) = 0 \implies H^2(\CP^4) \cong H^4(\CP^2) \cong
H^6(\CP^2),~ H^1(\CP^2) \cong H^3(\CP^2) \cong H^5(\CP^2)$$

Note: this is the first spot where the differentials may not extend into zero quadrants, but since the total homology is zero, this is not a real issue yet.

We have $H^3(S^5) = \displaystyle\bigoplus_{p+q = n}E_\infty^{p,q} = E_\infty^{0,3} \oplus E_\infty^{1,2} \oplus E_\infty^{2,1} \oplus E_\infty^{3,0}$. Every summand must be zero, so we examine them individually.

$E_\infty^{0,3}$: We have $E_2^{0,3} = 0$ and is involved in a complex of the form $0 \into E_2^{0,3} \into E_2^{2,2} \into E_2^{4,1} \into E_2^{6,0} \into 0$, which we can identify as $0 \into 0 \into 0 \into H^4(\CP^2) \into H^6(\CP^2) \into 0$, which must be exact, so we have $H^4(\CP^2) \cong H^6(\CP^2)$.

$E_\infty^{1,2}$: We have the complex $0 \into E_2^{1,2} \into E_2^{3,1} \into E_2^{5, 0} \into 0$ which equals $0 \into 0 \into H^3(\CP^2) \mapsvia{f} H^5(\CP^2) \into 0$, which must be exact and so $f$ is an isomorphism yielding $H^3(\CP^2) \cong H^5(\CP^2)$.

$E_\infty^{2,1}$: We have the complex $0 \into E_2^{0, 2} \into E_2^{2, 1} \into E_2^{4, 0} \into 0$ which equals $0 \into 0 \into H^2(\CP^2) \into H^4(\CP^2) \into 0$, so $H^2(\CP^2) \cong H^4(\CP^2)$.

(Here we are using the fact that $E_2^{0,2} = H^2(S^1) = 0$ instead of the automatic zeros from the differentials extending into zero quadrants.)

$E_\infty^{3,0}$: We have $0 \into E_2^{1,1} \into E_2^{3,0} \into 0$ which equals $0 \into H^1(\CP^2) \into H^3(\CP^2) \into 0$ which must be exact and so $H^1(\CP^2) \cong H^3(\CP^2)$

Note that $H^4(S^5) = 0$ doesn't give any new information at this point.

## Claim
$$H^5(S^5) = \ZZ \implies H^6(\CP^2) = 0$$

We have $H^5(S^5) = \displaystyle\bigoplus_{p+q=n}E_2^{p,q}$, and so there must now be a nonzero term in this sum.

Since $q > 1$ stabilizes to zero on $E_2$, the nonzero term must come from $E_2^{5,0}$ or $E_2^{4,1}$.

$E_2^{5,0}$: The complex is $0 \into H^3(\CP^2) \into H^5(\CP^2) \into 0$

$E_2^{4,1}$: The complex is $0 \into H^4(\CP^2) \into H^6(\CP^2) \into 0$

In order for an $E_3$ term to be nonzero, one of these complexes must have nonzero homology. But by the previous claim, $0 \into H^3(\CP^2) \into H^5(\CP^2) \into 0$ does have zero homology, so we consider the second complex instead.

We know from our current results that  $0 \into H^4(\CP^2) \into H^6(\CP^2) \into 0$ is equal to $0 \into \ZZ \mapsvia{f} H^6(\CP^2) \into 0$, and we know that $\frac{\ker f}{\im 0} = \ker f \cong H^5(S^5) = \ZZ$, since this is the only possible nonzero term in the above sum.

(Not sure how to use $\ker f = 0$ to show $H^6(\CP^2) = 0$, or how to inductively compute $H^*(\CP^n)$.)

Basically, all of these computations are based on the fact that $SO^n$ acts transitively on $S^{n-1}$ with stabilizer $SO^{n-1}$, producing fibrations of the form $SO^{n-1} \to SO^n \to S^{n-1}$. The overall question: can this be used to inductively determine $H^*(SO^n)$ for all $n$?

# 1) Cohomology of SO3

A priori, we can use the fact that $SO^3$ is diffeomorphic to $\RP^3$ to obtain

$$H^*(SO^3) = H^*(\RP^3) = [\ZZ, 0, \ZZ_2, \ZZ, 0, 0, \cdots]$$

But supposing we didn't know the cohomology of the total space, the Serre spectral sequence can be applied by using the fibration

$$ S^1 \to SO^3 \to S^2$$


and then the usual theorems give the formula (in cohomology)

$$ E_2^{p,q} = H^p(S^2) \tensor H^q(S^1).$$

This yields the following $E_2$  and $E_3$ pages respectively (indexing columns with $p$ and rows with $q$):

```latex{cmd=true hide=true run_on_save=true}

\end{tikzcd}
$$
}

\end{document}
```

where the dots are zeros, circled entries have stabilized, and the trivial differentials are suppressed.

This allows us to conclude:

- $H^0(SO^3) = \ZZ$
- $H^3(SO^3) = \ZZ$

But so far, nothing about $H^1$ or $H^2$.

We know that $d_2^{0,1} \in \hom(\ZZ, \ZZ)$, so there are a few cases:

1. $d_2^{0,1}(1) = 0$, so it's the zero map, and we obtain this $E^2$ page:


    |   |    |
    ---   |---| ---| ---
    $\ZZ$ | 0 | 0  | 0
    $\ZZ$ | 0 | 0  | 0

2. $d_2^{0,1} = \pm 1$, so it's an isomorphism, yielding

    |   |    |
    ---   |---| ---| ---
    0 | 0 | $\ZZ$  | 0
    $\ZZ$ | 0 | 0  | 0


3. $d_2^{0,1}(1) = \pm n$ for some $n\neq 0,1$, in which case there's torsion:

    |   |    |
    ---   |---| ---| ---
    0 | 0 | $\ZZ$  | 0
    $\ZZ$ | 0 | $\ZZ_n$  | 0

In any case, at most one of the diagonals survive.
So this leads to the following questions:


## Question 1.1
Can this be pushed any farther without bringing in external information?

For example, a posteriori we know that $SO^3 \cong \RP^3$ which forces case (3) to hold, where $n=2$ and $d_2^{0,1}(1) = 2$. (Is there anything interesting about knowing this differential explicitly?)

Is there any more algebraic information here, or is this the point where one would turn to geometric information to continue?

## Question 1.2
Supposing the cohomology is known, how do you write the ring/algebra structure?

By pushing generators around with cup products, it looks like a polynomial ring, but I'm not quite sure how to handle the fact that there are both $\ZZ$ and $\ZZ_2$ coefficients around.

One easy reduction is just to take $\ZZ_2$ coefficients, then I think $H^*(\RP^3; \ZZ_2) \cong \ZZ_2[x]/(x^4)$ as algebras.

For $\alpha \in H^*(\RP^3; \ZZ)$ though, it seems like it can be written as $\ZZ \oplus \ZZ_2 e^2 \oplus \ZZ e^3$ where $e^i$ is a generator in degree $i$. Is there a nice/clean way to express this as some polynomial ring $\ZZ[\text{stuff}_1]/(\text{stuff}_2)$, or maybe as some algebra $\Lambda(\text{stuff})$?

# 2) Cohomology of SO4

Supposing we know $H^*(SO^3) = [\ZZ, 0, \ZZ_2, \ZZ]$, we can use the fibration

$$ SO^3 \to SO^4 \to S^3$$

yielding

$$E_2^{p,q} = H^p(S^3) \tensor H^q(SO^3).$$

This is a little like the previous case, except the $E_2$ page is boring because the columns are further separated. Almost all entries stabilize early (partially due to the gap in row 1!) and the only potentially interesting thing happens on $E_3$:

```latex {cmd=true, hide=true, run_on_save=true}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{cd}
\usepackage{dsfont}
\usepackage{amsmath, amsthm, amssymb}
\usepackage{adjustbox}
\newcommand\encircle[1]{%
  \tikz[baseline=(X.base)]
    \node (X) [draw, shape=circle, inner sep=0] {\strut $#1$};}
\begin{document}
\adjustbox{scale=1.5,center}{%
$E_3$:
\begin{tikzcd}
q ~/~ SO^3 & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
3 & \encircle{\mathbb{Z}} & \cdot & \cdot & \encircle{\mathbb{Z}} & \cdot \\
2 & \mathbb{Z}_2 \arrow[rrrdd, "{d_3^{0,2}}" description] & \cdot & \cdot & \encircle{\mathbb{Z}_2} & \cdot \\
1 & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
0 & \encircle{\mathbb{Z}} & \cdot & \cdot & \mathbb{Z} & \cdot \\
 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & p ~/~ S^3
\end{tikzcd}
}
\end{document}
```

(I think this uses the fact that $\dim SO^n = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ somewhere.)

But luckily enough $\hom(\ZZ_m, \ZZ)$ only contains the zero map, so everything on $E_3$ lives forever and it looks like we get
$$
H^*(SO^4) = [\ZZ, 0, \ZZ_2, \ZZ^2, 0, \ZZ_2, \ZZ]
$$

## Question 2.1
Similar to one of the earlier questions: is there a nice way to write the ring/algebra structure?

## Question 2.2
Is there anything interesting that falls out of the cup product structure here? I looked a little bit at trying to mimic the computations of the ring structure of $\CP^n$, but wasn't sure how to proceed. I started looking at $(0,2) \smile (3,0) \to (3,2): \ZZ_2 \cross \ZZ \into \ZZ_2$, but it's a little more complicated than it was for $CP^n$, so I wasn't really sure where to go with it.

# Cohomology of SO5

This one gets a bit more complicated! Supposing you know $SO^4$ from above, you can use the fibration

$SO^4 \to SO^5 \to S^4$

yielding

$E_2^{p,q} = H^p(S^4) \tensor H^q(SO^4)$

which only gets interesting at $E_4$:

```latex {cmd=true, hide=true, run_on_save=true}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{cd}
\usepackage{dsfont}
\usepackage{amsmath, amsthm, amssymb}
\usepackage{adjustbox}
\newcommand\encircle[1]{%
  \tikz[baseline=(X.base)]
    \node (X) [draw, shape=circle, inner sep=0] {\strut $#1$};}
\begin{document}
\adjustbox{scale=1.5,center}{%
$E_4$:
\begin{tikzcd}
q ~/~ SO^4 & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
6 & \mathbb{Z} \arrow[rrrrddd, "{d_4^{0,6}}" description] & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \encircle{\mathbb{Z}} & \cdot \\
5 & \mathbb{Z}_2 \arrow[rrrrddd, "{d_4^{0,5}}" description] & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \encircle{\mathbb{Z}_2} & \cdot \\
4 & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
3 & \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \arrow[rrrrddd, "{d_4^{0,3}}" description] & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} & \cdot \\
2 & \encircle{\mathbb{Z}_2} & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \mathbb{Z}_2 & \cdot \\
1 & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
0 & \encircle{\mathbb{Z}} & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \mathbb{Z} & \cdot \\
 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & p ~/~ S^4
\end{tikzcd}
}
\end{document}
```

Taking a look at $E_5$, everything stabilizes:

```latex {cmd=true, hide=true, run_on_save=true}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{cd}
\usepackage{dsfont}
\usepackage{amsmath, amsthm, amssymb}
\usepackage{adjustbox}
\newcommand\encircle[1]{%
  \tikz[baseline=(X.base)]
    \node (X) [draw, shape=circle, inner sep=0] {\strut $#1$};}
\begin{document}
\adjustbox{scale=1.2,center}{%
$E_5$:
\begin{tikzcd}
q ~/~ SO^4 & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
6 & \encircle{\ker d_4^{0,6}} & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \encircle{\mathbb{Z}} & \cdot \\
5 & \encircle{\ker d_4^{0,5}} & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \encircle{\mathbb{Z}_2} & \cdot \\
4 & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
3 & \encircle{\ker d_4^{0,3}} & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \encircle{\text{cok}~d_4^{0,6}} & \cdot \\
2 & \encircle{\mathbb{Z}_2} & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \encircle{\text{cok}~d_4^{0,5}} & \cdot \\
1 & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
0 & \encircle{\mathbb{Z}} & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \encircle{\text{cok}~d_4^{0,3}} & \cdot \\
 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & p ~/~ S^4
\end{tikzcd}
}
\end{document}
```

so everything here lives forever, and it just remains to find the kernels/cokernels of these three differentials.

Here's where I got stuck - there are some cases to consider, but I wasn't able to reach any conclusions from them. Going top to bottom, here's what I think the differentials could possibly be, by looking at how they act on generators:

$d_3^{0,3}: \ZZ\oplus \ZZ \to \ZZ$

(Note: can't be injective, so $\ker d_3^{0,3} \neq 0$)

  - The zero map $(1, 0) \mapsto 0$ and $(0,1) \mapsto 0$
  - $(1, 0) \mapsto n, n \neq 0$ and $(0,1) \mapsto 0$
  - $(0, 1) \mapsto n, n \neq 0$ and $(1,0) \mapsto 0$

$d_4^{0,5}: \ZZ_2 \to \ZZ_2$

  - The zero map $1 \mapsto 0$
  - An isomorphism $1 \mapsto 1$

$d_4^{0,5}: \ZZ \to \ZZ \oplus \ZZ$

(Note: can't be surjective, so $\text{cok}~ d_3^{0,5} \neq 0$)

  - The zero map $1 \mapsto (0, 0)$
  - $1 \mapsto (n, 0), n\neq 0$
  - $1 \mapsto (0, n), n\neq 0$


## Question 3.1
Do you think it's possible to proceed from here using purely algebraic information? Is it tractable to try to dig into the spectral sequence and figure out some way to identify and compute these differentials, given that they're 4 pages into the sequence?

## Question 3.2
What actually is $H^*(SO^5)$, even just as a group? Is it actually possible to obtain it with this spectral sequence?

Hatcher seems to do some computation involving Bockstein homomorphisms on page 309 and comes up with:

$$ H^* (SO^5) \cong F[x,y,z] / (2x, x^4, y^4, z^2, xz, x^3 - y^2)$$

where $F$ is a "free graded commutative associative algebra over $\ZZ$". Is this the same thing as a DGA? And how exactly does one extract the list of cohomology groups from this representation?

- The chromatic view-point, which studies stable homotopy theory via its relationships to the moduli of formal groups, and related topics such as topological modular forms, use a sizable amount of (fairly abstract) algebraic geometry. And Lurie's work on derived algebraic geometry was motivated in part by establishing foundations adequate to the task of defining equivariant forms of TMF.

[Behrens Hopkins Hill](https://www3.nd.edu/~mbehren1/papers/exotic2.pdf)
A homotopy n-sphere is a smooth n-manifold which is homotopy equivalent to
$S^n$. Kervaire and Milnor defined Θn to be the group of homotopy spheres up
to h-cobordism (where the group operation is given by connect sum). By the
h-cobordism theorem [Sma62] (n > 4) and Perelman’s proof of the Poincare conjecture [Per02], [Per03a], [Per03b] (n = 3), for n 6= 4, Θn = 0 if and only if $S^n$ has
a unique differentiable structure (i.e. there are no exotic spheres of dimension n).

We wish to consider the following question: For which n is Θn = 0?

The general belief is that there should be finitely many such n, and these n should
be concentrated in relatively low dimensions.

The chromatic tower. Fix a prime p. The chromatic tower of a spectrum X is
the tower of Bousfield localizations
$$
X \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow X _ { E ( n ) } \rightarrow X _ { E ( n - 1 ) } \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow X _ { E ( 0 ) }
$$
where E(n) is the nth Johnson-Wilson spectrum (E(0) = HQ, by convention) with
$$
E ( n ) _ { * } = \mathbb { Z } _ { ( p ) } \left[ v _ { 1 } , \dots , v _ { n - 1 } , v _ { n } ^ { \pm } \right]
$$
The fibers of the chromatic tower
$$
M _ { n } X \rightarrow X _ { E ( n ) } \rightarrow X _ { E ( n - 1 ) }
$$
are called the monochromatic layers. The spectral sequence associated to the chromatic tower is the chromatic spectral sequence
$$
E _ { 1 } ^ { n , * } = \pi _ { * } M _ { n } X \Rightarrow \pi _ { * } X _ { ( p ) }
$$

Let Mell denote the Deligne-Mumford stack of elliptic curves (over Spec(Z)). For
a commutative ring R, the groupoid of R-points of Mell is the groupoid of elliptic
curves over R. This stack carries a line bundle ω where for an elliptic curve C, the
fiber of ω over C is given by
$$ωC = T^∗_e C,$$
the tangent space of C at its basepoint e.
The stack $M_{ell}$ admits a compactification $\overline{M}_{ell}$ whose R points are generalized
elliptic curves. The space of integral modular
forms of weight k is defined to be the sections
$$
H ^ { 0 } \left( \overline { \mathcal { M } } _ { e l l } , \omega ^ { \otimes k } \right)
$$
Motivated by the definition of integral modular forms and this descent spectral
sequence in the case of U = Mell , the spectrum Tmf is defined to be the global
sections
$$
\mathrm { Tmf } : = \mathcal { O } ^ { t o p } \left( \overline { \mathcal { M } } _ { e l l } \right)
$$

A characteristic class is a way of associating to each principal bundle on a topological space $X$ a cohomology class of $X$. The cohomology class measures the extent to which the bundle is "twisted" — particularly, whether it possesses sections or not. In other words, characteristic classes are global invariants which measure the deviation of a local product structure from a global product structure. They are one of the unifying geometric concepts in algebraic topology, differential geometry and algebraic geometry.

Let $G$ be a topological group, and for a topological space $X$, write $bG(X)$ for the set of isomorphism classes of principal G-bundles. This $bG$ is a contravariant functor from Top (the category of topological spaces and continuous functions) to Set (the category of sets and functions), sending a map $f$ to the pullback operation $f*$.

A characteristic class $c$ of principal $G$-bundles is then a natural transformation from $bG$ to a cohomology functor $H*$, regarded also as a functor to Set.

In other words, a characteristic class associates to any principal $G$-bundle $P → X$ in $bG(X)$ an element $c(P)$ in $H^* (X)$ such that, if $f : Y → X$ is a continuous map, then $c(f^* P) = f^* c(P)$. On the left is the class of the pullback of $P$ to $Y$; on the right is the image of the class of $P$ under the induced map in cohomology.

When the theory was put on an organized basis around 1950 (with the definitions reduced to homotopy theory) it became clear that the most fundamental characteristic classes known at that time (the Stiefel–Whitney class, the Chern class, and the Pontryagin classes) were reflections of the classical linear groups and their maximal torus structure.

The prime mechanism then appeared to be this: Given a space $X$ carrying a vector bundle, that implied in the homotopy category a mapping from $X$ to a classifying space $BG$, for the relevant linear group $G$. For the homotopy theory the relevant information is carried by compact subgroups such as the orthogonal groups and unitary groups of $G$. Once the cohomology ${\displaystyle H^* (BG)}$ was calculated, once and for all, the contravariance property of cohomology meant that characteristic classes for the bundle would be defined in ${\displaystyle H^* (X)}$ in the same dimensions.

Characteristic numbers solve the oriented and unoriented bordism questions: two manifolds are (respectively oriented or unoriented) cobordant if and only if their characteristic numbers are equal.

# Big Ideas
- Duality
- Isomorphisms
- Universal Properties
  - Build new objects out of old ones, or "factor" objects into smaller ones
  - Define things "up to a unique isomorphism"
  - Yoneda's Lemma: To study an object, just look at the maps into and/or out of it!
- Functors
- Limits / Colimits
  - Limits: Build new objects by "imposing equations" on existing ones.
    - Ex: Construction of the p-adic integers as the limit of the sequence of quotient homomorphisms: $\cdots \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/p^n \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/p^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/p$
  - Colimits: Build new objects by "gluing together" existing ones:
  - Examples:
    - Products
    - Quotients
    - Kernels
    - Completions
    - Free products
- Adjunction
  - Duality between functors
  - "Partial equivalence" of categories
- Kan Extensions


## Duality

- Reverse arrows and redefine composition in $C$ to obtain $C^{op}$
- Then every "thing" in $C$ has a corresponding "thing" in $C^{op}$, which we call a co-"thing".
  - Products and Coproducts
  - Kernels and Cokernels
  - Limits and Colimits
- Can often obtain two conclusions for the price of one!
- Duality is an involution
  - i.e., a co-co-$X$ is just an $X$
- Canonical Example: Vector spaces $V$ and their duals $V^*$ over a field $k$
  - $V^* = \{\phi: V \rightarrow k\}$ where $\phi$ is linear
  - $V \not\cong V*$, but $V \cong V^{**}$
- A very powerful example: Poincare Duality
  - The $k$th homology group of an $n$-dimensional manifold  is isomorphic $(n-k)$th cohomology group
  - $H^k(M) \cong H_{n-k}(M)$.

## Universal Properties

The algebraic K-groups of a scheme X are defined by producing a spectrum K(X) and setting
$K^n(X) \definedas π_{-n}K(X)$.

> Be warned that K-theorists and geometers write $K_n(X)$ for our $K^{−n}(X)$ -- we will stick to homotopy-theoretic notation, however.

K can be defined so that it actually gives a contravariant functor (Schemes) → (Spectra), and so the groups $K^n(X)$ do indeed start to look like a cohomology theory. For X a topological space, the analogue of K(X) turns out to be the mapping
spectrum $bu^X$, where bu is the spectrum representing complex connective K-theory (so that $bu$ is the connective cover of the spectrum $BU$). 

Thus, the functor K can be thought of as a substitute for the spectrum bu -- it is sort of a device for storing all the same information that bu provides, but without an honest ‘space’ to house it in.

Most of the important results about algebraic K-theory arise from the study of the spectrum K(X), rather than that of the disembodied abelian groups $K^n(X)$. For example, if the scheme X is covered by two open sets U and V , one wants a Mayer-Vietoris sequence
$$
\cdots \rightarrow K ^ { n } ( X ) \rightarrow K ^ { n } ( U ) \oplus K ^ { n } ( V ) \rightarrow K ^ { n } ( U \cap V ) \rightarrow K ^ { n + 1 } ( X ) \rightarrow \cdots
$$

This follows formally once one proves the stronger result that
$$
\begin{CD}
\mathcal{K}(C) @>>> \mathcal{K}(U) \\
@VVV @VVV \\
\mathcal{K}(V) @>>> \mathcal{K}(U\intersect V)
\end{CD}
$$
is a homotopy pullback diagram.

Our first guess is motivated by the hypothesis that a contravariant functor $E$ : (Schemes) → (Spectra), in analogy to the functor $K$, should look like a cohomology theory. A weak equivalence of schemes $X \to Y$ would be expected to have the property
that $E(Y ) → E(X)$ is a weak equivalence of spectra for every such $E$. 

Believing that this gives the ‘correct’ definition of weak equivalence reduces to believing that the whole homotopy theory of schemes is captured in the two basic facts that $\mathrm{hocolim}~U_\wait \longrightarrow X$ and $X \cross I \to X$ are weak equivalences.  The surprising answer is yes. If we use this definition in the case of reasonable topological spaces (like CW-complexes) we do recover the usual notion of weak equivalence. It says that the homotopy-theory of topological spaces can indeed be ‘generated’ by these two fundamental properties.

The problem is that Zariski open covers don’t tell the whole story about the homotopy-type of schemes. The first indications of this date back to Grothendieck’s work on etale cohomology: looking at only Zariski covers makes the spectrum of a field look contractible, whereas in real life they behave more like $K(π, 1)$ (for example, they have nontrivial covering spaces).

We begin with the observation that algebraic topologists, despite what we are usually led to
believe, are really not very interested in the category of topological spaces. Of course there are
certain subcategories, like the category of manifolds, in which they are highly interested—but the
notion of ‘topological space’ is much too broad, admitting a host of pathological objects for which
the machinery of algebraic topology is simply not intended.
On the other hand, categories such as topological manifolds end up being much too small for
many purposes. The industrious homotopy-theorist finds himself wanting to glue manifolds together,
quotient out by subspaces, divide out by group actions—in short, take various colimits—all of which
have the disadvantage of perhaps producing something which is no longer a manifold. Gluing
manifolds together might lead one to study some category of cell complexes, but of course these
categories end up not being closed under colimits either. Thus, what the algebraic topologist desires
is a setting in which he can study the category of manifolds (or finite complexes, if he is daring),
have all small colimits at his disposal, and yet does not have to worry about the pathology that goes
along with objects as diverse as topological spaces.

Paper: [A Guide for Computing Stable Homotopy Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07530)

- Main idea: certain types of "topological field theories" are classified by certain stable homotopy classes of maps between 2 specific spectra
- Main tool: Adams spectral sequence, invented to resolve Hopf invariant one. Relates cohomology of spaces/spectra to stable homotopy
- Mod-2 cohomology of any space is a module over the Steenrod algebra
- Two important classes of isomorphisms: chain homotopy equivalences vs quasi-isomorphisms.
  - Derived category inverts quasi-isomorphisms (not an equivalence relation!)
  - Homotopy category inverts chain homotopy equivalences. In theory, easier to do.
  - For bounded below projective chain complexes, quasi-iso implies chain homotopy equivalence, so can take derived category to be projective chain complexes with chain homotopy equivalences as morphisms
- Analogy:
  - Chain homotopy equivalences for modules $\iff$ homotopy equivalences
  - Quasi-isomorphisms $\iff$ weak homotopy equivalences
  - Derived category $\iff$ homotopy category of spectra
  - Projective chain complexes $\iff$ CW spectra
- Standard examples of spectra:
  - Suspension spectrum: for any space $X$, $$\Sigma^\infty X \definedas \qty{ X_0 \definedas X \to X_1 \definedas \Sigma X \to X_2 \definedas \Sigma^2 X \to \cdots},$$ yields a functor $\Sigma^\infty:\text{Top} \to \text{PreSpectra}$ with adjoint $\Omega^\infty$ where $X \mapsto X_0$.
  - $HG \definedas K(G, 0) \mapsvia{\omega_0^*} K(G, 1) \to \cdots$ where we take the adjoint of the homotopy equivalences $\omega_n: K(G, n) \to \OmegaK(G, n+1)$.
  - $K\dash$theory, where $K = \qty{\ZZ \cross BU \to U \to \ZZ \cross BU \to U \to \cdots}$ using the equivalences given by 2-fold Bott periodicity.
  - Real $K\dash$theory $KO = \qty{\ZZ\cross BO \to \cdots}$ using 8-fold Bott periodicity.
  - Any infinite loop space $X= X_0$, i.e. where $X \homotopic \Omega^k X_k$, then take $X_0 \to X_1 \to \cdots$.
  - Function spectrum $F(X, Y) = ?$.
- Coproduct in $\text{Top}_*$ is wedge
- $\text{Top}_*$ is a closed symmetric monoidal category, where the symmetric monoidal product is the smash product $A \smash B$ for which there is a homeomorphism $\hom_\top(A\smash B, C) \cong \hom_\top(A, \hom_\top(B, C))$.
- Alternate definition of hoTop/DTop as localizing equivalence: initial category receiving a functor which sends blah equivalences to isomorphisms 
- The "usual" category of spectra ios the homotopy category of spectra. Triangulated with shift functor $\Sigma(\wait)$ with inverse $\Omega(\wait)$.
- The sphere spectrum $S^0$ is the unit for the symmetric monoidal structure, i.e. $S^0 \smash X \homotopic X, F(S^0, X) \homotopic X$.
- Pushout and pullback diagrams coincide, exact triangles $X\to Y \to Z \to \Sigma X$ are equivalently fiber and cofiber sequences.
  - $X\to Y$ is null-homotopic iff $Z \homotopic Y \vee \Sigma X$.
- Spectra as generalized homology theories: take coproducts to direct sums and exact triangles to exact sequences
  - For $E$ a spectrum, the homology theory is $E^n(X) = \pi_n(E\smash X)$.
  - For $E = HG$, $HG^\wait (A) = \tilde H^\wait (X; G) \cong HG^\wait(\Sigma^\infty X)$.
- Homotopy groups are well-defined for any spectrum, can be nonzero in negative degrees
- Connective spectra: related to stages of Whitehead tower
- Ring spectra: cohomology theories have a multiplicative structure, gives rise to maps $H\ZZ \smash H\ZZ \to H\ZZ$. For any spectrum $R$ with
  - A multiplication map $R\smash R \to R$
  - A unit map $S^0 \to R$
  - Require that this diagram commutes:
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
  S^0 \smash R \ar[r]\ar[dr, "\homotopic"] & R\smash R\ar[d] & \ar[l] R\smash S\ar[dl, "\homotopic"] \\
  & R &
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  - Commutativity: require that the swap map commutes with multiplication

- Thom spectra: let $\nu: E\to B$ be a real vector bundle over a space, take 1-point compactification of fibers to get the sphere bundle $\text{Sph}(E) \to B$, take the section $s(b) = \infty$ in each fiber, and define the Thom space as $B^\nu = \text{Sph}(E)/s(B)$.
  - Take the suspension spectrum to get the Thom spectrum.
- Virtual bundle: a formal difference of two bundles over a common base $B$
- Model for $BO_n = \colim_{\to k} \Gr(n, \RR^k)$
  - Can take the universal bundle $$E_n = \theset{(V, \vector x) \in G_n \cross \RR^\infty \suchthat \vector x \in V \in G_n  } \to BO_n$$
  - $MO_n$ is the associated Thom space
- Cohomology operation of degree $k$: a natural transformation $H^*(\wait; \ZZ/2\ZZ) \to H^{*+k}(\wait; \ZZ/2\ZZ)$. Stable if if commutes with the suspension isomorphism $H^*(\wait) \cong H^{*+1}(\Sigma(\wait))$.
  - Example: Bockstein morphism, take $0\to A \to B \to C \to 0$ in abelian groups to get a LES, the connecting morphism $H^*(\wait; \ZZ/2\ZZ) \to H^{*+1}(\wait, \ZZ/2\ZZ)$ is $\text{Sq}^1$, a stable operation of degree 1.
- Can form $\RP^2$ as a pushout:
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
  S^1 \arrow[dd] \arrow[rr] &  & D^2 \arrow[dd, dashed] \\
                            &  &                        \\
  S^1 \arrow[rr, dashed]    &  & \RP^2                 
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  and $\CP^2$ as 
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
  S^3 \arrow[dd, "\eta"] \arrow[rr] &  & D^4 \arrow[dd, dashed] \\
                            &  &                        \\
  S^2 \arrow[rr, dashed]    &  & \CP^2                 
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  where $\eta$ is the Hopf fibration.

- Steenrod algebra $\mca$: graded, non-commutative (cocommutative Hopf) $\FF_2\dash$algebra generated in degree $k$ by stable cohomology operations of degree $k$, multiplication given by composition of operations
  - Use Yoneda to show $\mca \cong H\ZZ/2\ZZ^*(H\ZZ/2\ZZ)$.
  - Axiomatically describe squares as $\text{Sq}^k: H^*(\wait; \ZZ/2\ZZ) \to H^{*+k}(\wait; \ZZ/2\ZZ)$.

- Adams Spectral Sequence: in good cases, $$E_2^{s, t} = \ext_{\mca}^{s, t}(H^*(X), \ZZ/2\ZZ) \implies \qty{\pi_{t-s}X}^{\smash}_2$$
- Hurewicz morphism: send a map $f: S^k \to X$ to its induced map on cohomology.
- Generalized EM spectrum: $Z \homotopic HV \homotopic \bigvee_{i\in I} \Sigma^i H\ZZ/2\ZZ$ where $V$ is a graded $\ZZ/2\ZZ\dash$vector space which is finite in every degree.
- Idea: for $X$ a suspension spectrum of a CW complex with finitely many cells in each dimension, resolve it (Adams resolution) by a sequence of spectra $X_n$ admitting maps to generalized EM spectra.
  - For such spectra, the Adams SS computes the 2-completion of the homotopy groups of $X$

# Example: Proving the 5 lemma

Recall the definition: if $X\mapsvia{f} Y$ then $\coker f = \frac{Y}{\im f}$

Expand the usual diagram into a double complex by filling in zeros:
$$
\begin{CD}
0 @<<< 0 @<<< 0 @<<< 0 @<<< 0 @<<< 0 @<<< 0 \\

$$
Here we assume that $k, -j,  -g, f$ are all isomorphisms. Since this is the $E_0$ page, we first take homology starting with the vertical arrows as differentials, this yields the $E_1$ page


$$

Making suitable identifications, this page equals


$$
\begin{CD}

$$

The differentials on this page are now all horizontal arrows - but these are all zero maps, so the spectral sequence has collapsed at this page. We now know this page is the complex that the spectral sequence converges to, even if we don't know what $\ker k$ and $\coker h$ are.

We also know that taking the "dual" spectral sequence converges to the same thing. We start with the same $E_1$ page, but now start with the horizontal arrows as differentials. By exactness of the rows, we have the $E_1$ page
$$
\begin{CD}
0 @<<< 0 @<<< 0 @<<< 0 @<<< 0 @<<< 0 @<<< 0 \\
@. @. @. @. @. @. @. \\

\end{CD}
$$
and since the differentials are necessarily at this page, the spectral sequence has collapsed. But this must be equal to what it converged to in the dual setting, so we obtain $\ker h = 0$ and $\coker h = 0$. But $\ker h = 0$ iff $h$ is injective, and $\coker h = 0$ iff $h$ is surjective, so $h$ is an isomorphism.

>Take a look at Machlachlan and Reid's book "The Arithmetic of Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds".

> Since finite volume hyperbolic structures are unique whenever an n-manifold (n≥3) has them, any invariants of the hyperbolic structure are invariants of the manifold. Hyperbolic manifolds are K(π,1)-spaces, so they're not just diffeo/homeomorphism invariants, but invariants of the homotopy-type.

# Vector Bundles

**Definition:** A _rank $n$ vector bundle_ is a fiber bundle in which the fibers $F$ have the structure of a vector space $k^n$ for some field $k$; the structure group of such a bundle is a subset of $\GL(n, k)$.

Note that a vector bundle always has one global section: namely, since every fiber is a vector space, you can canonically choose the 0 element to obtain a global zero section.

**Proposition**: A rank $n$ vector bundle is trivial iff it admits $k$ linearly independent global sections.

**Example:** The tangent bundle of a manifold is an $\RR$-vector bundle. Let $M^n$ be an $n\dash$ dimensional manifold. For any point $x\in M$, the tangent space $T_xM$ exists, and so we can define
$$
TM = \coprod_{x\in M} T_xM = \theset{(x, t) \mid x\in M, t \in T_xM}
$$
Then $TM$ is a manifold of dimension $2n$ and there is a corresponding fiber bundle
$$
\RR^n \to TM \mapsvia{\pi} M
$$
given by a natural projection $\pi:(x, t) \mapsto x$

**Example** A circle bundle is a fiber bundle in which the fiber is isomorphic to $S^1$ as a topological group. Consider circle bundles over a circle, which are of the form
$$
S^1 \to E \mapsvia{\pi} S^1
$$
There is a trivial bundle, when $E = S^1 \cross S^1 = T^2$, the torus:
![torus bundle](figures/torus-bundle.png)

There is also a nontrivial bundle, $E = K$, the Klein bottle:
![Klein bottle](figures/klein-bottle.png)

As in the earlier example involving the Mobius strip, since $K$ is nonorientable, $T^2 \not\cong K$ and there are thus at least two distinct bundles of this type.

---

_Remark_: A section of the tangent bundle $TM$ is equivalent to a _vector field_ on $M$.

**Definition**: If the tangent bundle of a manifold is trivial, the manifold is said to be _parallelizable._

**Proposition:** The circle $S^1$ is parallelizable.

_Proof_ Let $M = S^1$, then there is a rank 1 vector bundle\
$$\RR \to TM \to M$$
and since $TM = S^1 \cross \RR$ (why?), we find that $S^1$ is parallelizable.

**Proposition:** The sphere $S^2$ is not parallelizable.

_Proof_: Let $M = S^2$, which is associated to the rank 2 vector bundle
$$\RR^2 \to TM \to M$$

Then $TM$ is trivial iff there are 2 independent global sections. Since there is a zero section, a second independent section must be everywhere-nonzero - however, this would be a nowhere vanishing vector field on $S^2$, which by the Hairy Ball theorem does not exist.

Alternate proof: such a vector field would allow a homotopy between the identity and the antipodal map on $S^2$, contradiction by basic homotopy theory.

# Filtration from a SES

The standard Serre fibration: $\Omega X \to PX \mapsvia{f} X$ where $\Omega X$ is the loop space, $PX$ is the path space, and $f$ is the "evaluation at the endpoint" map. Note that $PX$ is contractible!

Consider a SES $0 \to A \to B \to C \to C$, then look at it as a 2-step filtration of $B$ so 

- $F^0B = B$, 
- $F^1B = A$,
- $F^2B = 0$. 

The sections are $G_0 = C, G_1 = A$. Can use this to obtain LES from SS.

Homology in the ring-theoretic setting: If $R$ is a Noetherian ring and $I \subseteq R$, then if $I$ can be generated by $n$ elements then $H_I^i(M) = 0$ for any $R$-module $M$ and $i > n$. Thus to prove $I$ can *not* be generated by $n$ elements, it suffices to find a module $M$ where $H_I^{n+1} \neq 0$.


## Serre Spectral Sequence

Lots of good examples of computations [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serre_spectral_sequence).

Some fibrations

- Hopf: $S^1 \to S^3 \to S^2$
- $S^1 \to S^{2n+1} \to \CP^n$
- Path space: $\Omega S^n \to PS^n \to S^n$

# Representing $K(G, n)$ Geometrically

[(Summary of full material found here)](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week151.html)

Starting with a low-dimensional example, using the fact that $K(\ZZ, 2) = \CP^\infty = \varinjlim \CP^n$.

We want to make this into an abelian topological group, so let
$$
X = \theset{\CC \to \CC \mid f~\text{is rational}}
$$

Note that as a vector space, this is isomorphic to $\CC^\infty$, and there is a way to topologize $X$ such that this is a homeomorphism as well.

Then let
$$
\hat X = \theset{f \in X \mid f~\text{is nonzero}} / \theset{f = \lambda f \mid \lambda \in \CC^*}
$$

which is the set of rational, nonzero, complex functions, modulo multiplication by constants. This is the "projectivization" of $X$, and is isomorphic to $\CP^\infty$ as abelian topological groups.

Then every function $f\in \hat X$ has (say) $n$ zeros and $m$ poles, which corresponds to $n+m$ points in $\CC \cup \infty = \CP^1 = S^2$. If we attach an integer to every point, we can encode the difference between zeros and poles while simultaneously encoding their orders. So we then define

$$
Y_n = \theset{\theset{(z_i, k_i)}_{i=1}^n \mid \sum_{i=1}^n k_i = 0}\subset \CP^1 \cross \ZZ
$$

in which each element is a collections of $n$ points on the Riemann sphere, each with an integer attached, such that these integers sum to zero.

Then any rational complex function $f: \CC \to \CC$ with a total of $n$ combined zeros and poles can be uniquely recovered as some $y\in Y_n$, so we have

$$
\hat X \cong \union_{n=1}^\infty Y_n
$$

In other words, we perform the following procedure: each rational function has a finite number of zeros and poles, so we imagine these as points on the Riemann sphere, each with an integer attached such that the sum of these integers equals zero.

Then, we imagine wiggling these functions continuously - this induces movement of the points on the sphere. When any two points coincide, they "coalesce" and their correspdoning integer labels are added together.

We thus envision points in $K(\ZZ, 2) = \CP^\infty$ as collections of "particle-antiparticle" swarms on $S^2$:

There are two immediate generalizations:

- First, replace $S^2$ with $S^n$ to obtain a corresponding picture for $K(\ZZ, n)$
- Then, replace $\ZZ$ with an arbitrary abelian group. We then require that the aggregate word formed by all of the points multiples to the identity, and that coaslescing corresponds to multiplication of elements.

![group swarm](figures/group-swarm.png)

This yields a geometric picture for $K(G, n)$ for any abelian group $G$.

#homotopy #bundles #fibration #algebraic_topology

# Fiber Bundles

What is a fiber bundle? Generally speaking, it is similar to a fibration - we require the homotopy lifting property to hold, although it is not necessary that path lifting is unique.

However, it also satisfies more conditions - in particular, the condition of _local triviality_. This requires that the total space looks like a product locally, although there may some type of global monodromy. Thus with some mild conditions^[A fiber bundle $E \to B$ is a fibration when $B$ is paracompact.], fiber bundles will be instances of fibrations (or alternatively, fibrations are a generalization of fiber bundles, whichever you prefer!)

As with fibrations, we can interpret a fiber bundle as "a family of $B$s indexed/parameterized by $F$s", and the general shape data of a fiber bundle is similarly given by

\begin{tikzcd}
F \arrow[rr, hook] &  & E \arrow[dd, "\pi", two heads] \\
 &  &  \\
 &  & B \arrow[uu, "s", dotted, bend left]
\end{tikzcd}


where $B$ is the base space, $E$ is the total space, $\pi: E \to B$ is the projection map, and $F$ is "the" fiber (in this case, unique up to homeomorphism). Fiber bundles are often described in shorthand by the data $E \mapsvia{\pi}B$, or occasionally by tuples such as $(E, \pi, B)$.

The local triviality condition is a requirement that the projection $\pi$ locally factors through the product; that is, for each open set $U\in B$, there is a homeomorphism $\varphi$ making this diagram commute:

\begin{tikzcd}
\pi^{-1}(U) \arrow[dd, "\pi", two heads] \arrow[rr, "\varphi", dashed] &  & U\times F \arrow[lldd, "{(a,b) \mapsto a}"] \\
 &  &  \\
U &  &
\end{tikzcd}

Fiber bundles may admit right-inverses to the projection map $s: B\to E$ satisfying $\pi \circ s = \id_B$, denoted _sections_. Equivalently, for each $b\in B$, a section is a choice of an element $e$ in the preimage $\pi^{-1}(b) \homotopic F$ (i.e. the fiber over $b$). Sections are sometimes referred to as _cross-sections_ in older literature, due to the fact that a choice of section yields might be schematically represented as such:

![foliation diagram](figures/foliation-diagram.png)

Here, we imagine each fiber as a cross-section or "level set" of the total space, giving rise to a "foliation" of $E$ by the fibers.^[When $E$ is in fact a product $F\cross B$, this actually is a foliation in the technical sense.]

For a given bundle, it is generally possible to choose sections locally, but there may or may not exist globally defined sections. Thus one key question is **when does a fiber bunde admit a global section?**

A bundle is said to be _trivial_ if $E = F \cross B$, and so another important question is **when is a fiber bundle trivial?**

**Definition**: A fiber bundle in which $F$ is a $k\dash$vector space for some field $k$ is referred to as a _rank $n$ vector bundle._ When $k=\RR, \CC$, they are denoted real/complex vector bundles respectively. A vector bundle of rank $1$ is often referred to as a _line bundle_.


**Example**: There are in fact non-trivial fiber bundles. Consider the space $E$ that can appear as the total space in a line bundle over the circle

$$ \RR^1 \to E \to S^1$$

That is, the total spaces that occur when a one-dimensional real vector space (i.e. a real line) is chosen at each point of $S^1$. One possibility is the trivial bundle $E \cong S^1 \cross \RR \cong S^1 \cross I^\circ \in \text{DiffTop}$, which is an "open cylinder":

But another possibility is $E \cong M^\circ \in\text{DiffTop}$, an open Mobius band:

![mobius band](figures/mobius-band.png)

Here we can take the base space $B$ to be the circle through the center of the band; then every open neighborhood $U$ of a point $b\in B$ contains an arc of the center circle crossed with a vertical line segment that misses $\del M$. Thus the local picture looks like $S^1 \cross I^\circ$, while globally $M\not\cong S^1 \cross I^\circ \in \text{Top}$.^[Due to the fact that, for example, $M$ is nonorientable and orientability distinguishes topological spaces up to homeomorphism.]

So in terms of fiber bundles, we have the following situation

% https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMyxbMCwwLCJcXFJSIl0sWzIsMCwiTSJdLFsyLDIsIlNeMSJdLFsxLDJdLFswLDFdXQ==
\begin{tikzcd}
	\RR && M \\
	\\
	&& {S^1}
	\arrow[from=1-3, to=3-3]
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-3]
\end{tikzcd}

and thus $M$ is associated to a nontrivial line bundle over the circle.

---

**Remark:** In fact, these are the only two line bundles over $S^1$. This leads us to a natural question, similar to the group extension question: **given a base $B$ and fiber $F$, what are the isomorphism classes of fiber bundles over $B$ with fiber $F$?** In general, we will find that these classes manifest themselves in homology or homotopy. As an example, we have the following result:

**Notation**: Let $I(F, B)$ denote isomorphism classes of fiber bundles of the form $F \to \wait \to B$.

## Proposition:

The set of isomorphism classes of smooth line bundles over a space $B$ satisfies the following isomorphism of abelian groups:

$$I(\RR^1, B) \cong H^1(B; \ZZ_2) \in \text{Ab}$$

in which the RHS is generated by the first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_1(B)$.

_Proof:_

_Lemma:_ The structure group of a vector bundle is a general linear group. (Or orthogonal group, by Gram-Schmidt)

_Lemma:_ The classifying space of $\GL(n, \RR)$ is $\Gr(n, \RR^\infty)$

_Lemma_: $\Gr(n, \RR^\infty) = \RP^\infty \homotopic K(\ZZ_2, 1)$

_Lemma:_ For $G$ an abelian group and $X$ a CW complex, $[X, K(G, n)] \cong H^n(X; G)$

The structure group of a vector bundle can be taken to be either the general linear group or the orthogonal group, and the classifying space of both groups are homotopy-equivalent to an infinite real Grassmanian.

$$
I(\RR^1, B) &= [B, \B\Aut_{\Vect}(\RR)]\\
&= [B, \B\GL(1, \RR)]\\
&= [B, \Gr_1(\RR^\infty)] \\
&= [B, \RP^\infty] \\
&= [B, K(\ZZ/2, 1)] \\
&= H^1(B; \ZZ/2)
$$


This is the general sort of pattern we will find - isomorphism classes of bundles will be represented by homotopy classes of maps into classifying spaces, and for nice enough classifying spaces, these will represent elements in cohomology.

**Corollary**: 
There are two isomorphism classes of line bundles over $S^1$, generated by the Mobius strip, since $H^1(S^1, \ZZ_2) = \ZZ_2$ (Note: this computation follows from the fact that $H_1(S^1) = \ZZ$ and an application of both universal coefficient theorems.)

**Note:** 
The Stiefel-Whitney class is only a complete invariant of _line_ bundles over a space. It is generally an incomplete invariant; for higher dimensions or different types of fibers, other invariants (so-called _characteristic classes_) will be necessary.

Another important piece of data corresponding to a fiber bundle is the _structure group_, which is a subgroup of $\text{Sym}(F) \in \text{Set}$ and arises from imposing conditions on the structure of the transition functions between local trivial patches. A fiber bundle with structure group $G$ is referred to as a _$G\dash$bundle_.

> See next: [2021-04-25_vector_bundles_ug](2021-04-25_vector_bundles_ug.md)

What is a fiber bundle? Generally speaking, it is similar to a fibration - we require the homotopy lifting property to hold, although it is not necessary that path lifting is unique.
![lifting - todo tikz](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/Homotopy_lifting_property.png)

However, it also satisfies more conditions - in particular, the condition of _local triviality_. This requires that the total space looks like a product locally, although there may some type of global monodromy. Thus with some mild conditions^[A fiber bundle $E \to B$ is a fibration when $B$ is paracompact.], fiber bundles will be instances of fibrations (or alternatively, fibrations are a generalization of fiber bundles, whichever you prefer!)

As with fibrations, we can interpret a fiber bundle as "a family of $B$s indexed/parameterized by $F$s", and the general shape data of a fiber bundle is similarly given by

```latex {cmd=true, hide=true, run_on_save=true}

	 &  &  \\
	 &  & B \arrow[uu, "s", dotted, bend left]
	\end{tikzcd}
}
\end{document}
```

where $B$ is the base space, $E$ is the total space, $\pi: E \to B$ is the projection map, and $F$ is "the" fiber (in this case, unique up to homeomorphism). Fiber bundles are often described in shorthand by the data $E \mapsvia{\pi}B$, or occasionally by tuples such as $(E, \pi, B)$.

The local triviality condition is a requirement that the projection $\pi$ locally factors through the product; that is, for each open set $U\in B$, there is a homeomorphism $\varphi$ making this diagram commute:

```latex {cmd=true, hide=true}

	 &  &  \\
	U &  &
	\end{tikzcd}
}
\end{document}
```

Fiber bundles may admit right-inverses to the projection map $s: B\to E$ satisfying $\pi \circ s = \id_B$, denoted *sections*. Equivalently, for each $b\in B$, a section is a choice of an element $e$ in the preimage $\pi^{-1}(b) \homotopic F$ (i.e. the fiber over $b$). Sections are sometimes referred to as _cross-sections_ in older literature, due to the fact that a choice of section yields might be schematically represented as such:

![foliation diagram](figures/foliation-diagram.png)

Here, we imagine each fiber as a cross-section or "level set" of the total space, giving rise to a "foliation" of $E$ by the fibers.^[When $E$ is in fact a product $F\cross B$, this actually is a foliation in the technical sense.]

For a given bundle, it is generally possible to choose sections locally, but there may or may not exist globally defined sections. Thus one key question is **when does a fiber bundle admit a global section?**

A bundle is said to be *trivial* if $E = F \cross B$, and so another important question is **when is a fiber bundle trivial?**

**Definition**: A fiber bundle in which $F$ is a $k\dash$vector space for some field $k$ is referred to as a _rank $n$ vector bundle._ When $k=\RR, \CC$, they are denoted real/complex vector bundles respectively. A vector bundle of rank $1$ is often referred to as a _line bundle_.


**Example**: There are in fact non-trivial fiber bundles. Consider the space $E$ that can appear as the total space in a line bundle over the circle

$$ \RR^1 \to E \to S^1$$

That is, the total spaces that occur when a one-dimensional real vector space (i.e. a real line) is chosen at each point of $S^1$. One possibility is the trivial bundle $E \cong S^1 \cross \RR \cong S^1 \cross I^\circ \in \text{DiffTop}$, which is an "open cylinder":

But another possibility is $E \cong M^\circ \in\text{DiffTop}$, an open Möbius band:

![Möbius band](figures/mobius-band.png)

Here we can take the base space $B$ to be the circle through the center of the band; then every open neighborhood $U$ of a point $b\in B$ contains an arc of the center circle crossed with a vertical line segment that misses $\del M$. Thus the local picture looks like $S^1 \cross I^\circ$, while globally $M\not\cong S^1 \cross I^\circ \in \text{Top}$.^[Due to the fact that, for example, $M$ is nonorientable and orientability distinguishes topological spaces up to homeomorphism.]

So in terms of fiber bundles, we have the following situation
$$
\begin{array}
&\RR &\to &~~~M &\to &S^1\\
\require{HTML} \style{display: inline-block; transform: rotate(90deg)}{=} &&~~~\require{HTML} \style{display: inline-block; transform: rotate(90deg)}{\neq} &&\require{HTML} \style{display: inline-block; transform: rotate(90deg)}{=}\\
\RR &\to &S^1 \cross I^\circ &\to &S^1
\end{array}
$$

and thus $M$ is associated to a nontrivial line bundle over the circle.

**Remark:** In fact, these are the only two line bundles over $S^1$. This leads us to a natural question, similar to the group extension question: **given a base $B$ and fiber $F$, what are the isomorphism classes of fiber bundles over $B$ with fiber $F$?** In general, we will find that these classes manifest themselves in homology or homotopy.

The structure group of a vector bundle can be taken to be either the general linear group or the orthogonal group, and the classifying space of both groups are homotopy-equivalent to an infinite real Grassmanian.
$$\begin{align}

# Classifying Spaces

**Definition:** A _principal $G\dash$ bundle_ is a fiber bundle $F \to E \to B$ in which for each fiber $\pi^{-1}(b)\definedas F_b$, satisfying the condition that $G$ acts freely and transitively on $F_b$. In other words, there is a continuous group action $\actson: E\cross G \to E$ such that for every $f \in F_b$ and $g\in G$, we have $g\actson f \in F_b$ and $g\actson f \neq f$.

**Example:** A covering space $\hat X \mapsvia{p} X$ yields a principal $\pi_1(X)\dash$ bundle.

_Remark_: A consequence of this is that each $F_b \cong G \in \text{TopGrp}$ (which may also be taken as the definition). Furthermore, each $F_b$ is then a _homogeneous space_, i.e. a space with a transitive group action $G\actson F_b$ making $F_b \cong G/G_x$.

_Remark_: Although each fiber $F_b$ is isomorphic to $G$, there is no preferred identity element in $F_b$. Locally, one can form a local section by choosing some $e\in F_b$ to serve as the identity, but the fibers can only be given a global group structure iff the bundle is trivial. This property is expressed by saying $F_b$ is a _$G\dash$ torsor_.

_Remark_: Every fiber bundle $F\to E\to B$ is a principal $\Aut(F)\dash$ fiber bundle. Also, in local trivializations, the transition functions are elements of $G$.

**Proposition**: A principal bundle is trivial iff it admits a global section. Thus all principal vector bundles are trivial, since the zero section always exists.

**Definition:** A principal bundle $F \to E \mapsvia{\pi} B$ is _universal_ iff $E$ is weakly contractible, i.e. if $E$ has the homotopy type of a point.

**Definition:** Given a topological group $G$, a _classifying space_, denoted $BG$, is the base space of a universal principal $G\dash$ bundle
$$
G \to EG \mapsvia{\pi} BG
$$
making $BG$ a quotient of the contractible space $EG$ by a $G\dash$ action. We shall refer to this as _the classifying bundle_.

Classifying spaces satisfy the property that any other principal $G\dash$ bundle over a space $X$ is isomorphic to a pullback of the classifying bundle along a map $X \to BG$.


Let $I(G, X)$ denote the set of isomorphism classes of principal $G\dash$ bundles over a base space $X$, then
$$
I(G, X) \cong [X, BG]_{\text{hoTop}}
$$
So in other words, isomorphism classes of principal $G\dash$ bundles over a base $X$ are equivalent to homotopy classes of maps from $X$ into the classifying space of $G$.


**Proposition**: Grassmanians are classifying spaces for vector bundles. That is, there is a bijective correspondence:
$$
[X, \Gr(n, \RR)] \cong \theset{\text{isomorphism classes of rank $n$ $\RR\dash$vector bundles over $X$}}
$$
It is also the case that every such vector bundle is a pullback of the principal bundle
$$
\GL(n, \RR) \to V_n(\RR^\infty) \to \Gr(n, \RR)
$$

Usually look at this in the context of a topological group $G$, and denote $BG$ the classifying space of $G$. It is the quotient of some contractible space $EG$ by a free action of $G$, so we have something that looks like $G \to EG \to BG$ and $BG = EG/G$.

For a discrete group $G$, we have $BG = K(G,1)$, so that $\pi_1(BG) = G$ and $\pi_k(BG) = 0$ for $k \neq 1$.

*Question: what is a principal bundle? According to Wikipedia, any G-principal bundle is a pullback of $EG \to BG$.*

Note that contractibility of $EG$ shows that $BG$ is $K(G, 1)$.

## Examples

Note that $EG$ is always a contractible space upon which $G$ acts freely.

We also have $BX \homotopic \Omega X$

- $G \to EG \to BG = EG/G$
- $\ZZ \to \RR \to S^1$
- $\ZZ^n \to \RR^n \to T^n$
- $\ZZ^{\ast n} \to ??? \to \bigvee_n S^1$
- $\ZZ_2 \to S^\infty \to \RP^\infty$
- $\ZZ_n \to S^\infty \to L_n^\infty$
- $S^0 \to S^\infty \to \RP^\infty$
- $S^1 \to S^\infty \to \CP^\infty$
- $S^3 \to S^\infty \to \HP^\infty$
- NOT TRUE: $S^7 \to S^\infty \to \OP^\infty$
- $T^n \to ? \to (\CP^\infty)^n$
- $O_n \to V_n(\RR^\infty) \to Gr_n(\RR^\infty)$
- $GL_n(\RR) \to V_n(\RR^\infty) \to Gr_n(\RR^\infty)$
- $SO_n \to ? \to ?$
- $Gr_n(\RR^\infty) \to ? \to Gr_n(\RR^\infty)$
- $\pi_1(\Sigma_g) \to ? \to \Sigma_g$
- $S_n \to ??? \to \theset{U \subset \RR^\infty,~ |U| = n}$


Note that $V_n(X)$ is the Stiefel manifold of dimension $n$ orthonormal frames in $X$.

Also, $\pi_1(\Sigma_g) = <\theset{a_i, b_i}_i^n> \mid \prod_i^g [a_i, b_i]>$

A principal $G$ bundle is a locally trivial free $G$-space with orbit space $B$. If $G$ is discrete, then a principal $G$-bundle over $X$ with total space $\tilde X$ is equivalent to a regular covering map with $Aut(\tilde X) = G$. Under some hypothesis, there exists a classifying space $BG$ such that $\theset{ \text{isomorphism classes of G-bundles over X}} \cong [X, BG]$, i.e. bundles of $G$'s over $X$ are equivalent to maps from $X$ into the classifying space, i.e. $$\hom(X, BG) \cong \theset{G\dash\text{bundles over } X}$$

It is useful to think of $BG$ as a space whose points are copies of $G$, so the classifying map $X \mapsvia{f} BG$ assigns each $x \in X$ to the fiber above $x$, which is a $G$.

There is a standard procedure in homotopy theory for constructing a classifying space for every group. One starts by constructing a 2-complex with the given fundamental group, and then one inductively attaches higher dimensional cells to kill all higher homotopy groups. Each element $c\in \pi_n(X_{n−1})$ is represented by some continuous map $\gamma_c:S^n\to X_{n−1}$ with image in the $n\dash$-skeleton. Let $X_n$ be obtained from $X_{n−1}$ by attaching an $(n+1)\dash$cell along $\gamma_c$, for each $c\in π_n(X_{n−1})$.

Conjecture: $B(G \cross H) = BG \cross BH$
Proof outline: $EG \cross EH$ is contractible, and $G \cross H$ acts freely on it with quotient equal to the RHS.

Conjecture: $B(G \ast H) = BG \vee BH$

Unknown: $B(G \tensor H) = BG \tensor BH$

Unknown: $B(G \semidirect_\phi H) = ?$

Characteristic classes are elements of $H^*(BG)$, can be used to define characteristic classes for bundles.

Connected covers can kill higher homotopy?

You can realize any Eilenberg-MacLane space as a classifying space.

Claim: $\pi_{i+k}B^kG = \pi_i G$.

Proof: If $G$ is a topological group, there is a universal principal $G\dash$bundle $EG \to BG$ which induces a LES in homotopy. Since $EG$ is contractible, $\pi_i EG = \pi_{i+1}EG = 0$, so $\pi_{i+1}BG \cong \pi_i G$. When $G$ is an $E_2$ space, $BG$ is a topological group, and so $\pi_{i+2}(B^2G) = \pi_{i+2}(B(BG)) = \pi_{i+1}(BG) = \pi_i(G)$ and we conclude the result.

Corollary: If $G$ is a discrete group, $B^kG = K(G, n)$.
Proof: Then $\pi_0 G = G$ and $\pi_i G = 0$ for $i > 0$, so $\pi_k B^k G = G$.

It's possible to take classifying spaces of stacks. E.g. there is a stack that classifies principal bundles *with connections*, but it has issues: it is not a presentable stack, i.e. not covered by a manifold, so an associated sheaf is not representable.

Stable homotopy of $BG$: same sort of techniques as in $S^n$, break into components.

$EG$ can be constructed as $\bigcup_n G \ast G \ast \cdots \ast G$, where $\ast$ is join of two spaces: the suspension of the smash product. For example, $G = \ZZ_2$ implies $EG = \bigcup_n \ZZ_2 \ast \cdots = \bigcup_n S^{n-1} = S^\infty$.

# Classifying the Homotopy Category of Spaces

The point of this note is to reword and fill in some details in [Akhil Mathew's post](https://amathew.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/eilenberg-maclane-spaces/amp/)

## Types

To fix some terminology, if we have fixed category $\mathcal{C}$, given an object $X\in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$, we define its **$\mathcal{C}\dash$type** $[X]$ to be the set of all objects $X' \in \Ob(\mathcal{C})$ that admit an isomorphism $f\in \hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X, X')$.
For example, in the category $\mathcal{C} = \Top$ of topological spaces and homeomorphisms, we'll say that $X$ has a unique corresponding *homeomorphism* type, where we identify $X$ with any space it is homeomorphic to.
Similarly, in the homotopy category of topological spaces $\hoTop$, we identify$X$ with all spaces homotopy-equivalent to $X$, and denote the class of all such spaces $[X]$.
We often abuse notation, however, and simply write $X$ in places of $[X]$.

We start off with a basic question:

:::{.question}
Given a category $\mathcal{C}$, how much data about an object $X$ is needed to uniquely specify its $\mathcal{C}\dash$type $[X]$? 
:::
This data, if it exists, will be referred to as a *complete set of invariants* for $\mathcal{C}$.

One example that doesn't admit an easy answer is $\mathcal{C} = \Top$, where I'm not sure if there are any clear results along these lines. 
In fact, I'd expect that this is the case for most categories of interest!
A slightly more tractable example is $\mathcal{C} = \hoTop$, where it will turn out there is relatively small set of data that determines the homotopy type of a space completely, i.e. there does indeed exist a known complete set of invariants in this category.
One critical ingredient is the computation of $\pi_*(X)$.

## Homotopy Groups

First recall that a homeomorphism induces a homotopy equivalence, and conversely if two spaces are *not* homotopy equivalent then they can not be homeomorphic.
So let's reduce to this one piece of the problem: suppose we are given a pointed topological space $(X, x_0)$ (where $x_0$ is some choice of a basepoint) and we wish to compute the graded group structure of the homotopy groups
\[
\pi_*(X) \da \bigoplus_{j=1}^\infty \pi(X; x_0)
\]

Why do this?
The easy answer is because this is the clearest obstruction to two spaces being homotopy equivalent -- if $\pi_*(X) \neq \pi_*(X')$, then we can possibly have $X\simeq X'$, and thus $[X], [X']$ are two distinct homotopy types.

Since $\pi_*$ is functorial, any homeomorphism $f \in \hom_{\Top}(X, X')$ will induce a homotopy equivalence $f_*^h \in \hom_{\hoTop}(X, X')$ and an isomorphism $f_* \in \hom_{\gr\Grp}( \pi_*(X), \pi_*(X'))$ of graded groups, so this provides some invariant of homeomorphism types of spaces.
However, we should be careful to note that $\pi_*$ is not a *complete* invariant of the topological type of $X$ -- that is, we can generally construct spaces $X'$ that are homotopy-equivalent to $X$ but not *homeomorphic* to $X$.
They will however provide partial information that will allow us to find obstructions to homotopy equivalences and thus homeomorphisms.

Moreover, in this process we will determine what extra information is needed to in fact obtain a *complete* set of homotopy invariants for $X$.
In other words, we hope to answer the question of how much data it takes to uniquely specify $[X]$, the homotopy type of $X$.

We'll restrict our attention first to the subcategory of CW complexes.
Why is this a good move at this point? 
We have the following theorem:

:::{.theorem title="CW Approximation"}
Todo
:::

From this, nice enough spaces $X$ will admit a weak equivalence to some CW complex $X'$, and so $\pi_*(X) \cong \pi_*(X')$.
So if we're just interested in computing homotopy groups, this is a harmless step.
But there is in fact a strict advantage:
we have many nice tools and theorems that specifically work for CW complexes.
So we implicitly work in this subcategory from here onward.
The very first thing we'll do is replace $X$ with a CW complex $\tilde X$ that is homotopy-equivalent to $X$, and we'll immediately abuse notation by just writing $X$ for $\tilde X$ everywhere.

## Eilenberg-MacLane Spaces: The Atoms of Homotopy Theory

For any group $G$, suppose for a moment that there existed a space $K(G,n)$ (where $n$ is a natural numbers) satisfying
$$
\pi_i(K(G,n)) = \begin{cases}
G, & i = n \\
0, & \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$
where $0$ denotes the trivial group. If such a space existed, this would perhaps be the simplest type
of object to work with within homotopy theory -- it has exactly one homotopy group concentrated in one
dimension. We will show later that not only does such a space exist, and can be constructed in a
relatively straightforward manner, but also that it is unique up to homotopy-equivalence, and are
thus referred to as *Eilenberg-MacLane spaces*.

## Assembling the Atoms

For the moment, let's focus on one particular degree on homotopy groups, say $G = \pi_i(X)$.
Note that for our original space, if we make the assumption that
$G$ is finitely generated, we can appeal to the classification of (finitely generated) abelian groups and write
$G \cong \ZZ^n \bigoplus_{j=1}^m \ZZ_{k_j}$ for some $n$ and some $m$. That is, it decomposes as a
free group of rank $n$, along with a sum of finite cyclic groups with orders given
by the invariant factors $k_j$. As an aside, it is perhaps worth mentioning that $\pi_i(X)$ is abelian for $n\geq 2$, so the
categorical product and coproduct (here the direct sum) will coincide. This leaves the $i=1$ case; however,
the fundamental group can generally be computed using more elementary methods such as covering space theory
and Van Kampen's theorem.

So we've come up with the "atoms" that we might hope to build spaces out of, and we've realized that we can break
any given homotopy group of $X$ into free and cyclic groups. The strategy now is to see if we can work out what kind of spaces $K(\ZZ^n, i)$ and $K(\ZZ_k, i)$ are, and hope we can prove a theorem that says something like $K(G_1, i) \oplus K(G_2, i) =K(G_1 \oplus G_2, i)$. If we can do this, we now have a method of constructing a space that has the same homotopy groups as $X$ in degree $i$. If we can then show something like
$$
\pi_i(K(G_1, j) \oplus K(G_2, k)) = \begin{cases}
G_1, & i = j \\
G_2, & i = k \\
0, & \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$
then we will be in business. Explicitly, splitting the homotopy groups of $X$ up by degree and writing
$$\pi_*(X) = \bigoplus_{i=1}^\infty \pi_i(X),$$
we could assemble a space $X'$ that has the exact same homotopy groups $X$ by taking
\[
X' = \bigvee_{i=1}^\infty K(\pi_i(X), i).
\]

What does this buy us? It's not quite the case that $X' \homotopic X$, since having isomorphic
homotopy groups alone is insufficient to guarantee homotopy equivalence. A standard counterexample
here are the spaces $S^2\cross \RP^3$ and $S^3 \cross \RP^2$; one in fact needs a single map *inducing*
all of the isomorphisms on homotopy groups simultaneously for this kind of result to hold.

So the naive hope of writing $X$ as a product of simple spaces won't work. As it turns out, what we
*can* get is a way to write $X$ in a way that's often referred to as a "twisted" product, which is formalized in
the notion of a (Serre) fibration.

## Twisted Products

It's perhaps worth spelling out exactly what "twisted product" means here, since it's often glossed over.
Suppose we have a fibration $F \injects E \mapsvia{p} B$ which is in fact a fiber bundle -- note that this is
a strictly stronger condition, requiring the fibration to have *local trivialization*. This amounts to
asking that for every open neighborhood $U \in B$, we have $p^{-1}(B) = F \cross B$ up to homeomorphism. This
is of course strictly weaker than requiring $E\cong F\cross B$ globally, which would be denoted a trivial
bundle; there may in fact be monodromy in the total space $E$ that topologically distinguishes it from
this product. A primary example of this phenomenon is the Mobius bundle,

\begin{tikzcd}
I \ar[r, hook] & \RR \ar[d, ->>] \\
 &  S^1 \\
\end{tikzcd}

which is a line bundle over the circle. 
Note that locally we do have $M \cong S^1 \cross I$, but since $M$ is not homeomorphic to a cylinder, this produces a nontrivial bundle. There is instead a global "twist",
arising from the fact $M$ is nonorientable and parallel-transporting a small arc in $M$ once around the core
circle is not the identity map.
By a somewhat non-precise abuse of notation, one might instead write something like
$M \cong S^1 \semidirect_\varphi I$, indicating that this is a nontrivial bundle. One could further
ask, given a base $B$ and a fiber $F$, how many distinct nontrivial bundles $F \to E \to B$ exist,
which is a bit far afield for us now but leads to the rich and fruitful theory classifying spaces.

The moral of the story here is that we can generalize a product of spaces $A \times B \times C \times \cdots$
as a "twisted product" $A \semidirect_{\varphi_1} B  \semidirect_{\varphi_1} C  \semidirect_{\varphi_1} \cdots$
by constructing an interlocking series of fibrations. Luckily for us, our next step towards
solving our original problem will involve the construction of Postnikov towers, which explicitly
encode how this interlocking works.

## Postnikov Towers

First I want to define exactly what a Postnikov tower is and how we can explicitly build them using
CW complexes, since this is something that is treated differently among different sources.


:::{.definition title="Postnikov Tower"}
The data is a Postnikov tower is a sequence of spaces $\theset{X_i}$ equipped with maps $p_n: X_n \to X_{n-1}$,
where each $p_n$ is a fibration, and
$$
\pi_i(X_n) =
\begin{cases}
\pi_i(X), & i \leq n \\
0, & i > n.
\end{cases}
$$
such that the following diagram commutes:

\begin{tikzcd}
\vdots                                           &  & \vdots \arrow[d, "p_{n+2}"', two heads] \arrow[rrdddd, dotted] &  &   \\
{K(\pi_{n+2}X, n+3)} \arrow[rr, "k_{n+3}", hook] &  & X_{n+1} \arrow[d, "p_{n+1}"', two heads] \arrow[rrddd]         &  &   \\
{K(\pi_{n+1}X, n+2)} \arrow[rr, "k_{n+2}", hook] &  & X_n \arrow[rrdd]                                               &  &   \\
\vdots                                           &  & \vdots \arrow[d, "p_1"', two heads]                            &  &   \\
{K(\pi_2X, 3)} \arrow[rr, "k_3", hook]           &  & X_1 \arrow[rr]                                                 &  & X
\end{tikzcd}
The maps $k_i$ are known as the **$k\dash$invariants** of $X$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Note that we have fibrations
\begin{tikzcd}
K(\pi_{i+1}(X), i+2) \ar[r] & X_i\ar[d] \\
 &  X_{i-1}\\
\end{tikzcd}
for all $i > 1$, and so using our earlier notation we can suggestively write
$X_i \cong K(\pi_{i+1}(X) \semidirect X_{i-1}$. It also turns out there is a weak
equivalence $X \to \lim_i X_i$, and so carrying this out inductively allows us to write
$$
X \homotopic K(\pi_{1}(X),2) \semidirect   K(\pi_{2}(X),3) \semidirect   K(\pi_{3}(X),4) \semidirect  \cdots
$$

yielding our "twisted product".

:::



This spaces can be constructed by a relatively easy process. 
If $X$ already has the homotopy type of a $CW$ complex, first let $X_i = X^{(i)}$, the $i\dash$skeleton of $X$. 
Since every finitely-generated group has a presentation, we can write $\pi_{i+1}(X) = \generators{a, b, c, \cdots} / \generators{R_1, R_2, \cdots}$ where $a,b,c,\cdots$ are generators and $R_i$ are relations.


The point of this note is to reword and fill in some details in [Akhil Mathew's post](https://amathew.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/eilenberg-maclane-spaces/amp/)
# The Setup

We start with a very general problem: suppose we are given a topological space $X$ and wish to compute
$\pi_*(X)$. Although the homotopy groups themselves are not a complete invariant of $X$ -- that is, we can
generally construct spaces that are homotopy-equivalent to $X$ but not homeomorphic --
this will get us partially there. Moreover, in this process we will determine what extra information
is needed to in fact obtain a *complete* set of invariants for $X$.

The very first thing we'll do is replace $X$ with a CW complex that is homotopy-equivalent to $X$. By
the CW approximation theorem, we can do this for any space $X$, and since many theorems are much nicer
for CW complexes than arbitrary spaces, we implicitly work in this subcategory from here on.

For any group $G$, suppose for a moment that there existed a space $K(G,n)$ (where $n$ is a natural numbers) satisfying
$$
\pi_i(K(G,n)) = \begin{cases}
G, & i = n \\
0, & \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$
where $0$ denotes the trivial group. If such a space existed, this would perhaps be the simplest type
of object to work with within homotopy theory -- it has exactly one homotopy group concentrated in one
dimension. We will show later that not only does such a space exist, and can be constructed in a
relatively straightforward manner, but also that it is unique up to homotopy-equivalence, and are
thus referred to as *Eilenberg-MacLane spaces*.

Note that for our original space, if we make the assumption that
$G$ is finitely generated, we can appeal to the classification of (finitely generated) abelian groups and write

If we can do this, we now have a method of constructing a space that has the same homotopy groups as $X$ in degree $i$. If we can then show something like
$$
\pi_i(K(G_1, j) \oplus K(G_2, k)) = \begin{cases}
G_1, & i = j \\
G_2, & i = k \\
0, & \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$
then we will be in business. Explicitly, splitting the homotopy groups of $X$ up by degree and writing
$$\pi_*(X) = \bigoplus_{i=1}^\infty \pi_i(X),$$
we could construct a space $X'$ that has the exact same homotopy groups $X$ by taking

## Notes

- Syntax: make sure you're doing well-defined things with mathematical objects. 
  E.g. it doesn't *a priori* make sense to add a set and a number, or a set and a polynomial, or take the union of a polynomial and a set.


- To show a set $X$ is countable, you need a countable set $S$ (e.g. $S = \NN$) an either an injection $X\injects S$ or a surjection $S \surjects X$.
  - Note that any old map won't suffice: the existence of the inclusion map $\QQ \injects \RR$ doesn't show that $\RR$ is countable.
  - To avoid mistakes, it's good to try to explicitly write out the sets and say what the map does to elements. 

- If you say something is an injection/surjection/bijection, it usually warrants a proof (sometimes short).
  Common mistake: describing a map and saying it's a one-to-one correspondence without much or any justification.

- Note that a *countable* union of countable sets is again countable, but not an *arbitrary* union.
  Counterexample: For each $\alpha\in \RR$ define $B_5(\alpha) = \ts{x\in \RR \st \abs{x-\alpha} < 5} \intersect \ZZ$.
  Then $\abs{B_5(\alpha)} \leq 11$ for any $\alpha$, so it's in fact *finite*, but $\union_{\alpha\in \RR} B_5(\alpha) = \RR$ is uncountable.

- If saying something is e.g. a countable union of countable sets, try to write out the union, e.g. $A = \bigcup_{n\in \NN} A_n$.

## General Notes

- Say what you're assuming at the start of the proof.
  - If flipping logic and not using a direct proof (contradiction, contrapositive, etc), then signpost/announce it near the beginning of the proof.
  - Examples: for $P\implies Q$,
    - Direct proof: "Suppose $P \cdots$"
    - Contradiction: "Suppose toward a contradiction $P$ but not $Q\cdots$" 

      (Usually show $\lnot P$. If you show $Q$, a direct proof might be simpler.)
    - Contrapositive: "Suppose by contrapositive that $\lnot Q$ holds, $\cdots$"

- Put any important equations (i.e. major steps of the proof) on their own lines or in displaymath environments.
- Use some whitespace to separate parts of the proof and increase readability.
- Remember that limits of sequences need not exist, but liminfs/limsups always do 
  
  (just may be $\pm \infty$).

- Try to avoid abbreviating the names of major theorems (example: "AP" can stand for many results, not just the Archimedean property!)
- It's not generally true that $a\leq M \implies \abs{a} \leq M$, e.g. take $a=-1 \leq M = 0$. 
  This only holds for $a\geq 0$.

- A generic set **may not** contain its inf or sup. 
  Example: $\inf \ts{1\over n} = 0$ and $0\not\in \ts{1\over n}$, or $\sup \ts{1-{1\over n}} = 1$ with $1\not \in \ts{1-{1\over n}}$.

- If there exists some element of a set or sequence with a given property, try to say where it comes from and why the property holds for it.
- Similarly, if a property holds for all elements of a set or sequence, try to say why.

- The crux of many proofs are certain inequalities, so try to justify every inequality that appears. 
- If you use a theorem, be sure to mention it by its full name.
- Useful counterexamples:
  - $x_n = (-1)^n$
  - Literal lists of numbers: $[0, 1, 0, 2, \cdots]$.

  - Note that $\inf S \da \liminf_{n\to\infty} x_n$ by definition (i).
- Let $\ts{x_{n_k}}\in S$ be an arbitrary convergent subsequence (since we are only concerned about subsequences with well-defined limits).
- Then for every $k$ we have $x_{n_k} \in \ts{x_n}$, so
\[  
\abs{x_{n_k}} \leq M

- By order limit laws,
\[  
\abs{x_{n_k}} \leq M \implies 
\lim_{k\to\infty} \abs{x_{n_k}} \leq M

- Since the map $x\mapsto \abs{x}$ is continuous, using the sequential definition of continuity we can pass the limit through the absolute value to obtain
\[  
\abs{ \lim_{k\to\infty} x_{n_k}} \leq M
.\]

- Since the subsequence was arbitrary, we find that $M$ is an upper bound for $S$ and so $\sup S \leq M$.

\[  
\inf S \leq \sup S \leq M \implies \inf S \leq M

- Then for all $N$ there exists an $n> N$ with $x_n \leq \beta$, so the set $$B \da \ts{n \in \NN \st x_n \leq \beta}$$ is countably infinite.

- But then $B_n\subseteq \ts{k\in \NN \st k\geq n}$ for every $n$ implies that
\[  
\inf_{k\geq n} x_k \leq \inf_{k\in B_n} x_k \leq \beta \qquad \forall n

  since an infimum over a larger set can only get smaller. 


- Applying order-limit laws, we then have
\[  
\inf_{k\geq n} \leq \beta \,\,\forall n \implies \lim_{n\to \infty}\inf_{k\geq n} x_n \leq \beta

## 4.a

:::{.proof}
\hfill
- Suppose $\ts{x_n}$ is bounded and $\limsup \abs{x_n} = 0$.
- Then using the supremum definition, $\lim_{n\to\infty} \sup_{k\geq n} \abs{x_k} = 0$.
- Note that
\[  
\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = 0 \iff \forall \eps \quad \exists N \text{ such that } n\geq N \implies \abs{x_n} < \eps
.\]
- So let $\eps>0$ be arbitrary.
- By the definition of the limit appearing in the $\limsup$, there exists an $N_0$ such that 
$$n\geq N_0 \implies \sup_{k\geq n} \abs{x_k} < \eps.$$
- But then taking $N = N_0$ in the first equation yields the result, since
\[  
n\geq N_0 \implies \abs{x_n} \leq \sup_{k\geq n} \abs{x_k} < \eps
.\]
:::


## 4.c

:::{.proof}
\hfill
- Note that $-1 \leq \sin(x) \leq 1$ and $\sin(x) = \pm 1 \iff x = 2k\pi \pm {\pi \over 2}$.
- Since $\pi$ is irrational, $\sin(n)$ will never be of this form, so $-1 < \sin(n) < 1$.
- Taking floors, we have $-1 \leq \floor{\sin(n)} \leq 0$, which in fact means that $\sin(n) \in \ts{-1, 0}$ can only take on one of two values.
- The set of subsequential limits is then just $\ts{-1, 0}$.
- **Claim**: $\limsup \floor{\sin(n)} = 0$.
  - It suffices to show that $\floor{\sin(n)} = 0$ infinitely often
  - But note that there is an integer in any interval of the form $[2k\pi, 2k\pi + \pi]$ for $k\in \NN$, since it is of length $\pi > 1$.
  - In these intervals, $0 < \sin(n)  < 1$, and so $\floor{\sin(n)} = 0$, and there infinitely many such intervals.
  - So form a subsequence $x_{n_k} = \floor{\sin(n_k)}$ by choosing $n_k$ to be any integer in 
- **Claim**: $\liminf \floor{\sin(n)} = -1$.
  - By the exact same argument applied to intervals of the form $[3k\pi,3k\pi + \pi]$ where $-1 < \sin(n) < 0$, we find that $\floor{\sin(n)} = -1$ infinitely often.

The argument is pretty clean, and the paper is only 8 pages: <https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/adamatiy.pdf>

Interesting question in arithmetic statistics: for $G \in \Grp$ finite, how many Galois extensions are there $K/\QQ$ with $G = \Gal(K/\QQ)$ and $\Delta \leq N$ for some fixed $N$?


:::{.example title="?"}
\envlist

- For $G=\ZZ/2$, it is $O(N)$.
- For $G=\ZZ/3$, it is $O(\sqrt N )$.
:::

One can ask a similar question about $\Cl(K)$ for $G\in \Ab$, or replacing $\QQ$ with function fields $\FF_q(t)$ for $q=p^n$, and ask questions about frequency of primes ramifying, splitting, or remaining inert.

Cool fact: there is an equivalence of categories between finitely-generated extensions $K/k$ with $\trdeg(K/k) = 1$ and regular projective curves $C_{/k}$.
The (reverse) functor is the one sending a curve $C$ to its function field $k(C)$.

Hurwitz spaces come up here!

> Some old notes from March 10th, 2020

I talked to [Erik Schreyer](https://erikschreyer.wordpress.com/) today about some of the research he did with his advisor [Jason Cantarella](http://www.jasoncantarella.com/wordpress/), including his dissertation work (which he spoke about in the Geometry seminar last week) and a few other papers.

His dissertation work involved a cool way to represent arbitrary planar curves by *piecewise circular* arcs:

![image-20200310232110171](/home/zack/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20200310232110171.png)

From what I understand, this involves fixing a curve (blue), choosing a collection of circles $C_1, \cdots C_n$ (black) such that each $C_i$ intersects $C_{i+1}$ in at least one distinguished point $p_i$ (pink). The curve traced out by following an arc on $C_i$ and switching to circle $C_{i+1}$ at $p_i$ is intended to yield a good approximation to the original curve, with certain regularity conditions at the $p_i$ (such as the first derivatives along both arcs agreeing at the point).

Erik's work actually seems to go a bit farther -- he has an algorithm (a *curve-closing operator*) that actually takes an *open* curve and produces a closed curve that is nearby in the $C_1$ norm. He uses this to construct piecewise circular approximations that consist of circles of *equal* radii, along with some control over the $C^1$ distance between the original curve and the approximation.



We also talked a bit about another problem Jason was working on, discussed in the following papers:

- [The symplectic geometry of closed equilateral random walks in 3-space (Cantarella, Shonkwiler 2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5924)
- [A Fast Direct Sampling Algorithm for Equilateral Closed Polygons (Cantarella et al 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02466)

Dirichlet's Theorem: An arithmetic progress with $(a, p) = 1$ contains infinitely many primes.

### Non-split Extensions

[Reference](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1082283/example-of-a-non-splitting-exact-sequence-0-%E2%86%92-m-%E2%86%92-m-oplus-n-%E2%86%92-n-%E2%86%92-0/1082313#1082313) Not every sequence of the form $0\to A \to A \oplus C \to C \to 0$ splits; take
$$
0 \to \ZZ \to \ZZ \oplus \bigoplus_\NN \ZZ/(2) \to \bigoplus_\NN \ZZ/(2) \to 0
$$
where the first map is multiplication by 2, the second is the quotient map and a right-shift. This can't split because $(1, 0, \cdots)$ has order 2 in the RHS but pulls back to $(1, 0) \oplus (2\ZZ \oplus 0)$ which has no element of order 2.



### Cogroups

Reference: [One of Qiaochu Yuan's Blog Posts](https://qchu.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/structures-on-hom-sets/)

Cogroup objects: have structure maps
$$
m: H \to H^2 \\
e: H \to 0 \\
i: H \to H
$$
where $0$ is an initial object.

Example: $S^n \in \mathrm{hoTop}$.
Importance: What structure does $H$ need to have such that $\hom(H,\wait)$ has a group structure when applied? The answer is that $H$ is a group object in $\mathcal{C}\op$, or equivalently that $H$ is a cogroup object in $\mathcal{C}$.

The forgetful functor $U: \Set\to\Grp$ is representable by $\hom_{\Grp}(\ZZ, \wait)$, and the coproduct in $\Grp$ is the free product.

Recall that $\mathrm{CommRing}\op \cong \mathrm{AffSch}$, the category of affine schemes.

The adjoint to the forgetful functor $\mathrm{CommRing} \to \Set$ is the free commutative ring on $X$, i.e. $\ZZ[X]$, and is thus representable. The forgetful functor $\mathrm{CommRing} \to \Ab$ given by sending a ring to its underlying abelian group is also representable, namely by $\hom_{\Ring}(\ZZ[x], \wait)$. The coproduct in $\Ring$ is the tensor product over $\ZZ$, and the initial object is $\ZZ$.

$\ZZ[x]$ with its cogroup structure defines the structure of an affine group scheme on $\spec \ZZ[x]$, which represents the "additive group" functor and is called the additive group scheme $\GG_a$. Dualizing, an affine group scheme in the category $\mathrm{CommRing}$ is precisely a Hopf algebra.

Similarly, the forgetful functor $\mathrm{CommRing} \to \Ab$ given by sending $R$ to $R\units$ is representable by $\hom_{\Ring}(\ZZ[x, x\inv], \wait)$, and the corresponding affine group scheme $\spec \ZZ[x, \xinv]$ is the multiplicative group scheme $\GG_m$.

Note: the functor $\AffSch \to \Set$ sending a ring to its set of prime ideals is not representable (and doesn't preserve products), but the functor $\hom_{\AffSch}(\spec k, \wait)$ sending a scheme to its $k\dash$points for any $k$ is representable (and preserves all limits).

- One of Serre's tricks: use group quotients cleverly.

- There is a way to directly add/subtract/multiply Hodge diamonds.

- Inverse Hodge problem: when can a Hodge diamond be realized by a smooth projective variety?
  Very hard problem.
  Want to use this to get information about $h_{\crys}$.

- Easier question: look at linear/polynomial relations satisfied by all Hodge diamonds of $\Vark(\smooth, \proj)$?


- Main theorems: for a fixed dimension $n$,

  - Linear relations are spanned by Serre duality in positive characteristic.
  - In $\ch(k) > 0$, the only polynomial relations are $h^{0,0} = 1$ and Serre Duality.
  - In $\ch(k) = 0$, one has to add in Hodge symmetry.

- Important tools:
  - Kunneth formula for Hodge diamonds: there's a graphical way to do this by summing over several different ways to place blocks in the diamonds.
  - Blowups: \[
h(\Bl_2 X) 
  &= h(X) - h(z) + h(E) \\
  &= h(X) - h(z) + h(z)(1 + \LL + \LL^2 + \cdots + \LL^{c-1} )\\
  &= h(z) + (\LL + \LL^2 + \cdots + \LL^{c-1} )
  \]
  where $z$ is the point removed and $E$ is the exceptional divisor.

  - Produces an action on $H_\et( \mathcal{A}_{g, \CC}; \ZZ_p)$.

- Extracting $p$th roots? 
  Passing from $k[g_1, \cdots, g_n]$ to $k[g_1^{1/p}, \cdots, g_n^{1/p}]$, I think...

- F-pure and strongly F-regular singularities are characteristic $p$ analogs of log-canonical and log-terminal singularities in the minimal model program.

- Tilting: pass from mixed characteristic to characteristic $p$.

\[
\# \Sha(E/\QQ) \underset{?}{=} \qty{ L(E, 1) \over \Omega} \qty{ \#(E(\QQ))^2 \over \prod_\ell w_\ell}

  where \( \Omega \) is a period and \( w_\ell \) are the local Tamagawa numbers.

- Need lower bounds of sizes of class groups.
  Might be able to use elliptic curves, congruences between Eisenstein series and cusp forms on $\operatorname{U}(2, 2)$ -- can obtain 4-dimensional Galois representations that lead to nontrivial elements of $\Sha$.

## Notes from Eisenbud

An ideal $\mfp$ is prime iff $JK \subset \mfp \implies J \subset \mfp$ or $K\subset \mfp$.

A ring is a domain iff the ideal $(0)$ is prime.

> Inductively, if $\mfp$ contains a product of ideals then it contains one of them.

Maximal ideals are prime, since $\mm$ maximal implies that $R/\mm$ is a field.

A ring is *local* iff it has a unique maximal ideal $\mm$.

An element $e$ is idempotent iff $e^2 = e$.

An $R\dash$algebra $S$ is a ring $S$ and a homomorphism $\alpha:R \to S$.

Every ring is a $\ZZ\dash$algebra in a unique way.

The most interesting commutative algebras are $S/I$ where $S = k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ for $k$ a field, $\ZZ$, or the localization of a ring at a prime ideal.

- The representation ring $R(G)$: the free \(\ZZ\dash\)module on isomorphism classes of irreducible representations.

  - How can we construct this using modern groupoid yoga? 
  Take the category \( \modsleft{G} \), somehow restrict to just irreducibles.
  Maybe there's a better thing to do here though, like "ignoring" reducibles the same way John Carlson "ignored" projectives.
  But okay, anyway, take that category. 
  Take its nerve and then the geometric realization and then $\pi_0$ or something?
  And then take the free \(\ZZ\dash\)module.
  I definitely need to ask some homotopy theorists how this construction goes for usual \(K\dash\)theory in modern terms.
  So like...
  \[
  \ZZ \left[ \pi_0 \abs{ N \cat{C} } \right]
  .\]
  The $\pi_0$ should be taking isomorphism classes somehow, but maybe this only works for groupoids?
  But okay, whatever, I just need a functor that takes categories into spaces where two objects end up in the same path component iff they're isomorphic in $\cat{C}$. 
  So maybe this needs to be something more simplicial.

## What is a scheme?

- <https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201711/rnoti-p1300.pdf>

- Manifolds are the place to do differential calculus, schemes are the place to do algebra by finding zeros of functions.

- Closed points: of the form $V(S) \da \ts{ q\in \spec R \st q\contains S}$

- I really like the "keeping a problem list" idea.

- Don't be ashamed to ask people if they have problems you can work on.

## Group Cohomology in Homotopy Theory?

- Thinking about the link between group cohomology and homotopy theory: if I have a SES 
\[
0\to A \to B \to C \to 0
,\]
  should one apply a functor like $K(\wait, 1)$?
  Is this actually a functor...?
  We definitely get spaces $K(A, 1)$ and $K(B, 1)$, for example, and there must be an induced map between them.
  Want to make precise what it means to get a SES like this:
  \[
  0 \to K(A, 1) \to K(B, 1) \to K(C, 1) \to 0
  .\]
  One would kind of want this to be part of a fiber sequence I guess.
  But we're in $\Top$ anyway, so there's no real issue with just doing fibrant/cofibrant replacement,.

  Maybe the "right" think to do here is to actually take classifying groupoids (?), which must be some functor like $\B: \Grp \to \Grpd$.
  Surely this is some known thing.
  But then what is an "exact sequence of groupoids"...?
  \[
  0 \to \B A \to \B B \to \B C \to 0
  .\]

  Also, why should such a functor be an exact? 
  It'd kind of be more interesting if it *weren't*.
  Say it's right-exact, then how might you make sense of $\Ld \B(\wait)$?
  I think this just needs a model category structure on the *source*, although it seems reasonable to expect that $\Grpd$ would have some simple model structure.


## SeZoom

- Try computing things like $\Gal (\QQ( \zeta_3, \sqrt{3})$.

- There's some way to check orders of Galois groups using valuations..?

- See Néron-Ogg-Shafarevich criterion: good reduction iff inertia acts trivially, or semistable reduction iff inertia acts unipotently.
Always have quasi-unipotently, so eigenvalues roots of unity.
  - Easy to elliptic curves. 
  For AVs, requires Néron models, see Silverman.

- Galois representations at different primes are related, using local info at a few primes to get global info at all primes.

## Derived Stacks 

- We can't prove the Tate conjecture?
  I guess this is an arithmetic analog of the Hodge conjecture. 
  Serre's book calls some isomorphism the Tate conjecture and says it's proved though.

- Pithy explanation of a derived scheme: a space which can be covered by Zariski opens $Y\cong \spec A^*$ where $A\in \cdga_{k}$.

  - Schemes and stacks can be very singular. 
  Derived schemes/stacks act a bit like smooth, nonsingular objects.
  Morphisms behave like they are transverse?

- Derived modular stacks of coherent sheaves over $X$ remember the entire deformation theory of sheaves on $X$.
  - The homology of its "tangent space" at a point $[E]$ is $\Ext^*(E, E)$, which only holds in restricted degrees if you only use a non-derived moduli scheme or stack.

Bhargav Bhatt (Harvard NT Seminar)

- One can take etale cohomology of varieties, and later refine to schemes, and thus take it for the base field even when it's not algebraically closed and extract arithmetically interesting information.

- Prismatic cohomology: meant to relate a number of other cohomology theories

- Prism: a pair $(A, I)$ where $A$ is a commutative ring with a derived Frobenius lift $\phi:A\to A$, i.e. a $\delta\dash$structure.
  - $I \normal A$ is an ideal defining a Cartier divisor.
  - $A$ is $(P, I)\dash$complete.
  - Any ideal generator $d\in I$ satisfies $\phi(d) = d^p + p\cdot u, u\in A\units$.

- Fix a scheme and study prisms over it.
  Need these definitions to have stability under base-change.

- Examples:
  - $A \da \ZZ_p$ and $\phi = \id$ with $I = \gens{ p }$ yields crystalline cohomology. 
  - $A \da \ZZ_p[[u]], \phi(u) = u^p$.
  Then $I = \gens{ E(u) }$ is generated by an Eisenstein polynomial. 
  Here $A/I = \OO_K$

- Prismatic site: fix a base prism $(A, I)$ for $X$ a \(p\dash \)adic formal scheme over $A/I$.
  Define
  \[
  (X/A)_\prism = \ts{ (A, I) \to (B, J) \in \Mor(\Prism), \Spf(B/J) \to X \text{ over } A/I } 
  ,\]
  topologized via the flat topology on $B/J$.

- There is a structure sheaf $\OO_\prism$ where $(B, J) \to B$.
  Take $\Rd \Gamma$, which receives a Frobenius action, to define a cohomology theory.
  Why is this a good idea?

- Absolute prismatic sites: for $X\in \Sch(\padic)$, define
\[
X_\prism \da \ts{ (B, J) \in \Prism,\, \Spf(B/J) \to X } 
.\]
  Take sheaf cohomology to obtain $\Rd\Gamma_\prism(X) \da \Rd \Gamma(X_\prism, \OO_\prism) \selfmap_\phi$.

- The category $\Prism$ doesn't have a final object, so has interesting cohomology.
Relates to algebraic $K\dash$theory of $\ZZ_p$?

- Questions: let $X_{/\ZZ_p}$ be a smooth formal scheme.
  -  What is the cohomological dimension of $\Rd \Gamma_\prism(X)$?
  - What are the $F\dash$crystals on $X_\prism$?
    - Produce finite flat $B\dash$modules?

- Bhatt and Lurie: found a stacky way to understand the absolute prismatic site of $\ZZ_p$.
  Drinfeld found independently.

- Construction due to Simpson: take $X\in \Var(\Alg)$, define a de Rham presheaf
\[
X_{\dR}: \CCalg^{\fp} &\to \Set \\
R &\mapsto X(R_\red)
.\]

  - Translates other cohomology theories into something about coherent sheaves..?
  - Can reduce to studying e.g. a vector bundle on a more complicated object.

- Def: Cartier-Witt stack, a.k.a. the prismatization of $\ZZ_p$
   - Define $\WCart$ to be the formal stack on $p\dash$complete rings.
- Plug in a $p\dash$nilpotent ring $R$ to extract all (derived) prism structure on $W(R)$.
- Prisms aren't base-change compatible without the derived part.
- This is a groupoid.

- An explicit presentation: $\WCart_0(R)$ are distinguished Witt vectors in $W(R)$.
  Given by \( [a_0, a_1, \cdots ] \) where $a_0$ is nilpotent and $a_1$ is a unit.
  This is a formal affine scheme.
  $\WCart = \WCart_0 / W^*$ is a presentation as a stack quotient.

  - Receives a natural Frobenius action, which is a derived Frobenius lift.

- Start by understanding its points, suffices to evaluate on fields of characteristic $p$.

- If $k\in \Field(\Perf)_{\chp}$, $\WCart(k) = \ts{ \pt }$, with the point represented by $(W(k), ?)$.

  - Yields a (geometric?) point $x_{\FFp}: \spec(\FFp) \to \WCart$.

- Analogy to understanding Hodge-Tate cohomology.
  Similar easy locus in this stack.

- Take 0th component of distinguished Witt vectors to get a diagram

\begin{tikzcd}
  \WCart &&& {\hat{\AA^1}/\GG_m} \\
  \\
  \\
  {\WCart^{\mathrm{HT}}} &&& {B\GG_m}
  \arrow[dashed, from=4-1, to=4-4]
  \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-4]
  \arrow[hook, from=4-4, to=1-4]

- The bottom-left is this *Hodge-Tate stack*.

- Now has a better chance of being an algebraic stack instead of a formal stack.
  Bottom arrow kills the formal direction.

- Will be classifying stack of a group scheme: need to produce a point and take automorphisms.

- Take the distinguished element $V(?) \in W(\ZZ_p)$.
Produces a map
\[
\Spf(\ZZ_p) \mapsvia{\pi_\HT} \WCart^\HT
.\]

  - Fact: $\pi_\HT$ is a flat cover and $\Aut(\pi_\HT) = W^*[ F]$.

- **Upshot**: $\WCart^\HT = \B W^* [F]$ is a classifying stack.
  Quasicoherent sheaves on the left and representations of the (classifying stack of the) group scheme on the right. I.e. $\D_\qc(\WCart^\HT) = \Rd (W^*[F])$.
  - Teichmüller lift yields a $\ZZ/p$ grading on the LHS.

  - Something about Deligne-Illusie?
  Hodge-to-deRham degeneration?
  - Upshot: a divisor inside is easy to understand.

- Fact: $\D_\qc(\WCart)$ are equivalent to 
\[
\inverselim_{(A, I)\in \Prism} \D_{(P, I)-?}(A)
.\]

- Diffracted Hodge cohomology: let $X\in \Schf_{\ZZ_p}$.
  Get a prismatic structure sheaf using the assignment $(A, I) \to \Rd \Gamma_\prism \qty{ (X\tensor A/I) / A}$.

- Heuristic: $\spec \ZZ_p$ should be 1-dimensional over something.

- Get an absolute comparison: $\cohdim \Rd \Gamma_\prism (X) \leq d+1$ where $d = \reldim X_{/\ZZ_p}$.

- There is a deRham comparison: 
\[
X_{\FFp}^* H_\prism(X) \cong \Rd \Gamma_\dR (X_{\FFp})
.\]

- There is a Hodge-Tate comparison: the object $H_\prism(X)$ restricted to $\WCart^\HT$ has an increasing filtration with $\gr_i = \Rd \Gamma(X, \Omega^i_X)[-i]$.

  - Use representation interpretation, then $\mu_p \actson \gr_i$ by weight $-i$.

- Combine these comparisons to get Deligne-Illusie: if $\reldim X < p$, then 
\[
\Rd \Gamma_\dR(X_{\FFp}) \cong \bigoplus_{i} \Rd \Gamma(X_{\FFp}, \Omega^i[-i])
.\]
Get a lift to characteristic zero, yields Hodge-to-deRham degeneration there.

- An $F\dash$crystal on $X_\prism$ is a vector bundle $\bundle{E} \in \Vect(X_\prism, \OO_\prism)$? 
  Plus some extra data.

- Infinite tensor product:
\[
I_\prism \tensor F^* I_\prism \tensor (F^2)^* I_\prism \tensor \cdots 
.\]
  Converges to some object \( \OO_\prism \ts{ 1 } \in \Pic(X_\prism, \OO_\prism ) \), twisted?
  Yields isomorphism of sheaves after inverting $I_\prism$,
   \[
   F^* \OO_\prism \ts{ 1 } \cong I_\prism\inv \tensor \OO_\prism \ts{ 1 } 
   .\]

   - Convergence: this is a formal stack, any thickenings are identified with something...
   On each finite approximation, most terms are $\OO_X$.

- Some analog of Artin–Schreier here, taking fixed points?

- There is a natural functor from $F\dash$crystals on $X$ to local $\ZZ_p$ systems on a geometric fiber $X_?$?

- Main theorem: produces descent data, uses work on Beilinson fiber sequence (Benjamin Antieau, Morrow, others?)

- Can say
\[
H^i(\Delta_{\ZZ_p}) =
\begin{cases}
\ZZ_p & i=0 
\\
\prod_{\NN} \ZZ_p & i=1.
\end{cases}
\]
  Can compute using THH?
  $\pi_{-1}( \TP(\ZZ_p) )$ is where the $i=1$ part comes from.

  - TP corresponds to prismatic cohomology, THH corresponds to Hodge-Tate cohomology.

- Prismatic is filtered by things that look like Hodge-Tate

- Absolute = arithmetic (take eigenspaces, related to motivic cohomology), relative = geometric?

  - Link to $K\dash$theory comes from eigenspaces somehow.

- Similar to situation in étale cohomology: need absolute and relative to compute either.

## Why are triangulated and derived categories important?

- Homological algebra lives in the derived category
- In AG, tight link between birational equivalence (of say smooth projective varieties) and equivalence of $\DCoh$, the derived categories of coherent sheaves
- See the Bondal-Orlov conjecture.
  - Birationality is a weakening of isomorphism between varieties
  - Being derived equivalent is a weakening of having equivalent $\DCoh$
  - Both recover actual isomorphisms in the case of smooth projective varieties
- Rep theory: equivalent derived categories is called *Morita equivalence*.
  - Derived equivalence is a weakening of Morita equivalence
  - Can replace an algebra by a much simpler derived-equivalent one
  - Use to study blocks of group algebras
  - Lots of numerical consequences?

### The Relationship Between THH and K-Theory

> Some remarks on $\THoH$ and $K\dash$Theory, no clue what the original source was:

- Algebraic \(K\dash\)theory  is hard, using $\THoH$ somehow makes computations easier.
- \(K\dash\)theory says something about vector bundles, $\THoH$ describes monodromy of vector bundles around infinitesimal loops
- For $X$ a nice scheme, take $LX$ the derived free loop space: the derived mapping stack $\Map_\DSt(S^1, X)$.
  - Points of $LX$: infinitesimal loops in $X$
- Identify $\THoH(X) \mapsvia{\sim} \OO(LX)$ (global functions)
  - Corollary of a result in Ben-Zvi--Francis--Nadler "Integral Transforms and Drinfeld Centers in Derived Algebraic Geometry"?
- Dennis trace: a comparison $K(X) \THoH(X)$, takes $E\in \VectBundle$ to the canonical monodromy automorphism of the pullback of $E$ to $LX$
  - Use the map $LX\to X$ sending a loop to its basepoint
- Traces are $S^1$ equivariant because loops!
  Just equip $K(X)$ with the trivial $S^1$ action

- Take homotopy fixed points to get something smaller than $\THoH$: $\THC^-$, topological negative cyclic homology
  - See Connes' negative cyclic homology

- Dennis trace is invariant under *all* covering maps of circles, even multisheeted
  - Encoded not in a group action by a *cyclotomic* structure.
  - Take homotopy fixed points of the cyclotomic structure on $\THoH$ to get $\TC$, topological cyclic homology
  - There is a map $K\to \TC$
- Theorem of Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy: whenever $A\to A'$ is a nilpotent extension of connective ring spectra, $K(A') \mapsvia{\sim} K(A) \fiberprod{\TC(A)} \TC(A')$

## Modular forms

- Modular forms can be defined as functions $\HH\to \CC$ satisfying weak $\Gamma\dash$invariance.
- Also sections of a bundle: the modular curve.
- Weights refer to growth rates of these functions
- A weight $k$ modular form is an element of $H^0(X; \omega^{\tensor k})$ where $X$ is the compactified modular curve, a quotient of $H \union \PP^1(\QQ)$
  - This definition extends to $H/\Gamma$

- Weird fact: $M_1$ is one-dimensional, but for $g\geq 2$ we have $\dim M_g = 3g-3$

  - Special things for $g=1$: $q \dash$expansions (i.e. Fourier seres), vanishing Torelli, $\pi_1 \TT$ for the torus is abelian, the $\theta$ function has a discrete zero locus, infinite product expansions like Jacobi's triple product

- Higher genus generalizations come not from a Teichmüller cover $T_g \surjects M_g$ or $M_g$, no one seems to care about those though.
  - People do care about Siegel modular forms: replace $\HH$ with $\HH_S^g$ the symmetric $g\times g$ matrices with positive-definite imaginary part

- $\HH_S^g/\Sp(2g; \ZZ)$ is somehow a model for PPAVs, $M_g$ embeds as a variety since we have Jacobians.

- Hodge bundle: rank $g$ over $M_g$, fibers over isomorphism classes are $H^0(X, K_X)$ where $K$ is the canonical, then take the determinant bundle.


  - Surprisingly, $\HH_S^g$ is a Lie group but not a Lie algebra: $[AB]^t = -[BA]^t$, so it's not closed.

## The "Three Things" Exercise

Reminding myself of Ravi's "Three Things" exercise. Quote:

Here is how it works. Take a clean sheet of paper, or an index card. Your goal is to have three things, and only three things, on this sheet at the end of the talk. The "things" can be of many forms:

- A **definition** you want to remember (e.g. "a K3 surface is...")
- A **theorem** you want to remember ("the moduli space of polarized K3 surfaces is smooth")
a motivating or key example ("a quartic is an example of a K3 surface")
- A **motivating problem** ("why are all moduli spaces of polarized K3 surfaces the same dimension?")
- A **question you want to ask the speaker** ("why is that hypothesis in your theorem?")
- A **question you want to ask someone else** (a definition, motivation, a question about a connection etc.)
- Anything else of a similar flavor: something specific that made you think. Something vague ("I liked the part where she talked about groups") does not count as a "thing".

As you watch the talk, look out for "things" you like. When one comes your way, write it down.

- What are the $\kappa$ classes?

- Question: when does $A^*(M_g) = R^*(M_g)$?

- The integral Chow ring is *very* unknown. We know it only very recently for $M_2, \bar{M_2}$. Compare to rational Chow rings: we know them as quotients of polynomial rings for $M_g, g\leq 23$.

- Can stratify $M_g$ by gonality.

- What are hyperelliptic curves?

- Beilinson-Bloch conjecture: generalizes the BSD conjecture.
- What are higher [Chow groups](../zettelkasten/Chow%20Ring.md) ?
  What do they generalize?
  - Higher Chow groups: generalize the [[Mordell-Weil group]] for [elliptic curves](../zettelkasten/Elliptic%20curve.md)

- What is an [[../zettelkasten/adele]]? What is an [adelic](../zettelkasten/adele.md) point?

- I should also review what a [[../zettelkasten/place]] really is.
  Definitely what it means to be an Archimedean place.
  Also double-check the $v\divides \infty$ notation.

- What is an [[automorphic representation]]?

- See Gross-Zagier formula.

- What is a modular curve? What is a Heegner divisor for some imaginary quadratic field over $\QQ$ and why can one use the theory of CM to get it defined over other fields?

- Gotta learn [modular forms](../zettelkasten/modular%20form.md).
  They can take values in the complexification of a Mordell-Weil group?
  Also need to know something about Hecke operators.

- What is a [[Shimura variety]]?

- What is a theta series?
  Something here called an *arithmetic theta lift*, where some pairing form generalizes Gross-Zagier (?).
  See Beilinson-Bloch height maybe?

- I should read a lot more about Chow groups.

- What is Betti cohomology?

- Why is proving that something is modular a *big deal*?

- Look for the Kudla Program in arithmetic geometry, and Kudla-Rapoport conjecture.

- BSD was first checked numerically for CM elliptic curves! (Comment by Peter Sarnak)

![image_2021-04-15-17-20-37](figures/image_2021-04-15-17-20-37.png)

- What is the characteristic function of a lattice?
  What is a self-dual lattice?

![Analogies between BSD and BB](figures/image_2021-04-15-17-21-23.png)

- What is a Siegel Eisenstein series?
  Or even just an Eisenstein series.

- See Néron-Tate height pairing?
  Seems like these BB heights can only really be computed locally, then you have to sum over places.

- What are the Standard Conjectures?
  
- Main formula and big theorem:

  ![image_2021-04-15-17-35-06](figures/image_2021-04-15-17-35-06.png)

  Seems that we know a lot about the LHS, the right-hand side is new.
  We don't know nondegeneracy of the RHS, for example, e.g. the pairing vanishing implying the cycle is zero.

  - Proof technique: "doubling".

- See Tate conjecture.

- Comment from Peter Sarnak: we know very little about where $L$ functions vanish, except for $1/2$.

- Need to do resolution of singularities when you don't have a "regular" (integral?) model.

## 20:13

- Paper recommended by Juliette Bruce:
  <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02494.pdf>

  - Jonathan Love! 
  Shows some cool consequences of the BB conjecture, primarily a 2-parameter family of elliptic curves  where the image $\CH^1(E_1)_0 \tensor \CH^1(E_2)_0 \to \CH^2(E_1 \cross E_2)$ is finite.
  BB predicts this is always finite when defined over $k$ a number field.

- I should remind myself what local and global fields are.

  What does it predict for $L\dash$functions?
  - How does it relate to motivic cohomology?
- What are the BSD conjectures?
  What do they predict for $L\dash$functions?
- What is a regulator?

## Chat with Phil

- Some motivation for K3s: Fermat hypersurfaces $\sum x_i ^k$ for some fixed $k$.   
  Look for $\QQ\dash$points, since by homogeneity the denominators can be scaled out to get $\ZZ\dash$points

- Falting's theorem: for a curve $C$ with $g(C) \geq 2$, the number of rational points is finite, i.e. $\# C(\QQ) < \infty$.

  - Interesting consequence: there are only finitely many counterexamples to Fermat for any fixed $k$.
  In fact, there are zero, but still.

- Diagonal hypersurfaces $x_0^k + \cdots + x_n^k = 0$.    
  Calabi-Yau when $k=n+1$ (maybe a bound instead..?), sharp change in behavior of finiteness of rational points at this threshold.

## 15:23: Topology Talk

- Dehn Surgery: remove a tubular neighborhood of a knot, i.e. a solid torus, glue back in by some diffeomorphism of the boundary.

- $L\dash$spaces: simplest Heegard-Floer homology, rank of $\HF$ equals cardinality of $H_\sing$.

- Left-orderability on groups: a total order compatible with the group operation.
  Torsion groups can't be LO: $x>1 \implies 1 = x^n > \cdots > x > 1$.

  - Taut foliations: a geometric condition. Admits a decomposition into leaves where a simple closed curve intersects each transversally?

- Fibred 3-manifolds: take $\Sigma \cross I$ for $\Sigma$ a surface, glue the top and bottom by some diffeomorphism $\phi: \Sigma: \selfmap$.

- Osvath-Szabo: admitting a taut foliation implies being a non-$L\dash$space.
  Is the converse true?

- Interesting knot invariants: $\tau, s, g_4(K), \sigma$.
  Also the Jones, Conway, Alexander polynomials, or even just a coefficient.
  Note that some of these polynomials can not admit cabling formulas.

Note from Pete: a common technique on qual Algebra problems is extracting an index 2 subgroup using the Cayley action of $G$ on itself. These are always normal, so if this exists, $G$ can't be simply unless it's order 2.

> The connections between FGLs and homotopy are key. Read Quillen's paper, J.F. Adams' blue book, Ravenel, etc. Ravenel has some slides on Quillen's work (good entry pt). If you really want to go in depth, I enjoyed learning from Hazewinkel's book "Formal Groups and Applications".

## 16:30

### Setting Goals

- Don't set goals to be outcome-dependent.
  Set input goals!
  E.g. "Write a book that I'm proud of and I like."

- Don't set goals that depend on factors outside of your control -- hitting some metric, getting a specific award, etc.

- Check in with your emotional state.
  It's not always healthy to push through not feeling like doing something.
  This can be useful if it's a matter of discipline, i.e. if pushing through is actually serving you well.
  But it can also serve you poorly in the long run by exacerbating poor mental state or leading to burnout.

- It's okay to take a break.
  Check in to ask yourself if it's coming from a place of self-care or instead procrastination.

- Choose to be satisfied!
  The story you tell yourself after the fact does not change the reality of the past.
  Does it serve you well to say "I didn't do enough?"
  It's okay to choose to be satisfied.

### Studying

- Have a mental model is the key priority, then go to rote memorization only when absolutely necessary.
  Remember because you understand the subject!

- Use active recall for the *learning* process -- actively test yourself **as** you're reading.

- See book: "Make It Stick"

- The evidence is that popular techniques have low utility: rereading, highlighting, summarizing, taking notes.

- Summarizing and taking notes: low utility in general.
  This has some marginal utility if you're particularly skilled or trained in summarizing effectively.
  So not very effective, but do it if it brings you joy!

- Active recall and practice testing: high utility!
  Not very time-intensive, doesn't require special skills/training.

- Do practice testing **during each study session**.
  Studies show 10-15% improvement.
  Try to ask yourself inference questions.

- Studies show that those doing retrieval practice actually predict the smallest improvements and achieve the highest improvements.
  Very counterintuitive, trust the process!
  
- Reading once and practice testing can be more effective than rereading 4 times, *and* takes less time.

- Make first draft of notes with the book closed, no references.

- Spaced repetition: also works on a micro scale!
  E.g. within a single study session.

  - Recalling within a single session leads to almost a 30% increase in retention.
    Multiple successive recalls leads to no incremental gain, but multiple *spaced* recalls boosts by an additional 50%.
    Note that the last two are the same amount of work -- letting yourself forget slightly forces retrieval.

- Practice a little bit each day over a long period of time.

- Extremely important: scope your subject.
  Know the broad outline of the course inside and out.
  Can scope based on actual exams.

- Start from topics you *don't* know as well.
  E.g. work backwards though lecture notes.

- Try interleaved practice: don't necessarily need to master a topic before moving on, realizing that you'll be reviewing it several times again before it's needed.

  - Getting through a large number of topics can be more useful than getting through a single topic in detail.

- Idea for tracking system:
  put course outline by topics into a spreadsheet, then record dates of review next to each topic.
  Color code cells based on quality of recall.

- Revision needs to be a fluid process, not worth timetabling down to each section due to different time requirements for each.
  Pick what makes your brain work the hardest.

# Part 2: Surface bundles, mapping class groups, moduli spaces, and cohomology

> 29th Workshop in Geometric Topology, Oregon State University, June 29, 2012


- Talk about the theory surface bundles.
  - This talk: not so much related to his personal work!
  - Will revisit

Throughout: $\Sigma_g$ will be a connected oriented $g\geq 2$ surface, will look at $\Sigma_g\dash$ bundles given by
$$
\Sigma_g \to E \mapsvia{\pi} B
$$

(Fiber bundle where the base and total space will usually be compact manifolds, fiber is a surface)

For any $f\in \operatorname{Diff}(\Sigma_g)$, take cylinder on $\Sigma_g$ and glue ends via $f$ to obtain a 3-manifold and the surface bundle
$$
\Sigma_g \to M_f^3 \mapsvia{\pi} S^1
$$

Every 3-manifold that fibers over the circle is of this form! Why? Can remove a point from $S^1$ to get a trivial bundle.

Another way to build bundles: take a representation $\rho: \pi_1 B \to \operatorname{Diff}(\Sigma_g)$, let $$E = \tilde B \cross \Sigma_g / (x,y) \sim (g.x, \rho(g)(y))$$ (standard construction) where $\tilde B$ is the universal cover of $B$.

Generalizes previous example: take real line cross surface and mod out by deck transformations.

Such bundles are called flat $\Sigma_g$ bundles, exactly those which admit flat connections.

> Note on connections: there's a map $TE \mapsvia{\pi} TB$, can look at $\ker \pi$ which is a 2-plane bundle over $E$. 
> Take the kernel of $E \mapsvia{f} B$ is obtain a "vertical" 2-plane bundle, horizontal is not well-defined and so is a choice of a 2-plane field. 
> Flat means curvature vanishes is equivalent to Frobenius integrability theorem -- the 2-plane is integrable. 
> So curvature measures how integrable the 2-plane field is, rephrases "when is a 2-plane tangent to a foliation".

One organizing problem: classify surface bundles over a fixed closed base manifold up to

- Bundle isomorphism
  - Fiber-wise homeomorphism, but doesn't actually permute any fibers
  - Covering the identity map
- Homeomorphism
- Diffeomorphism
- Homotopy-equivalence
- Fiber-wise Homeomorphism
  - Homeomorphism that takes fiber to fiber
- Symplectomorphism
- Biholomorphism
  - Total spaces are complex manifolds

B.F. proved algorithmic computability for bundle isomorphisms, but homeomorphisms and even fiberwise homeomorphisms are generally unsolvable.

Why study $\Sigma_g$ bundles?

1. The simplest nonlinear bundle theory (i.e. structure group is not just $\GL(n)$, it is $S^1$)

2. For 3-manifolds: almost all (e.g. all hyperbolic) closed 3-manifolds are finitely covered by some $M_f^3$ surface bundle
  1. Famous conjecture of Thurston! Very recent.
    His fields medal was finding a single hyperbolic structure on a closed 3-manifold fibering over the circle.

3. For 4-manifolds: huge class of symplectic manifolds.
   1. Perpendicular to work of Mike Friedman, these fundamental groups all contain free groups.
   2. Donaldson: All closed symplectic 4-manifolds are Lefschetz fibrations (!!)

4. AG: $\mathcal M$ moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, decompose problems about varieties to problems about families of algebraic curves (i.e. what we call surface bundles)

The main invariant for these bundles: **The Monodromy Representation**

Let $\operatorname{Mod}(\Sigma_g)$ be the mapping class group of the surface, i.e. $\pi_0(\operatorname{Diff}^+ \Sigma_g)$) (group of homotopy/isotopy classes of diffeos on the surface).

Representation from earlier can be projected:
$$
\pi_1 B \to \operatorname{Diff}^+ \Sigma_g \mapsvia{\pi} \operatorname{Mod}(\Sigma_g)
$$

Take a homeomorphism to its homotopy class, Mod is finitely generated.

> In AG, the mapping class group is the orbifold fundamental group of $\mathcal{M}$, and this is a $K(\pi_1)$ space in the appropriate category.

So any bundle $\Sigma_g \to E \to B$ yields a corresponding monodromy representation
$$
\rho: \pi_1 B \to \operatorname{Mod} \Sigma_g
$$

Look at LES in homotopy, the map $\pi_2 B \to \pi_1 F$ has image in the center, but $\pi_a \Sigma_g$ is centerless, yielding a SES.

For any SES of groups, you can get a representation $\pi_1 B \to \operatorname{Out} \pi_1 F$

Can produce a map $\operatorname{Mod} \Sigma_g \to \operatorname{Out}\pi_1 \Sigma_g$ by applying a homeomorphism to $\pi_1$, might move the basepoint, but these are isomorphic groups (classical theorem).

Question: when does the representation lift?

\begin{tikzcd}
 &  & \operatorname{Diff}^+ \Sigma_g \arrow[dd] \\
 &  &  \\
\pi_1 B \arrow[rr] \arrow[rruu, "?" description, dotted] &  & \operatorname{Mod} \Sigma_g
\end{tikzcd}

Equivalently, is every bundle flat? 
No, but this is an open question when the base is a surface (i.e. for all we know, every representation could lift). 
Conjectured that for the Kodaira manifold, it is not flat. 
Big problem, because this is perhaps the simplest nonlinear connection.

## Monodromy as a Complete Invariant

Classifying space theory: there exists a (crazy) space $\operatorname{BDiff}^+\Sigma_g$ such that
$$
\theset{\text{iso classes } \Sigma_g \to E \to B} \iff [B, \operatorname{BDiff}^+ \Sigma_g]
$$

Model: general construction, just find any contractible space on which $\operatorname{Diff}$ acts freely and take the quotient. One that works: $\operatorname{Emb}(\Sigma_g, \RR^\infty)$.

Not useful yet, because we don't know what $\operatorname{BDiff}$ is.

Some serious math, theorem of Eels-Earle 1969:

- For surfaces $g\geq 2$, $\operatorname{Diff}_0(\Sigma_g)$ (the diffeos isotopic to the identity) is homotopy-equivalent to a point!
    - Note: can write mapping class group as Diff mod the path-component of the identity (i.e. it's the group of path components)
    - Uses Beltrami equation, measurable Riemann mapping theorem, solving PDEs, some serious Math!
    - $\operatorname{Diff}_0$ acts on the space of complex structures on the surface, and the quotient is Teichmuller space(?), which is contractible, which makes the space of complex structures contractible (from the LES in homotopy). This is some solution space of some PDE.

**Corollary**: we care about $\operatorname{Bdiff}$, classifying space theory doesn't really see contractible stuff. So:
$$
\operatorname{Bdiff}^+ \Sigma_g \simeq \operatorname{BMod}\Sigma_g = K(\operatorname{Mod}\Sigma_g, 1)
$$

Note that the last equality follows because there's no topology on the mapping class group of a discrete group.

**Huge conclusion**:

$$
\theset{\text{iso classes of } \Sigma_g\dash\text{bundles over } B} \iff
\theset{\text{conjugacy classes of representations } \rho: \pi_b \to \operatorname{Mod}\Sigma_g}
$$

Why? For any $X = K(\pi, 1)$ space, $[\wait, X] \cong$ the conjugacy classes of $[\pi_1 \wait, \pi_1 X]$(?)

Somehow, this all comes down to uniformization.

> Note: Reduces problem of classification up to bundle isomorphism (solved in general by B.F.) to a group theory problem immediately.

How are you given the bundle? Can be given as triangulation, in which case one can produce the monodromy map (huge number of steps though! $e^{e^{e^{\cdots}}}$). Or can be given the monodromy map; this determines the bundle.

**Theorem**: The conjugacy problem in $\operatorname{Mod} \Sigma_g$ is solvable.

But this does not solve the problem for homeo $\Sigma_g \to M^3 \to S_1$.

Why? Relates back to a paper of Thurston's, theory of the Thurston Norm, from paper "A norm on the Homology of 3-manifolds": there exist many 3-manifolds fibering over the circle (as long as $\beta_1(M^3) > 2)$ such that $M^3$ fibers $\Sigma_h \to M^3 \to S^1$ for infinitely many $h$, but finitely many for any fixed $h$.

How do you get an invariant out of this? 
Given two 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle, each with a monodromy in the mapping class group.
Are they conjugate in the mapping class group? 
If so, then the manifolds are the same. 
If not, the bundles are not isomorphic, *but* they could be homeomorphic in some accidental different way.

How to solve: the Thurston norm is computable. Need to enumerate all the ways of fibering, and find the minimal genus fibering. 
(Should be the same!) 
Check how many ways there are of fibering. 
Then check, for each fibering, are the monodromies the same? 
At least one needs to be the same to be homeomorphic.

## Characteristic Classes

For suitably nice spaces, given by a mapping
$$
\Sigma_g \to E \mapsvia{\pi} B \iff c(E \mapsvia{\pi} B) \in H^i(B)
$$

that is natural with respect to pullbacks; i.e. take

\begin{tikzcd}
E' \arrow[rr, "\tilde f"] \arrow[dd, "\pi'"] &  & E \arrow[dd, "\pi"] \\
 &  &  \\
B' \arrow[rr, "f" description] &  & B
\end{tikzcd}

and require that
$$
\tilde {f^*}(c(E \mapsvia{\pi} B) = c(\tilde {f^*}(E \mapsvia{\pi} B)).
$$

Any characteristic class is just an element of $H^*(\operatorname{BDiff}^+ \Sigma_g) = H^*(\operatorname{Mod} \Sigma_g)$, since every bundle will be a pullback of the universal bundle.

Lots of papers about the "stable cohomology" of the mapping class group, given by taking $g$ big enough. We know $\chi$ of the mapping class group, it grows superexponentially and we know polynomially-many. No known unstable classes in genus 5 or higher!!

What do we know?

- $H^1(\operatorname{Mod} \Sigma_g; \QQ) = 0$
- Elements of $H^2(\operatorname{Mod} \Sigma_g; \QQ)$: some known cocycles.

## The "Signature Cocycle"

Any 2-cycle (for any space) will be homologous to the image of a map $f$ of a surface into that space. Given blah, pullback the bundle over $\operatorname{BDiff}$:

\begin{tikzcd}
 &  & \Sigma_g \arrow[rr] &  & T \arrow[dd] \\
 &  &  &  &  \\
\Sigma_g \arrow[rr] \arrow[rruu, dotted] &  & M^4 \arrow[dd] \arrow[rruu, dotted] &  & \operatorname{BDiff}^+ \Sigma_g \\
 &  &  &  &  \\
 &  & \Sigma_h \arrow[rruu, "f" description] &  &
\end{tikzcd}

Take the signature of $M_4$ (where you use the intersection pairing on $H_2$, take the signature of that form). Using Novikov additivity for signature, this satisfies the cocycle condition and finally yields a number!

## Another Cocycle

Look at the vertical bundle over $T$, you get $\RR^2 \to E \to T$.

> Note: can see this bundle by looking at moduli space of Riemann surfaces $\mathcal{M}_g$, covered by $\mathcal{M}_g^*$ with fiber $\Sigma_g$. There is a vertical bundle over this, everything that is tangent to the fiber, which is a 2-plane bundle over the covering space.

So look at the Euler class $e\in H^2(T)$, take so-called "MMM class". How to get a cocycle? Can try integrating over fiber, so
$$
e_i = \int_{\Sigma_g} e^{i+1} \in H^{2i}(\operatorname{Mod} \Sigma_g; \QQ).
$$

> Note: the moduli space is a Kahler manifold, so you get the Weil-Peterson 2-form which is the Kahler class in $H^2$.

**Theorem (Harrer, 1980s):**
$H^2(\operatorname{Mod}(\Sigma)g; \RR) = \RR$, which is one-dimensional! 
So all of these classes are scalar multiples of each other - and in fact, sometimes not rational multiples, so sometimes you get interesting number-theoretic quantities like $\frac {\pi^2} 6$.

See book with Dan Margalit: all of this lives in the group $\operatorname{Mod} \Sigma_g \injects \operatorname{Homeo}^+(S^1)$

# Outline
Recommended approach: 3,4,9,10,11.

1. ?
2. Regularity
3. Transversality
	(Recommended)
4. Compactification and Bubbling
5. More bubbling
	Only look at 5.1 and 5.2.
	Main results are 5.2.1, 5.3.1, skip the rest
1. ?
2. Defining $\GW_{\mathrm{A}_k}^M$?
	See 7.1, add marked points in 7.3.
	Needed to understand applications in chapter 9.
8.

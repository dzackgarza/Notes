\hypertarget{formulae}{%
\section{Formulae}\label{formulae}}

Note that the theory is important for Combinatorics -- knowing what
definitions are and what various expressions count -- but it is a very
problem-driven subject. It is worth delineating exactly what kinds of
problems are tractable, and which are more difficult and require more
subtle methods. However, the ultimate skill in this course is to know
\emph{when} to apply which tool to a given problem, how to translate
problems into things you know how to count, and how to seamlessly move
back and forth between various combinatorial interpretations.

Problems are the best practice!

\hypertarget{overview}{%
\subsection{Overview}\label{overview}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(\theset{a, b, c, \cdots} = \theset{b, c, a, \cdots} = \theset{c, b, a, \cdots} = \cdots\)
  is a \textbf{set}, a structure which contains some finite number of
  unique elements, and there is a-priori notion of ``order'' or an
  indexing operation (i.e.~there is no distinguished ``first'' element,
  etc).
\item
  If \(S\) is a set, then \(\# S\) denotes the \textbf{size} of the set,
  i.e.~a count of the number of elements contained in \(S\).
\item
  \([a, b, c] \neq [b, c, a]\) is an \textbf{ordered list} (also called
  a \(k\dash\)tuple), a structure of not-necessarily unique elements
  from some set in which there is a well-defined order/indexing
  operation.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For example, the second element of \([b,c,a]\) is \(c\), and the
    first element of \([3,1,2]\) is 3.
  \item
    Equivalently, this can be thought of as a \textbf{word} from some
    \textbf{alphabet} of symbols. In this case, we may write \([a,b,c]\)
    as \(abc\) instead.
  \item
    Rigorously, if \(A\) is the set of elements we're interested in, an
    ordered list is an element of the \(k\dash\)fold product set
    \(A \cross A \cross \cdots A = A^k\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\hypertarget{sets}{%
\subsection{Sets}\label{sets}}

For any given \(n\), there is essentially \textbf{one} set of size
\(n\), the set \([n] = \theset{1,2,\cdots n}\). It is a theorem that
every set admits a \emph{well-ordering}, and a consequence of this is
that any set \(S\) of countable size \(n\) admits a bijective map
\(S \to [n]\). So \(S \cong [n]\) in the category of Sets, ``up to
relabeling'' of elements.

But be careful! \([n]\) comes with its own labeling \textbf{and } its
own ordering \(1 \leq 2 \leq \cdots\), and so should perhaps be regarded
as an ordered list with unique elements instead. As a set, we can order
the elements any way and obtain the same set.

\hypertarget{the-symmetric-group}{%
\subsection{The Symmetric Group}\label{the-symmetric-group}}

\(S_n\) denotes the \textbf{symmetric group} on \(n\) elements; each
element of this group is a bijective function \([n]\to[n]\).
Combinatorialists really love this group, and it secretly shows up in
most counting problems.

A \textbf{permutation} \(\sigma\) is an element of \(S_n\), We can
specify a bijection by describing where it sends every element, so for
example, define \[\begin{aligned}
\sigma: [5] &\to [5] &\\ \\
\sigma(1) &= 3 \implies &1 \mapsto 3 \\
\sigma(2) &= 4 \implies &2 \mapsto 4 \\
\sigma(3) &= 5 \implies &3 \mapsto 5 \\
\sigma(4) &= 2 \implies &4 \mapsto 2 \\
\sigma(5) &= 1 \implies &5 \mapsto 1 \\
\end{aligned}\] There are several more concise notations equivalent to
the above specification:

\hypertarget{two-line-notation}{%
\subsubsection{Two line notation}\label{two-line-notation}}

Write \(1\cdots n\), and under each number, write where it is sent to
under \(\sigma\): \[
\left( \begin{array}{ccccc}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
3 & 4 & 5 & 2 & 1
\end{array}\right)
\] In general, we write \[
\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 2 & \cdots & n  \\
\sigma(1) & \sigma(2) & \cdots & \sigma(n)
\end{array}\right)
\]

\hypertarget{one-line-notation}{%
\subsubsection{One line notation}\label{one-line-notation}}

Noting that in the above notation, we'll always write \(1\cdots n\) in
the top row, we can just omit it and implicitly agree that the
\(k\dash\)th position denotes where the integer \(k\) is mapped to: \[
[3,4,5,2,1] = 34521
\]

In general, we write a concatenated list of numbers \[
\sigma(1)\sigma(2) \cdots \sigma(n)
\]

\hypertarget{cycle-notation}{%
\subsubsection{Cycle Notation}\label{cycle-notation}}

Since \(S_n\) is a finite group, we know that every element will have
finite order. So for some given number \(i\), we can look at the
iterates
\(\sigma(i), \sigma^2(i) = \sigma(\sigma(i)), \sigma^3(i), \cdots\) and
there will be some \(k\) for which \(\sigma^k(i) = i\). This sequence of
images is called a \textbf{cycle}, and it turns out that we can recover
our permutation entirely from exhaustively recording the cycles.

The algorithm: start with \(1\), then compute all \(\sigma^i(1)\). Write
the resulting numbers in parentheses, then take the smallest number you
haven't seen yet, open a new parenthesis, and repeat until all numbers
\(1 \cdots n\) appear somewhere. Finally, if any set of parentheses
contains only a single number (so \(\sigma(i) = i\) after only 1
iteration), omit it.

Our example: \[
(1,3,5)(2,4)
\] which reads as ``1 maps to 3, 3 maps to 5, 5 maps to 1'' and ``2 maps
to 4, 4 maps to 2''.

In general, we write \[
(1, \sigma(1), \sigma^2(1), \cdots, \sigma^{k}(1))~(a_1, \sigma(a_1), \sigma^2(a_1), \cdots, \sigma^{k_1}(a_1)) ~ \cdots
\]

Observations/notes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  While \((abc) \neq (bac)\) as cycles, we do have
  \((abc) = (cab) = (bca) = (abc)\). So order matters \emph{somewhat},
  but not every reordering yields a new distinct cycle. Instead, for a
  cycle \(\sigma\) of length \(k\), there are exactly \(k-1\)
  representatives that are equivalent to \(\sigma\) and only differ by
  these ``shifts''.
\item
  By writing things out this way, we've represented \(\sigma\) as a
  \textbf{product of disjoint cycles}, i.e.~no number occurs in more
  than one set of parentheses. Moreover, we can do this for every
  element \(\sigma\), so we say that \(S_n\).
\item
  It is sometimes useful to write these in a ``canonical'' way -- shift
  every cycle so the largest elements are first, then sort the cycles in
  increasing order based on those first elements.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{useful-facts-about-the-symmetric-group}{%
\subsubsection{Useful facts about the Symmetric
group}\label{useful-facts-about-the-symmetric-group}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Every element can be written as a product of disjoint cycles
\item
  Disjoint cycles commute
\item
  The group-theoretic order of a cycle is its length
\item
  The group-theoretic order of a product of cycles is the least common
  multiple of the lengths.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{permutations}{%
\subsection{Permutations:}\label{permutations}}

We can count the number of bijections from an \(n\) element set to
itself: \[ \#\theset{\text{Permutations of} [n]} = \abs{S_n}  = n! \]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Also the number of a ways to form an \textbf{ordered list} of \(n\)
  unique elements (\(n\) choices for 1st element, \(n-1\) choices for
  2nd, etc).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{ordered-lists}{%
\subsection{Ordered Lists}\label{ordered-lists}}

If \(\#\Sigma = k\) is some set (which we'll regard as ``formal
symbols''), we can count the number of ordered lists: \[
\# \theset{\text{Length $k$ lists over $\Sigma$}} = n^k
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Logic: Suppose \(L = l_1 l_2, \cdots l_k\), then there are \(n\)
  choices of symbol for \(l_1\), \(n\) choices for \(l_2\), etc.
\item
  Also counts the number of words over an alphabet of size \(k\).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{falling-factorial}{%
\subsection{Falling Factorial}\label{falling-factorial}}

Let \[\begin{aligned}
n^{\underline k} &\definedas \prod_{i=0}^{k-1}(n - i) \\
&= n(n-1)\cdots (n-k+1) \\
&= \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
\end{aligned}\] be the \emph{falling factorial}, which is a product with
exactly \(n\) terms.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Counts the number of ways to form an \textbf{ordered list} of \(k\)
  items from an \(n\) element set (i.e.~there is a distinguished
  ``first'' pick, ``second'' pick, etc)
\item
  Also counts the number of injections \([k] \injects [n]\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{rising-factorial}{%
\subsection{Rising Factorial}\label{rising-factorial}}

Let \[\begin{aligned}
n^{\overline k} &\definedas \prod_{i=0}^{k-1}(n+i) \\ &=n(n+1) \cdots (n+k-1)
\\&= \frac{(n+k-1)!}{(n-1)!} \\ \\&= (n+k-1)^{\underline k}
\end{aligned}\] be the \emph{rising factorial}, which is a product with
exactly \(n\) terms.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Counts the number of ways to form an \textbf{ordered list} of \(k\)
  items from an \(n+k-1\) element set.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{combinationsbinomial-coefficients}{%
\subsection{Combinations/Binomial
Coefficients}\label{combinationsbinomial-coefficients}}

Counts the number of ways to form a \(k\dash\)element \textbf{subset} of
a set of \(n\) items: \[
\begin{aligned}
\#\theset{k\dash\text{element subsets of } [n]} = {n \choose k} &\definedas \frac{n!}{k!(n-k!)} \\
&= {n \choose n-k} \\ \\
&= \frac{n^{\underline k}}{k!}
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Note that order does \textbf{not} matter here; we identify any two
  sets that differ by a permutation

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In other words, first form an ordered list of \(k\) unique elements
    from \([n]\) in \(n^{\underline k}\) ways, then quotient out by the
    \(k!\) ways to reorder the list that yield the same set.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Alternatively, ways to pick \(k\) items from \([n]\) \textbf{without
  replacement}, then remove the labels.
\item
  Alternatively, the coefficient of \(x^k\) in the expansion of
  \((1+x)^n\), i.e. \[
  (1+x)^n = \sum_{k\geq 0} {n\choose k} x^k
  \] which can be generalized to \[
  (x+y)^n = \sum_{k\geq 0} {n\choose k} x^ky^{n-k}
  \]
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{generalized-binomial-coefficients}{%
\subsubsection{Generalized Binomial
Coefficients}\label{generalized-binomial-coefficients}}

We can extend the ``choose'' notation and thus the binomial formula to
rational powers by defining \[
{r \choose k} = \frac{1}{k!} \prod_{i=0}^{k-1} (r - i) = \frac{r(r-1)(r-2)\cdots(r-k+1)}{k!}\\
(x+y)^r = \sum_{k\geq 0} {r\choose k} x^ky^{n-k}
\]

Note that this allows us to expand things such as
\(\sqrt{x+y} = (x+y)^\frac{1}{2}\) in an infinite sum: \[
\sqrt { 1 + x } = 1 + \frac { 1 } { 2 } x - \frac { 1 } { 8 } x ^ { 2 } + \frac { 1 } { 16 } x ^ { 3 } - \frac { 5 } { 128 } x ^ { 4 } + \frac { 7 } { 256 } x ^ { 5 } - \cdots
\]

\hypertarget{multisets}{%
\subsection{Multisets}\label{multisets}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is a multiset? If \(S\) is a set, you can think of a multiset
  \(M\) as a word in the symbols \(s_i \in S\) where order doesn't
  matter.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Example: \(S = \theset{a,b,c}\) and
    \(M = \theset{a,a,a,b,b} = \theset{a,b,a,a,b} = \cdots\)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Alternatively, it is a collection of elements of \(S\), each with a
  multiplicity, so a subset of \(S \cross \NN\), where we define the
  size to be the sum of the multiplicities instead of (the usual) number
  of elements.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Example: As above, \(M = \theset{(a, 3), (b,2)}\). Note that
    although \(M\) has size 2 as a set, it has size \(3+2 = 5\) as a
    multiset.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

We can thus count the number of \(k\dash\)element multisets of an
\(n\dash\)element set: \[\begin{aligned}
\#\theset{\text{Multisets of $[n]$ of size $k$} } &= \multinomial{n\choose k} \\ &\definedas {{n+k-1}\choose k} \\ &= {{n+k-1}\choose n-1} \\ \\ &= \frac{n^{\overline k}}{k!}
\end{aligned}\]

\emph{Proof}: Multisets can be put in bijection with unrestricted stars
and bars arrangements, see next section. \(\qed\)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The number \(\multinomial{n\choose k}\) is denoted a
  \textbf{multinomial coefficient}.
\item
  Also counts the number of ways to select \(k\) items \textbf{with
  replacement} from a set of size \(n\).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{catalan-numbers}{%
\subsection{Catalan Numbers}\label{catalan-numbers}}

Consider the problem of counting the number of \(n\times n\) lattice
paths that don't go above the diagonal. Since every such path has to
have a ``first hitting time'' for the diagonal, we can enumerate these
using a recurrence relation. Let \(C_n\) be the number of such paths. If
the first hit occurs on the \(k\)th diagonal, then there were \(C_k\)
paths leading there and \(C_{n-k}\) paths to the top-right corner. This
yields \[
C_{n+1} = \sum_{i=0}^n C_i C_{n-i}
\] and using generating functions, it can be shown that \[
C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}{2n \choose n}
\]

\hypertarget{stars-and-bars}{%
\subsection{Stars and Bars}\label{stars-and-bars}}

A useful conceptual counting problem, as many other problems can be
encoded as some version of this. The idea is we have an alphabet
\(\Sigma = \theset{\star, \mid}\) (``star'' and ``bar''), and we'd like
to form certain words containing exactly \(n\) copies of \(\star\) and
\(k\) copies of \(\mid\).

There are two variants: we'll say a configuration of stars and bars is
\emph{strict} if a bar does not occur as the first or last symbol, and
there are no two adjacent bars.

\hypertarget{variant-1-strict}{%
\subsubsection{Variant 1: Strict}\label{variant-1-strict}}

This can be counted as \[
\#\theset{\text{strict configurations of $n$ stars and $k-1$ bars}} = {n-1 \choose k-1}
\]

\emph{Proof}: Lay out \(n\) stars, which have \(n-1\) gaps between them.
From these gaps, choose any \(k-1\) of them (without replacement) to
contain bars.\(\qed\)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Note that this partitions the \(n\) stars into \(k\) nonempty groups,
  so this counts the number of ways to separate \(n\) indistinguishable
  objects into \(k\) nonempty groups,
\item
  Alternatively, counts the number of compositions of \(n\) into \(k\)
  parts.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{variant-2-unrestricted}{%
\subsubsection{Variant 2: Unrestricted}\label{variant-2-unrestricted}}

With no restrictions of the configuration, we can count \[
\#\theset{\text{unrestricted configurations of $n$ stars and $k-1$ bars}} = {n+k-1 \choose k-1}
\]

\emph{Proof}: Since we just need to form an arbitrary word from \(n\)
stars and \(k-1\) bars, simply place \(n + (k-1)\) blanks, choose
\(k-1\) of them (without replacement) to be bars, and place stars
everywhere else.

\emph{Alternate proof}: Lay out \(n\) stars, then from the \(n-1\) gaps,
choose \(k-1\) gaps with replacement to contain bars. This can be done
in \(\multinomial{n-1 \choose k-1} = {n+k-1 \choose k-1}\) ways.
\(\qed\)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Note that this partitions \(n\) stars into \(k\) groups, some of which
  may be empty.
\item
  Alternatively, counts the number of weak compositions of \(n\) into
  \(k\) parts.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{stirling-numbers-of-the-first-kind}{%
\subsection{Stirling Numbers of the First
Kind}\label{stirling-numbers-of-the-first-kind}}

For a given \(n\), consider permutations \(\sigma \in S_n\). It can be
written as a product of disjoint cycles in cycle notation, so one can
ask how many permutations have exactly \(k\) disjoint cycles. In other
words, we have \[
\sigma = \overbrace{(a_1b_1\cdots)(a_2b_2\cdots)\cdots(a_kb_k\cdots)}^{k \text{ cycles}} \in S_n
\] in cycle notation, where we include cycles of length 1 (i.e.~fixed
points). We can thus count \[
\#\theset{\text{permutations of $[n]$ with exactly $k$ disjoint cycles}} \definedas c(n, k) = \stirlingfirst{n}{k}
\] the \textbf{unsigned Stirling number of the first kind}.

\begin{quote}
In other applications, there is a \textbf{signed Stirling number of the
first kind} which are related by \[
s(n, k) \definedas (-1)^{n-k}c(n, k), \quad \abs{s(n,k)} = c(n, k)
\] These yield the coefficients of \(x^n\) in the falling factorial
\(x^{\underline n} = x(x-1)\cdots(x-n+1)\).
\end{quote}

There isn't a particularly nice closed form expression for \(c(n, k)\),
so the main computational tool is the following recurrence relation they
satisfy: \[
\stirlingfirst n k = (n-1){\stirlingfirst {n-1} k} + \stirlingfirst{n-1}{k-1}
\] \emph{Proof:} Either \(n\) is a fixed point (i.e.~in a cycle by
itself) or it is not.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If \(n\) is a fixed point, we can delete the cycle \((n)\) from
  \(\sigma\) to obtain a permutation of \([n-1]\) with \(k-1\) cycles.
  Conversely, we can lift any permutation of \([n-1]\) with \(k-1\)
  cycles to a permutation of \([n]\) by just adding the cycle \((n)\),
  which can only be done in one way, yielding the second term
\item
  Otherwise, \(n\) appears in a cycle with other elements. We can delete
  it to obtain a permutation of \([n-1]\) which still has \(k\) cycles;
  conversely, given such a permutation, consider the operation of
  multiplying \(\sigma\) by the transposition \((n~i)\) where
  \(1\leq i\leq n-1\). This has the effect of inserting \(n\) into the
  cycle containing \(i\), and in fact puts it right before \(i\), i.e.
  \[
  (a_1 a_2 \cdots a_{k}~ i ~ a_{k+1} \cdots a_m)(n~i) =  (a_1 a_2 \cdots a_{k}~ n ~ i ~ a_{k+1} \cdots a_m).
  \] There are exactly \(n-1\) choices for \(i\), and each one yields a
  way to insert \(n\) into an existing cycle, yielding the first term.
  \(\qed\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{stirling-numbers-of-the-second-kind}{%
\subsection{Stirling Numbers of the Second
Kind}\label{stirling-numbers-of-the-second-kind}}

A \textbf{set partition of \([n]\) into \(k\) parts} is a collection
\(S_1, S_2, \cdots S_k\) where

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(S_i \subseteq [n]\) for each \(i\)
\item
  \(S_i \neq \emptyset\) for any \(i\),
\item
  \(S_i \intersect S_j = \emptyset\) for all pairs \(1 \leq i,j \leq k\)
  (so all of the \(S_i\) are disjoint), and
\item
  \([n] = S_1 \disjoint S_2 \disjoint \cdots \disjoint S_k\)
\end{itemize}

We can then count \[
\#\theset{\text{Set partitions of $[n]$ into $k$ parts}} \definedas S(n, k) = \stirling n k,
\] which is referred to as the Stirling number of the second kind.
Although there is a closed-form formula for it, it is not particulary
nice -- the primary method of computing it comes from a recurrence
relation it satisfies: \[
\stirling n k = k\stirling {n-1} {k} + \stirling{n-1}{k-1}
\]

\emph{Proof (with a valuable technique!)}: When forming a set partition
of \([n]\) into \(k\) parts, there are two disjoint cases: either \(n\)
is in a singleton set, or it is not.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If \(n\) a singleton, throw that part away. What remains is a
  partition of \(n-1\) into \(k-1\) parts. Conversely, given any
  partition of \(n-1\) into \(k-1\) parts, we can add the part
  \(\theset{n}\) to obtain a partition of \(n\) into \(k\) parts where
  \(n\) is a singleton. This yields the second term.
\item
  If it is not, \(n\) is some \(S_i\) with at least 1 other element.
  Letting \(S'_i = S_i - \theset{n} \neq \emptyset\) we get a partition
  of \(n-1\) into \(k\) parts. Conversely, given any partition of
  \(n-1\) into \(k\) parts, we can form a partition of \(n\) into \(k\)
  parts where \(n\) is not a singleton by adding \(n\) to any part. Note
  that there are \(k\) choices for which part to add \(n\) to, yielding
  the first term. \(\qed\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{compositions}{%
\subsection{Compositions}\label{compositions}}

In general, a composition is a way of writing \(n\) as a sum of positive
integers, i.e.~\(n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots\) where \(a_i \in \ZZ\). There
are infinitely many of these, so to count anything, we need to place
various restrictions:

\hypertarget{strong-compositions}{%
\subsubsection{Strong Compositions}\label{strong-compositions}}

A \textbf{composition of \(n\) into \(k\) parts} is an \textbf{ordered
list} \([a_1, a_2, \cdots a_k]\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^k a_i = n\) and
for each \(i\) we have \(0 < a_i \leq n\). (Note that we \textbf{do not}
allow any \(a_i\) to be zero now.)

These can be counted as \[
\mathrm{comp}(n, k) = \#\theset{\text{compositions of $n$ into $k$ parts}} \\
= \multinomial{n+1 \choose k-1} \\ = {n+k-1 \choose k}
\] where \(\multinomial{a \choose b}\) is the multinomial coefficient.
This follows from by a bijection with strict stars and bars
configurations. Note that distinct lists yields distinct compositions.

\hypertarget{weak-compositions}{%
\subsubsection{Weak Compositions}\label{weak-compositions}}

A \textbf{weak composition of \(n\) into \(k\) parts} is an
\textbf{ordered list} \([a_1, a_2, \cdots a_k]\) such that
\(\sum_{i=1}^k a_i = n\) and for each \(i\) we have
\(0 \leq a_i \leq n\). (Note that we allow some \(a_i\) to be zero.)

These can be counted as \[
\mathrm{comp}_W(n, k)  = \#\theset{\text{weak compositions of $n$ into $k$ parts}} \\
= {n-1 \choose n-k},
\] which follows from a bijection with unrestricted stars and bars
configurations. Note that distinct lists yields distinct compositions.

\hypertarget{integer-partitions}{%
\subsubsection{Integer Partitions}\label{integer-partitions}}

An \textbf{integer partition of \(n\) into \(k\) parts} is a strong
composition of \(n\) into \(k\) parts where we identify any compositions
that differ by a permutation of of parts. In other words, it is a
\textbf{set} of integers \([a_1, a_2, \cdots a_k]\) such that
\(\sum_{i=1}^k a_i = n\) and for each i, \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).

\emph{Example}: The strong compositions of 4 are

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{from}\NormalTok{ sage.}\BuiltInTok{all} \ImportTok{import} \OperatorTok{*}
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\BuiltInTok{sorted}\NormalTok{(}\BuiltInTok{list}\NormalTok{(Compositions(}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{)), key}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{len}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[[4], [1, 3], [2, 2], [3, 1], [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]]
\end{verbatim}

while the integer partitions are

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{from}\NormalTok{ sage.}\BuiltInTok{all} \ImportTok{import} \OperatorTok{*}
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\BuiltInTok{sorted}\NormalTok{(}\BuiltInTok{list}\NormalTok{(Partitions(}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{)), key}\OperatorTok{=}\BuiltInTok{len}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[[4], [3, 1], [2, 2], [2, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]]
\end{verbatim}

Note that \([3,1]\) and \([1,3]\) are distinct as compositions of 4 into
2 parts, but are identified as partitions of 4 into 2 parts.

These are generally difficult to count, but we can define
\[\begin{aligned}
\# \theset{\text{Integer partitions of $n$ into $k$ parts}} &\definedas p(n, k) \\
\# \theset{\text{Integer partitions of $n$ into any number of parts}} &\definedas p(n).
\end{aligned}\]

Integer partitions are in bijective correspondence with \textbf{Ferrer's
diagrams}, which provide many useful ways of extracting information via
diagram operations. The most important operation is
\textbf{conjugation}, which is flipping a diagram about its main
diagonal. This operation can be used to prove the following bijections
between types of integer partitions:

\[\begin{aligned}
\#\theset{\text{Exactly $k$ parts}} &= \#\theset{\text{Largest part $= k$}}\\
\#\theset{\text{Any number of parts, where every part is $\leq k$}} &= \#\theset{\text{At most $k$ parts}} \\
\#\theset{\text{Any number of distinct, odd parts}} &= \#\theset{\text{Self-conjugate partitions}}
\end{aligned}\]

Usually given or put in the form of
\(a_n = f(a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \cdots)\)

The secret sauce:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Declare your generating function
  \(A(x) = \displaystyle\sum_{n\geq 0} a_n x^n\)
\item
  Multiply the recurrence through by \(x^n\).
\item
  ``Integrate out'' by summing over all values of \(n\) for which the
  recurrence is valid.
\item
  Write everything you see in terms of \(A(x), A'(x)\), or other
  polynomials in \(x\).
\item
  Solve for \(A(x)\) to get some analytic function.
\item
  (Optional) Produce a closed-form formula for \(a_n\) by expanding the
  analytic function as a power series, or using \textbf{coefficient
  extraction}: \[
  a_n = \frac{1}{n!} \restrictionof{\dd{^n A(x)}{x^n}}{x=0}
  \]
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{sequences-sums-and-closed-forms}{%
\subsection{Sequences, Sums, and Closed
Forms}\label{sequences-sums-and-closed-forms}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A right shift is the operation
  \([a_0, a_1, a_2, \cdots] \mapsto [0, a_0, a_1, \cdots]\), so
  \(R(A(n)) = A(n-1)\)
\item
  A left shift is the operation
  \([a_0, a_1, a_2, \cdots] \mapsto [a_1, a_2, a_3 \cdots]\), so
  \(L(A(n)) = A(n+1)\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Note that this loses information! \(a_0\) disappears.
  \item
    Generally done by derivatives.

A \emph{linear ordered partition} of \([n]\) (say, into 2 blocks) is a
set partition \[[n] = S_1 \disjoint S_2\] where
\[x\in S_1 \implies \forall y\in S_2, x \leq y.\] In other words,
\(S_1 = [1, 2, \cdots, m]\) and \(S_2 = [m+1, m+2, \cdots, n]\). The
\emph{linear} part denotes the inequality, while the \emph{ordered} part
denotes the fact that we are labeling the \(S_i\) with ordered numbers,
choosing which \(S_i\) to call ``1'', ``2'', and so on.

An \emph{arbitrary ordered partition} of \([n]\) (again into 2 parts) is
a set partition as above, where we no longer require the inequality. The
\emph{ordered} portion again denotes the labels on the \(S_i\), so we
have \([S_1, S_2] \neq [S_2, S_1]\) and distinguish these as ordered
partitions.

  \item
    Using the product rule, we obtain \[
    A(x) = (1 +x + \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{3!}x^3)(x + \frac{1}{2!}x^3)\cosh(x) = ?

    Example: suppose that

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      ``1'', ``2'' should both occur an even number of times
    \item
      ``3'' should occur a multiple of 5 times

    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Use the product rule
  \item
    Partition \([n]\) into 5 subsets \(S_i\), assign letter \(i\) to
    \(S_i\).
  \item
    Put a ``be an even set'' structure on \(S_ 1, S_2\) which has EGF
    \(A_1(x) A_2(x) = \cosh(x)\)
  \item
    Put a ``be a set with a multiple of 3 elements'' structure on
    \(S_3\), which has EGF
    \(A_3(x) = (1 + 0x + 0x^2 + 0x^3 + 0x^4 + \frac{1}{5!}x^5 + 0x^6 + \cdots\)
  \item
    Put a ``be a nonempty set'' structure on \(S_4, S_5\) which has EGF
    \(A_4(x) = A_5(x) = e^x - 1\)
  \item
    Use the prodcut rule to obtain \[

  EGF for \(a_n = \#\theset{\text{Subsets of $[n]$}}\):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For any given \(n\), take an arbitrary set partition of \([n]\) into
    blocks \(S_1 = A, S_2 = A^c\). Then put a ``be a set'' structure on
    \(A_1\), and a ``be a set'' structure on \(A_2\). This yields
    \[A(x) = (e^x)e^x \implies a_n = 2^n.\]
  \end{itemize}
\item
  EGF for \(a_n = \#\theset{\text{Nonempty Subsets of $[n]$}}\):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For any given \(n\), take an ordered set partition \([n]\) into
    blocks \(S_1 = A, S_2 = A^c\). Then put a ``be a non-empty set''
    structure on \(A_1\), and a ``be a set'' structure on \(A_2\). This
    yields \[A(x) = (e^x - 1)e^x \implies a_n = 2^n - 1.\]

\item
  EGF for
  \(a_n = \#\theset{\text{Ways to choose $k$ subsets of $[n]$}}\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Partition \([n]\) into exactly \(k\) blocks \(S_1, \cdots S_k\), and
    put the ``be a set'' structure on all of them. This yields
    \[A(x) = (e^x)^k \implies a_n = k^n.\]
  \end{itemize}
\item
  EGF for \(a_n = \#\theset{\text{Partitions of $[n]$ into $k$ parts}}\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Notice that \(a_n = S(n, k) = \stirling n k\)
  \item
    Partition \([n]\) into exactly \(k\) blocks \(S_1, \cdots S_k\), and
    put the ``be a non-empty set'' structure on all of them. This yields
    \[A(x) = (e^x-1)^k \implies a_n = k! \stirling{n}{k}.\]
  \item
    Note -- solving for \(a_n\) here takes some non-trivial
    identifications, namely that a ordered arbitrary choice of \(k\)
    nonempty subsets is a set partition into \(k\) nonempty blocks,
    while in this product we are introducing an ordering of the \(k\)
    blocks.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  EGF for
  \(a_n = \#\theset{\text{Partions of $[n]$ into any \# of parts}}\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Notice that
    \(a_n = \displaystyle\sum_k S(n, k) = \displaystyle\sum_k \stirling n k\).
    We'll use the \textbf{composition rule}.
  \item
    Partition \([n]\) into \emph{any} number of blocks \(\theset{B_i}\).
  \item
    Put a ``be a non-empty set'' structure on each block, which has EGF
    \(B(x) = e^x - 1\).
  \item
    Put a ``be a set'' structure on \emph{the collection} of blocks,
    which has EGF \(C(x) = e^x\). \[
    A(x) = C(B(x)) = e^{e^x - 1}
    \]
  \end{itemize}
\item
  EGF for
  \(a_n = \#\theset{\text{Partitions of $[n]$ into only even parts}}\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We'll use the \textbf{composition rule}.
  \item
    Partition \([n]\) into any number of blocks.
  \item
    Put a ``be a nonempty set with an even number of elements''
    structure on each block, which has EGF \(B(x) = \cosh(x) -1\)
  \item
    Put a ``be a set'' structure on the collection of blocks, which has
    EGF \(C(x) = e^x\) to obtain \[
    A(x) = C(B(x)) = e^{\cosh x}.
    \]
  \end{itemize}
\item
  EGF for
  \(a_n = \#\theset{\text{Permutations $\sigma \in S_n$ with no fixed points}}\)
  (Derangements)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Let the unknown EGF be \(D(x)\). We can enumerate the number of
    permutations by how many points they fix. For a given \(n\),
    partition \([n]\) into two arbitrary blocks \(A_1, A_2\) where we
    will put a fixed-point structure on \(A_1\) and a derangement
    structure on \(A_2\).
  \item
    There is only one way to write down a permutation that fixes every
    element, so the EGF for \(A_1\) is \(e^x\)
  \item
    The EGF for \(A_2\) is \(D(x)\), which is the unknown.
  \item
    The total number of permutations is \(n!\), which has EGF
    \(\frac 1 {1-x}\)
  \item
    So we can conclude that
    \[e^x D(x) = \frac{1}{1-x} \implies D(x) = \frac{1}{e^x(1-x)}.\]
  \end{itemize}
\item
  EGF for
  \(a_n = \#\theset{\text{Words over $\Sigma = \theset{\alpha, \beta, \gamma} \suchthat \# \alpha, \#\beta$ are even }}\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Split \([n]\) into 3 arbitrary ordered parts \(A_1, A_2, A_3\) where
    \(\alpha\) will go in \(A_1\), \(\beta\) in \(A_2\), and
    \(\gamma \in A_3\). Put a ``be a set of even size'' structure on
    \(A_1, A_2\) and a ``be a set'' structure on \(A_3\) to obtain \[
    A(x) = \cosh(x)^2 e^x = \frac{1}{4}(e^{3x} + 2e^x + e^{-x}) \implies a_n = \frac{1}{4}(3^n + 2 + (-1)^n)
    \] \emph{(Using coefficient extraction via derivatives)}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  EGF for
  \(a_n = \#\theset{\text{Permutations that are products of disjoint transpositions}}\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Split \([n]\) into \emph{any number of parts}, and on each part put
    the structure of ``be a fixed point or be a 2-cycle''. This has
    generating function \(S_i(x) = x + \frac{x^2}{2}\), so we obtain \[
    A(x) = e^{x + \frac{x^2}{2}} \implies a_n = \text{ complicated}
    \]

\section{Posets}\label{posets}}

Definition: A \emph{poset} (partially-ordered set) is a pair
\((S, \preceq)\) where \(\preceq\) is a relation on \(S\) that is

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Transitive: \[
  \forall a,b,c \in S,\quad a \preceq b \text{ and } b \preceq c \implies a \preceq c
  \]
\item
  Reflexive: \[
  \forall a\in S,\quad a \preceq a
  \]
\item
  Anti-symmetric \[
  \forall a,b\in S,\quad a \preceq b \text{ and } b \preceq a \implies a = b
  \]
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
Notice that this behaves very much like \((\ZZ, \leq)\), so we'll often
used \(\leq\) to denote the relation. However, there is an important
distinction -- there may be incomparable elements, i.e.~pairs
\(a,b \in S\) such that neither \(a\leq b\) or \(b\leq a\) holds. This
is why the order is ``partial''. Also note that it makes sense in this
setting to write things like \(a< b\), which just means \(a\leq b\) and
\(a\neq b\).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
If every two elements are comparable, \(\preceq\) is called \emph{total
order} and \((S, \preceq)\) is called a \emph{chain}. Weakening this
condition slightly, if for every two elements \(x,y\in S\) there exists
some \(s\in S\) such that \(s\leq x\) and \(s \leq y\), we say \(S\) is
a \emph{directed} poset.
\end{quote}

Examples:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \((\ZZ, \leq)\) is a chain.
\item
  \((\NN, \mid)\) where \(a\mid b \iff a\text{ divides } b\) is a poset.
\item
  \((\mathcal{P}([n]), \subseteq)\) (denoting the powerset) is a poset.
\item
  \((\theset{\text{Set partitions of $[n]$}}, \preceq)\) where
  \(a \preceq b \iff\) every block of \(a\) is contained in some block
  of \(b\) is a poset.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Note that this says that \(b\) can be obtained by merging some
    blocks of \(a\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

An \emph{open section} of a poset is defined as
\[S_\alpha = \theset{s \in S \suchthat s < \alpha}.\] A \emph{closed
section} is defined as
\[\overline{S_\alpha} = \theset{s \in S \suchthat s \leq \alpha}.\] The
\emph{complement} of a section is given by \[
S_x^c = \theset{s\in S \suchthat s \geq a} \\
\overline{S_x}^c = \theset{s\in S \suchthat s > a}
\]

We can define the notions of an \emph{open interval from \(\alpha\) to
\(\beta\)}, \emph{closed interval}, and \emph{half-open intervals}
respectively: \[
\begin{aligned}
(\alpha, \beta) &\definedas \theset{s\in S \suchthat \alpha < s < \beta}\\
[\alpha, \beta] &\definedas \theset{s\in S \suchthat \alpha \leq s \leq \beta}\\
(\alpha, \beta] &\definedas \theset{s\in S \suchthat \alpha < s \leq \beta}\\
[\alpha, \beta) &\definedas \theset{s\in S \suchthat \alpha \leq s < \beta}.
\end{aligned}
\]

Definition: we say that \(y\) \emph{covers} \(x\) if \[
x \in S_y \text{ (so $x < y$) and } (x,y) = \emptyset.
\] In other words, this says that \(y\) is a \emph{least upper bound}
for \(x\).

Definition: If \(S_x = \emptyset\), \(x\) is said to be a \emph{minimal}
element. Similarly, if \(\overline{S_y} = S\), \(y\) is said to be a
\emph{maximal} element.

\begin{quote}
In a subtle distinction, if \(x \in S_s\) for every \(s\in S\), then
\(x\) is unique and is said to be the \emph{minimum element} and denoted
\(\mathbf 0\). Similarly, if \(S_y = S-\theset{y}\), then \(y\) is said
to be a (not necessarily unique) \emph{maximal} element and is denoted
\(\mathbf 1\).
\end{quote}

Definition: A \emph{Hasse diagram} for a poset \((S, \leq)\) is an graph
obtained by letting the verticies of \(G\) be the elements of \(S\),
connecting a directed edge from \(x\to y\) iff \(y\) covers \(x\),
arranging this graph so all arrows point upwards and incomparable
elements are lined up horizontally.

\begin{quote}
These are generally written without vertex labels or edge directions,
yielding an undirected graph on \(\# S\) vertices.
\end{quote}

Examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \((D(12), \mid)\): the divisors of 12 ordered by divisibility

  \includegraphics{2019-06-08-23-30-20.png}
\item
  \((\mathcal{P}([n]), \subseteq)\): Subsets of \([3]\) ordered by
  inclusion.

  \includegraphics{2019-06-08-23-29-44.png}
\end{itemize}

Definition: A subset of a poset \(U \subseteq S\) is called an
\emph{upper set} if it ``absorbs'' everything above it with respect to
the partial order, i.e. \[
u\in U \implies \forall s\in S, \quad s \geq u \implies s \in U,
\]

or in other words, \(\overline{S_u^c} \subseteq U\)

and similarly, \(L\) is called a \emph{lower set} if it absorbs
everything below it: \[
l \in L \implies \forall s\in S, \quad s \leq u \implies s \in U
\] so \(\overline{S_u} \subseteq L\)

Definition: A subset \(L \subseteq S\) is an \emph{order ideal} if it is
a non-empty directed lower set.

Given any poset, we can define the \emph{incidence algebra} \[
\Af(P) = \theset{f: P \cross P \to \RR \suchthat f(x,y) = 0 \iff x \not\leq y },
\] which are all of the functions on pairs of elements in the poset that
take some values on comparable elements and are just zero otherwise.
Some examples:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The indicator/``dirac delta'' function:
  \(\delta(x,y) = \indicator{x=y}\)
\item
  The zeta function: \(\zeta(x,y) = \indicator{x \leq y}\)
\end{itemize}

This is an \emph{algebra} because it is a vector space over \(\RR\), and
has a bilinear product: \[
(f \ast g)(x, y) = \sum_{t\in[x,y]}f(x,t) g(t, y)
\]

Under this product,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(f\ast 0 = 0\)
\item
  \(f\ast\delta = f\)
\item
  \(f\ast \zeta = \displaystyle\sum_{t\in[x,y]}f(x,t)\)
\end{itemize}

Moreover, if \(f(x,x) \neq 0\), then \(f^{-1}\) exists such that
\(f\ast f^{-1} = \delta\), so we can define \(\mu = \zeta\inv\), which
can be shown has the formula \[
\mu(x,y) = (-1)\sum_{ t \in [x,y)}\zeta(x, t)
\] One thus computes this function inductively up a Hasse diagram.

\item
  Level 4

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \([1,30) = \theset{10,15,6,5,2,3,1} \implies \mu(1,30) = -(1+1+1-1-1-1+1) = -1\)

  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Note that from this, we find that for the divisibility poset, \[
\mu(a, b) = \begin{cases}
  (-1)^k & \frac b a \text{ is a product of k distinct primes} \\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

In general, there is a Mobius inversion formula: \[
g ( x ) = \sum _ { x y \leq \pi } f ( y ) \quad \forall x \in P \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad f ( x ) = \sum _ { x y \leq \pi } \mu ( y , x ) g ( y ) \quad \forall x \in P
\]

which says that if we know that \(g\) on every element and we also know
that it's some linear combination of values of \(f\) (where we don't
necessarily know what any single \(f(x)\) is), we can actually solve for
a single \(f(x)\) and write it as a (weighted) linear combination of
values of \(g\).

If we write the incidence matrix of the poset as \(A\), this
equivalently says \[
g(\vector x) = A f(\vector x) \implies f(\vector x) = A^{-1}g(\vector x) = Mg(\vector x)
\]

where \(M = [\mu(x_i, x_j)]\) is the ``Gram matrix'' of values of the
Mobius function.

\section{Appendix}\label{appendix}}

Some notes on lists:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Note that every \(n\dash\)element list admits an action of \(S_n\)
  where you let any \(\sigma\in S_n\) act on the indices
  (i.e.~reordering the list).
\item
  Note that there is a map from lists to sets, which just forms a set
  out of the element of the list. For example,
  \([a,b,c,b] \mapsto \theset{a,b,c}\). Note that it is not injective in
  general, since for example \([c,b,b,a] \mapsto \theset{a,b,c}\) as
  well. If the \(n\) elements of list are \emph{unique}, however, then
  the action of \(S_n\) is nice enough that you can quotient out by it,
  i.e.~dividing counts by \(n!\).
\item
  So one method of counting is to first form an ordered list of unique
  elements, then identify any two ordered lists if they differ by a
  permutation (i.e.~take the underlying set).
\end{itemize}

Bonus: It can be shown using ordinary generating functions that \[
\stirlingfirst{n}{k} = \frac { 1 } { k ! } \ln ^ { k } \left( \frac { 1 } { 1 - z } \right).
\]

Bonus: a closed formula for the Stirling numbers of the second kind is
given by \[
\stirling n k = \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { k } \frac { ( - 1 ) ^ { k - i } } { k ! } \left( \begin{array} { l } { k } \\ { i } \end{array} \right) i ^ { n },
\] which can be found by using the recurrence to solve for an ordinary
generating function, then using partial fraction decomposition and some
gnarly algebraic manipulations. With a bit more work, you can show \[
\sum_k \stirling n k = \frac 1 e \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{i^n}{i!}.

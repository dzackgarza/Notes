Narrative - building Algebraic Geometry in the 20th century
Include contributions of
Weil, Zariski, Serre
Italian school: Castelnuovo, Enriques and Severi

Technical innovations: schemes, motives and topoi

Important Articles: Kansas and Tohoku

Achievements: Proving the Weil Conjectures
(What are they?)
Suggested that topological methods of cohomology applied to algebraic geometry might have huge consequences for number theory

Most famous work: Foundations of algebraic geometry

The general idea is to shift from considering points of a manifold to certain ideals of a ring of functions on this manifold.

Contributions: Unified many cohomology theories, schemes

> Schemes are important even for geometry over the complex numbers. Ancient Greek geometers already debated whether or not a circle tangent to a line meets it in a "bigger" point than when two lines cross. In scheme theory the answer is simply "yes." With schemes a point of tangency includes an infinitesimal neighborhood of an ordinary point.

Italian school producing incorrect proofs:

> As for a result that was not simply incorrectly proved, but actually false, there is the case of the [Severi bound](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publdoc.html?arg3=&co4=AND&co5=AND&co6=AND&co7=AND&dr=all&pg4=AUCN&pg5=TI&pg6=PC&pg7=MR&pg8=ET&r=1&review_format=html&s4=severi&s5=massimo&s6=&s7=&s8=All&vfpref=html&yearRangeFirst=&yearRangeSecond=&yrop=eq)(*) for the maximum number of singular double points of a surface in P^3. The prediction implies that there are no surfaces in P^3 **of degree 6** with more than 52 nodes, but in fact there are such surfaces in P^3 with 65 nodes such as the Barth sextic

# The Math

**Definition**:
Given a field $\mathbb{K}$ and a projective space $\mathbb{P}^n = \{ (a_i)_n \in \mathbb{K} / 0 \} /\sim$ where $(a_i)_n \sim (\lambda a_i)_n$ for $\lambda \in \mathbb{K}/0$, if $F \in \mathbb{K}[\{x_i\}_n]$ is a polynomial in $n$ variables, a **projective variety** is given by $Z(F) = \{ (a_i)_n \in \mathbb{P}^n \vert F((a_i)_n) = 0\}$, the zero set of this polynomial.

*Examples*:

$$\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{C}) = \mathbb{C}\cup\inf \cong S^2$$
$$ \mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C}) \cong S^1 \times S^1 $$

**Definition**
Singularity

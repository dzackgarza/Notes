# Fermat's Last Theorem

First case, due to Kumar. Here's what we'll show:

**Theorem:** Take a prime $p > 3$, assume $p$ is *regular* (i.e. $p\not\mid h_{\QQ(\zeta_p)}$the class number). Then $x^p + y^p = z^p \implies xyz = 0 \mod p$.

Krummer's Criterion: $p$ is irregular (so $p \mid h_{\QQ(\zeta_p)})$ iff $\text{ord}_p(B_k) > 0$ for some $k = 2,3,\cdots p-3$, where $B_k$ is a Bernoulli Number. 
$\frac{z}{e^z-1} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty B_n \frac{z^n}{n!}, \abs{z} < 2\pi$.

Infinitely many irregular - known, 39%

Herbrand-Ribet: $A = \text{Cl}_{\QQ(\zeta_p)}, C = A/A^p$ is an $\FF_p$ vector space where $C = 0 \iff p \not\mid h$.

$G = \text{Gal}(\QQ(\zeta_p) / \QQ) \cong (\ZZ/p\ZZ)^\times$ is cyclic, so its dual group is also cyclic $\hat G = <x>$ where $X \cdot G \into \FF_p^\times$ is the cyclotomic character $X(\sigma) = [a]$ if $\sigma(\zeta_p) = \zeta_p^a$.



So fix an even $2 \leq k \leq p-3$. Then $\text{ord}_p(B_k) > 0$ $\iff$ $C(X^{1-k}) \neq 0$. (Only known to be iff this past century!)
Was known assuming Vandiver's conjecture: $p\not\mid h_{\QQ(\zeta_p + \zeta_p^{-1})}$. Ribet was able to bypass using Galois representations associated to modular forms. Under this assumption, create a cusp form congruent to an Eisenstein series$\mod p$. Move back into Galois side to recover nontriviality on RHS.

Idea: Factor both sides in the cyclotomic field, so really need to know units in these fields.

There is a natural notion (intrinsic) of conjugation on the cyclotomic field. Take $K_n = \QQ(\zeta), \text{ord}(\zeta) = n, \zeta \in \bar\QQ$.

Then $\text{Gal}(K_n/\QQ) \cong (\ZZ/n\ZZ)^\times$ by $c \mapsto [-1]$. Notate by $x \mapsto c(x)$.

Then $c(\zeta) = \zeta^{-1}$, and for all $\sigma: K_n \into \CC, \sigma(\zeta) = e^{2\pi i k n)$

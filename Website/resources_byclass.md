## General Notes on Resources

 Anything lower-division: [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/).

- On Youtube videos: more and more lectures and talks are being posted online. These vary in quality, but this if offset by the fact that you can watch them at 2x speed.

- On video lectures in general: they are a crutch! Use them to supplement and enrich your understanding, but they do not work well as primary resources. The best resources are always materials from your own instructors and courses. Passively watching videos is also not very helpful - take notes, write down timestamps and video titles for important topics, and don't hesitate to rewatch several times.

- [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm): when video lectures are available, generally high quality. Covers a good number of areas, and a good source of practice problems and exams.

- Look for book recommendations for your topic/class in places like Math StackExchange (MSE) or MathOverflow (MO), and don't be afraid to consult multiple books on the same topic. I've had very good luck following the  [reference-request tags](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-request) on these sites.

- If you find an author/lecturer/general source that you particularly like, look up other things from that source! If they cover other topics, be open to learning those -- Math is quite interrelated, and later topics will be easier to learn when you have a collection of concepts you can "hang your hat on".

- For lower division or introductory courses, try to obtain a textbook paired with a solutions manual. This is a great way to drill problems, check your answers, and identify your weaknesses. Beware typos!

- Don't bother with sites like Chegg.

- For computational courses: Schaum's Outlines can be useful, but the quality is _very_ subject-dependent.

- Learn how to use a Computer Algebra System (CAS). Don't use it as a crutch - just learn enough syntax so that you can quickly run "sanity checks" on your computations. [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/) is a good for quick things.

	- If you have the time, learn something like [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/index.html), which can do symbolic computations and can even be used for things like group theory and algebra.

 Below are resources for specific courses/subjects; I've tried to roughly organize these by increasing complexity with respect to a typical undergraduate Math degree.

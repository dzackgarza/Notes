If you find yourself asking "What book should I get to learn $X$", then you have come to the right place! This is a question I personally get asked a lot, and it also seems to come up roughly daily in various online Math communities, so I put together this list to point out some resources I've personally used and found helpful for various topics and courses.

_Disclaimer: in the textbook section, a number of the outgoing Amazon links are affiliate links! These help cover the hosting cost of this site, but you should also be aware that many of these books are often available at university libraries, at cheaper resalers, or often even as PDFs floating around online._

## Extracurricular Math
- :fa-book: _Garrity_, [All the Mathematics You Missed: But Need to Know for Graduate School](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521797071/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0521797071&linkCode=as2&tag=dzackgarza-20&linkId=a599d541b5c474b2a50177e0cda4b379)<div id="garrity"></div>
	- If you're thinking about grad school at all, read this! Even if you're not, it's a pretty good collection of mathematics that it's good to at least be familiar with. You can also use this to get an idea of some of the major theorems and results in a variety of subfields.
- :fa-tv: :fa-star: [Introduction to Higher Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZzHxk_TPOStgPtqRZ6KzmkUQBQ8TSWVX)
	- A great survey that highlights many different areas of advanced mathematics.
- :fa-book: _Abbott_, [Flatland](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/048627263X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=048627263X&linkId=1f5b4e9ec20ad3c1ebd5cd2af429be68)
	- As the professor who recommended this to me said, reading this book is an absolutely essential step in the professional development of every mathematician. It's a short fiction that explores a world of 1-dimensional beings that live in a 2-dimensional universe, which provides a powerful analogy for thinking about higher dimensional objects.

## Computer Science
- :fa-book: _CLRS_, [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033844/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262033844&linkCode=as2&tag=dzackgarza-20&linkId=f99bf4ce12d3ed422a41b841a3055d75)
	- :fa-external-link-alt: [MIT OCW: Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/index.htm) is a good supplement.
- :fa-book: _McDowell_, [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782850/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0984782850&linkCode=as2&tag=dzackgarza-20&linkId=10277ceaad2b2e90ef6a1b321b555ffd)
	- Covers a number of quintessential CS interview questions, worth reading if you are preparing for internships.
- :fa-book: _Sipser_, [Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8131525295/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=8131525295&linkId=8b4d166a094b0d45b504ea7f4da63727)
	- The standard resource for an introduction to theoretical computer science. Covers things like computability, automata, and Turing machines.
- :fa-book: _Graham and Knuth_, [Concrete Mathematics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201558025/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0201558025&linkId=d0e1989fdcb7ee7be5595099a9267a00)
	- An encylopedaic reference for a huge swath of discrete Mathematics.

## The Math Subject GRE

If you are thinking about applying to graduate school in Mathematics (pure or applied), I would recommend that you start looking at the material for this exam within your first few years, and take it as soon as your Junior year.

Note that the Math Subject GRE is vastly different than the Math portion of the General GRE. The latter covers primarily high-school level mathematics and requires no courses beyond Calculus (although the questions can still be tricky). The former is over 50% Calculus, and often includes a wide variety of upper-division topics as well. Many sources confuse these two exams!

**Topics**
- Single Variable Calculus
- Multivariable Calculus
- Ordinary Differential Equations
- Linear Algebra
- Complex Analysis
- Abstract Algebra
	- Primarily groups and rings, virtually no module or Galois theory.
- Probability/Statistics
- Real Analysis
	- Convergence of sums/sequences, topological properties of $\RR$.
- Combinatorics
	- Graph theory, counting problems
- Point-Set Topology
- Numerical Analysis
- Set Theory and Logic

**Resources**
- :fa-external-link-alt: You can find five sample exams [here.](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~iacoley/greprep.html)
- :fa-book: Princeton Review, [Cracking the Math Subject GRE](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375429727/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dzackgarza-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0375429727&linkId=a8d125e03d8fa03bd5e41231a88252d1)

**Advice**
- Most problems don't require extensive computations; there is usually a trick that solves it very quickly.
- Time is the most difficult factor, be sure to take timed practice tests. You have right around two minutes per problem.
- Sign up early, as these exams are often only held a few times per year.

- Reviews of some of the big Math-related Youtubers:
	- VSauce - 2/10
		- Often hints at neat concepts, but usually focused on "pop-math". The cotton candy of the Math video world.
	- Mathologer - 9/10
		- Rigorous without drowning in technical details, and good topic selection!
	- PBS Infinite Series - 9/10
		- Topics are much closer to "serious" math, and are often accompanied with proofs.
	- Numberphile - 7/10
		- Often eschews rigorous explanations, which leads to a very misinformed public! Many good interviews, though.
	- 3blue1brow - 8/10
		- Amazing visualization, topics are interesting but are less serious. Good for general conceptual understanding.
- Some interesting Math-related movies:
	- Good Will Hunting
	- A Beautiful Mind (John Nash)
	- The Man Who Knew Infinity (Srinivasa Ramanujan)
	- The Imitation Game (Alan Turing)
	- Proof
	- The Theory of Everything

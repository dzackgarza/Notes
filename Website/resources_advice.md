## For Incoming Math Majors
- Start thinking about whether or not grad school as an option. You don't have to *decide* within your first year, but you'll want to pick courses accordingly.

- Get an idea of what Math is all about - there are great things beyond Calculus!
	- To get an idea of what you're in for as a Math major, take a look at the GRE Mathematics Subject Exam. It covers a broad array of pretty standardized topics.
	- Also take a look Garrity's book ([linked in the resources section](#garrity)) for a short, condensed survey of some of the major topics and theorems you'll encounter.
	- One thing that was helpful to me was to make [graphs and diagrams](world-of-math) of different areas of Math I encountered. Take a look, knowing the landscape you're traversing is valuable.

- Learn Latex and Mathjax early, and then make efforts to regularly typeset your written notes.

- It may be intimidating, but try to find ways to talk to your professors outside of class. Don't hesitate to ask for advice related to Math or your academic career. In my experience, they are usually happy to help.

- For those aiming for grad school, particularly in pure Math: here are what I would consider some of the most essential, core classes to take:
	- Calculus (of course)
	- Linear Algebra
	- Ordinary Differential Equations
	- Abstract Algebra
	- Real Analysis
	- Point-Set Topology

	Here are some "nice-to-haves" -- still important, still beautiful, and great electives, but missing out on them in undergrad isn't the end of the world:
	- Probability
	- Combinatorics
	- Complex Analysis
	- Number Theory
	- Discrete Math (e.g. Graph Theory)
	- More Linear Algebra (e.g. Numerical Analysis)

	Of course, I recommend taking as many Math courses as possible -- explore the subject and discover what you like! But the ideas and concepts from these particular courses are relevant to just about any area you might go into, so having some exposure to them makes life much easier (regardless of what you pursue).


## On Learning and Being a Student
- **Start everything early**: Starting early gives you time to mull over questions and potentially visit professors/TAs for help.
- **Use a wide variety of resources**: Books, lectures, notes, PDFs -- use them all! The search modifiers `inurl:edu filetype:pdf` on Google are incredibly useful.
- **Extensively use good resources**: There is also some value in working a single, particularly well-regarded book, front to back.
- **Spaced repetition**: read up on it, and work it into your study habits. Cramming has diminishing returns in proof-based classes, you are much better served by visiting and revisiting material often enough to be familiar with it.
- **Sleep like it is your hobby.** Two hours of extra sleep is almost always a more efficient use of your time than two hours of tired studying.

## On Learning Mathematics Specifically
- **Vocabulary**: for any new topic, it can be helpful to make a list of definitions and simply memorize them. Math is (at least partially) a language, so it is worth (partially) learning it like one!
- **Use multiple books**: For most undergraduate topics, there are many "standard" references. Use them all! Cross-reference liberally as well.
- **Get the definitions down cold**: Record every single definition you come across and just do whatever you have to do to memorize them! Some people like flash cards, I personally make a "dictionary" document for each subject. Meaning and understanding is often a gradual process, but knowing the full statement of a definition should just be automatic. I like to think of definitions as the analog "multiplication tables" within higher Mathematics -- is it essential to memorize? Well no, but you also wouldn't want to waste time stopping to multiply out $12^2$ when you're trying to solve an integral.
- **Synthesize often:** This includes things like revising class notes, making your own "cheat sheets", writing up explanations of particular theorems or motivations for certain concepts, etc. Even better, find ways to give talks or teach other people! Present things as if you were trying to teach yourself the topic 6-12 months in the past.
- **Google for PDF notes**: For just about any topic at any level of specificty, someone has probably written up notes or expository explanations and shared them online. So it can be extremely beneficial to look through the first page or two of Google results using `filetype:pdf` for any concept or proof you happen to be studying and see how other mathematicians think about and present them.
- **Work a lot of problems/proofs**: Do more than you are assigned, but be judicious with your time! If you stare at a problem for more than an hour or two without making progress, pivot. Sometimes the best way to make progress on a problem is to take a break, work on something different, or sleep on it. A relevant quote from Alexander Grothendieck:
	>I can illustrate the approach with the image of a nut to be opened. The first analogy that came to my mind is of immersing the nut in some softening liquid, and why not simply water? From time to time you rub so the liquid penetrates better, and otherwise you let time pass. The shell becomes more flexible through weeks and months — when the time is ripe, hand pressure is enough, the shell opens like a perfectly ripened avocado!
- **Work the exams**, and if possible, do them in a timed setting.

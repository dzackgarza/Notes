# Homological Algebra



## What is it?

"Homology" as a word just denotes some kind of study of "sameness", which depends on what context you're in.

It arose out of topology, where we are interested in studying when two manifolds are the "same" up to certain kinds of maps. Most generally, we look at continuous maps between spaces, but one could also look at smooth maps (differential geometry), or holomorphic maps (complex analysis).

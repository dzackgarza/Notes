## Title of Project



## Abstract (250 Words)

Homology is a relatively new branch of mathematics, developed in the early to mid 20th century to address problems related to distinguishing and classifying certain types of mathematical spaces. It has proved to be a widely successful tool in these areas, and in recent years has been shown to be useful in a variety of other contexts as well. One emerging application is the field of topological data analysis, which uses homology to compute the "holes" in large dimensional data sets. Industrial applications include analysis of networks such as cellular towers, in order to determine gaps or "holes" in coverage areas. Homology also has a number of applications in pure mathematics, spawning an fruitful branch of research termed "Homological Algebra", as well as applications to the study of fluids, time series data, signal processing, and electrodynamics. Recent breakthroughs include the use of a related tool, "Persistent Homology", to analyze large collections of images which were found to have the homological characteristics of a well-known and well-studied mathematical object, the Klein bottle. A similar recent paper applied this tool to experimental data concerning the neural responses in the visual cortex of a group of primates, unearthing new underlying structures that were previously thought ot be random. 

While it is possible to compute homology for many types of objects and spaces, this information is scattered throughout textbooks and research papers. The goal of this project is to collect data for a wide variety of these spaces, including the computations of their homology, and to collect them together into a single, easily accessible reference.

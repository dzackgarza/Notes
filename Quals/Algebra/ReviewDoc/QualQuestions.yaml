    question: |
      Let $G$ be a finite group with $n$ distinct conjugacy classes.
      Let $g_1 \cdots g_n$ be representatives of the conjugacy classes of $G$.

      Prove that if $g_i g_j = g_j g_i$ for all $i, j$ then $G$ is abelian.

      Let $F$ be a finite field with $q$ elements.

      Let $n$ be a positive integer relatively prime to $q$ and let $\omega$ be a primitive $n$th root of unity in an extension field of $F$.

      Let $E = F [\omega]$ and let $k = [E : F]$.

      (a) Prove that $n$ divides $q^{k}-1$.

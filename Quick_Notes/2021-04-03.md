> The connections between FGLs and homotopy are key. Read Quillen's paper, J.F. Adams' blue book, Ravenel, etc. Ravenel has some slides on Quillen's work (good entry pt). If you really want to go in depth, I enjoyed learning from Hazewinkel's book "Formal Groups and Applications".

- Don't set goals to be outcome-dependent.
  Set input goals!
  E.g. "Write a book that I'm proud of and I like."

- Check in with your emotional state.
  It's not always healthy to push through not feeling like doing something.
  This can be useful if it's a matter of discipline, i.e. if pushing through is actually serving you well.
  But it can also serve you poorly in the long run by exacerbating poor mental state or leading to burnout.

- It's okay to take a break.
  Check in to ask yourself if it's coming from a place of self-care or instead procrastination.

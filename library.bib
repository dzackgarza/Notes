abstract = {The landscape of homological algebra has evolved over the past half-century into a fundamental tool for the working mathematician. This book provides a unified account of homological algebra as it exists today. The historical connection with topology, regular local rings, and semi-simple Lie algebras is also described. The first half of the book takes as its subject the canonical topics in homological algebra: derived functors, Tor and Ext, projective dimensions and spectral sequences. Homology of group and Lie algebras illustrate these topics. Intermingled are less canonical topics, such as the derived inverse limit functor lim1, local cohomology, Galois cohomology, and affine Lie algebras. The last part of the book covers less traditional topics that are a vital part of the modern homological toolkit: simplicial methods, Hochschild and cyclic homology, derived categories and total derived functors.},

abstract = {Topological data analysis provides a multiscale description of the geometry and topology of quantitative data. The persistence landscape is a topological summary that can be easily combined with tools from statistics and machine learning. We give efficient algorithms for calculating persistence landscapes, their averages, and distances between such averages. We discuss an implementation of these algorithms and some related procedures. These are intended to facilitate the combination of statistics and machine learning with topological data analysis. We present an experiment showing that the low-dimensional persistence landscapes of points sampled from spheres (and boxes) of varying dimensions differ.},

To show that these notions of fibration are indeed distinct, one needs to understand how iterates of Kan's Ex functor act on graphs and on nerves of small categories.},

The first three chapters of Functional Analysis: Fundamentals and Applications describe the general notions of distance, integral and norm, as well as their relations. The three chapters that follow deal with fundamental examples: Lebesgue spaces, dual spaces and Sobolev spaces. Two subsequent chapters develop applications to capacity theory and elliptic problems. In particular, the isoperimetric inequality and the P{\'{o}}lya-Szegő and Faber-Krahn inequalities are proved by purely functional methods. The epilogue contains a sketch of the history of functional analysis, in relation with integration and differentiation. Starting from elementary analysis and introducing relevant recent research, this work is an excellent resource for students in mathematics and applied mathematics.},

abstract = {TV program review services, especially drama review services, are one of the most popular video on demand services on the Web. In this paper, we propose a novel video abstraction model for a review service of story-oriented video such as dramas. In a drama review service, viewers want to understand the story in a short time and service providers want to provide video abstracts at minimum cost. The proposed model enables the automatic creation of a video abstract that still allows viewers to understand the overall story of the source video. Also, the model has a flexible structure so that the duration of an abstract can be adjusted depending on the requirements given by viewers. We get clues for human understanding of a story from scenario writing rules and editorial techniques which are popularly used in the process of video producing. We have implemented the proposed model and successfully applied it to several TV dramas.},

abstract = {This paper discusses basic properties of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces K(G, n), their cohomology groups and some classic applications. We construct K(G, n) using both CW complexes and classifying spaces. Two proofs are given to the basic fact that cohomology of a CW complex X has 1-1 correspondence with homotopy classes of maps from X into Eilenberg-MacLane spaces: a barehanded proof (original) and a categorical proof using loop spaces. We use it to demonstrate the connection between cohomology operations and cohomology groups of K(G, n)'s. Finally we use the technique of spectral sequence to compute the cohomology of some classes of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, and apply it to the calculation $\pi$ 5 (S 3).},

abstract = {Since the publication of its first edition, this book has served as one of the few available on the classical Adams spectral sequence, and is the best account on the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. This new edition has been updated in many places, especially the final chapter, which has been completely rewritten with an eye toward future research in the field. It remains the definitive reference on the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The first three chapters introduce the homotopy groups of spheres and take the reader from the classical results in the field though the computational aspects of the classical Adams spectral sequence and its modifications, which are the main tools topologists have to investigate the homotopy groups of spheres. Nowadays, the most efficient tools are the Brown-Peterson theory, the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, and the chromatic spectral sequence, a device for analyzing the global structure of the stable homotopy groups of spheres and relating them to the cohomology of the Morava stabilizer groups. These topics are described in detail in Chapters 4 to 6. The revamped Chapter 7 is the computational payoff of the book, yielding a lot of information about the stable homotopy group of spheres. Appendices follow, giving self-contained accounts of the theory of formal group laws and the homological algebra associated with Hopf algebras and Hopf algebroids. The book is intended for anyone wishing to study computational stable homotopy theory. It is accessible to graduate students with a knowledge of algebraic topology and recommended to anyone wishing to venture into the frontiers of the subject.},

Starting with a survey, in non-category-theoretic terms, of many familiar and not-so-familiar constructions in algebra (plus two from topology for perspective), the reader is guided to an understanding and appreciation of the general concepts and tools unifying these constructions. Topics include: set theory, lattices, category theory, the formulation of universal constructions in category-theoretic terms, varieties of algebras, and adjunctions. A large number of exercises, from the routine to the challenging, interspersed through the text, develop the reader's grasp of the material, exhibit applications of the general theory to diverse areas of algebra, and in some cases point to outstanding open questions.

About the only disadvantage of this model is that the stable equivalences cannot be defined by inverting those morphisms which induce isomorphisms on homotopy groups, because this would leave too many homotopy types. In this sense the naively defined homotopy groups are often `wrong`, and then their precise relationship to the `true` homotopy groups (i.e., morphisms in the stable homotopy category from sphere spectra) appears mysterious. In this paper I discuss and exploit extra algebraic structure on the naively defined homotopy groups of symmetric spectra, namely a special kind of action of the monoid of injective self maps of the natural numbers. This extra structure clarifies several issues about homotopy groups and stable equivalences and explains why the naive homotopy groups are not so wrong after all. For example, the monoid action allows a simple characterization of semistable symmetric spectra.},

abstract = {We construct a cohomology theory on a category of finite digraphs (directed graphs), which is based on the universal calculus on the algebra of functions on the vertices of the digraph. We develop necessary algebraic technique and apply it for investigation of functorial properties of this theory. We introduce categories of digraphs and (undirected) graphs, and using natural isomorphism between the introduced category of graphs and the full subcategory of symmetric digraphs we transfer our cohomology theory to the category of graphs. Then we prove homotopy invariance of the introduced cohomology theory for undirected graphs. Thus we answer the question of Babson, Barcelo, Longueville, and Laubenbacher about existence of homotopy invariant homology theory for graphs. We establish connections with cohomology of simplicial complexes that arise naturally for some special classes of digraphs. For example, the cohomologies of posets coincide with the cohomologies of a simplicial complex associated with the poset. However, in general the digraph cohomology theory can not be reduced to simplicial cohomology. We describe the behavior of digraph cohomology groups for several topological constructions on the digraph level and prove that any given finite sequence of nonnegative integers can be realized as the sequence of ranks of digraph cohomology groups. We present also sufficiently many examples that illustrate the theory.},

@article{Apostol1963,
abstract = {This book is a continuation of the author's Calculus, Volume I, Second Edition. The present volume has been written with the same underlying philosophy that prevailed in the first. Sound training in technique is combined with a strong theoretical development. Every effort has been made to convey the spirit of modern mathematics without undue emphasis on formalization. As in Volume I, historical remarks are included to give the student a sense of participation in the evolution of ideas. The second volume is divided into three parts, entitled Linear Analysis, Nonlinear Ana!ysis, and Special Topics. The last two chapters of Volume I have been repeated as the first two chapters of Volume II so that all the material on linear algebra will be complete in one volume. Part 1 contains an introduction to linear algebra, including linear transformations, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues, and quadratic forms. Applications are given to analysis, in particular to the study of linear differential equations. Systems of differential equations are treated with the help of matrix calculus. Existence and uniqueness theorems are proved by Picard's method of successive approximations, which is also cast in the language of contraction operators. Part 2 discusses the calculus of functions of several variables. Differential calculus is unified and simplified with the aid of linear algebra. It includes chain rules for scalar and vector fields, and applications to partial differential equations and extremum problems. Integral calculus includes line integrals, multiple integrals, and surface integrals, with applications to vector analysis. Here the treatment is along more or less classical lines and does not include a formal development of differential forms. The special topics treated in Part 3 are Probability and Numerical Analysis. The material on probability is divided into two chapters, one dealing with finite or countably infinite sample spaces; the other with uncountable sample spaces, random variables, and dis- tribution functions. The use of the calculus is illustrated in the study of both one- and two-dimensional random variables. The last chapter contains an introduction to numerical analysis, the chief emphasis being on different kinds of polynomial approximation. Here again the ideas are unified by the notation and terminology of linear algebra. The book concludes with a treatment of approximate integration formulas, such as Simpson's rule, and a discussion of Euler's summation formula. There is ample material in this volume for a full year's course meeting three or four times per week. It presupposes a knowledge of one-variable calculus as covered in most first-year calculus courses. The author has taught this material in a course with two lectures and two recitation periods per week, allowing about ten weeks for each part and omitting the starred sections. This second volume has been planned so that many chapters can be omitted for a variety of shorter courses. For example, the last chapter of each part can be skipped without disrupting the continuity of the presentation. Part 1 by itself provides material for a com- bined course in linear algebra and ordinary differential equations. The individual instructor can choose topics to suit his needs and preferences by consulting the diagram on the next page which shows the logical interdependence of the chapters. Once again I acknowledge with pleasure the assistance of many friends and colleagues. In preparing the second edition I received valuable help from Professors Herbert S. Zuckerman of the University of Washington, and Basil Gordon of the University of California, Los Angeles, each of whom suggested a number of improvements. Thanks are also due to the staff of Blaisdell Publishing Company for their assistance and cooperation. As before, it gives me special pleasure to express my gratitude to my wife for the many ways in which she has contributed. In grateful acknowledgement I happily dedicate this book to her.},

abstract = {This text is designed for an introductory probability course at the university level for sophomores, juniors, and seniors in mathematics, physical and social sciences, engineering, and computer science. It presents a thorough treatment of ideas and techniques necessary for a firm understanding of the subject. The text is also recommended for use in discrete probability courses. The material is organized so that the discrete and continuous probability discussions are presented in a separate, but parallel, manner. This organization does not emphasize an overly rigorous or formal view of probabililty and therefore offers some strong pedagogical value. Hence, the discrete discussions can sometimes serve to motivate the more abstract continuous probability discussions. Features: Key ideas are developed in a somewhat leisurely style, providing a variety of interesting applications to probability and showing some nonintuitive ideas. Over 600 exercises provide the opportunity for practicing skills and developing a sound understanding of ideas. Numerous historical comments deal with the development of discrete probability. The text includes many computer programs that illustrate the algorithms or the methods of computation for important problems. Readership Instructors of mathematics, physical and social science, engineering, and computer science interested in probability theory and stochastic processes.

abstract = {In mathematics, hyperbolic geometry (also called Lobachevskian geometry or Bolyai- Lobachevskian geometry) is a non-Euclidean geometry, meaning that the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry is replaced. The parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry is equivalent to the statement that, in two dimensional space, for any given line R and point P not on R, there is exactly one line through P that does not intersect R; i.e., that is parallel to R. In hyperbolic geometry there are at least two distinct lines through P which do not intersect R, so the parallel postulate is false. Models have been constructed within Euclidean geometry that obey the axioms of hyperbolic geometry, thus proving that the parallel postulate is independent of the other postulates of Euclid.},

Here, we developed a comprehensible and scalable CFD model based on the conservative unstructured finite volume methodology to bring new insights from the perspective of catalytic reactor engineering to gas-liquid-solid catalytic wet oxidation. First, the heterogeneous flow constitutive equations of the trickle bed system have been derived by means of diffusion-convection-reaction model coupled within a Volume-of-Fluid framework. The multiphase model was investigated to gain further evidence on how the effect of process variables such as liquid velocity, surface tension and wetting phenomena affect the overall performance of high-pressure trickle-bed reactor. Second, as long as the application of under-relaxation parameters, mesh density, and time stepping strategy play a major role on the final corroboration, several computational runs on the detoxification of liquid pollutants were validated accordingly and evaluated in terms of convergence and stability criteria. Finally, the analysis of spatial mappings for the reaction properties enables us to identify the existence of relevant dry zones and unveil the channeling phenomena within in the trickle-bed reactor.},

However, over the last decade two interesting new lines of research have emerged, one focusing on algorithms for algebraic topology, and the other on applications of algebraic topology in engineering and science. Amongst the new areas in which the techniques have been applied are computer vision and image processing. In this paper, we survey the results of these endeavours. Because algebraic topology is an area of mathematics with which most computer vision practitioners have no experience, we review the machinery behind the theories of homology and persistent homology; our review emphasizes intuitive explanations. In terms of applications to computer vision, we focus on four illustrative problems: shape signatures, natural image statistics, image denoising, and segmentation. Our hope is that this review will stimulate interest on the part of computer vision researchers to both use and extend the tools of this new field},

abstract = {Spectral sequences are a powerful book-keeping tool for proving things involving com-plicated commutative diagrams. They were introduced by Leray in the 1940's at the same time as he introduced sheaves. They have a reputation for being abstruse and difficult. It has been suggested that the name 'spectral' was given because, like spectres, spectral sequences are terrifying, evil, and dangerous. I have heard no one disagree with this interpretation, which is perhaps not surprising since I just made it up. Nonetheless, the goal of this note is to tell you enough that you can use spectral se-quences without hesitation or fear, and why you shouldn't be frightened when they come up in a seminar. What is different in this presentation is that we will use spectral sequence to prove things that you may have already seen, and that you can prove easily in other ways. This will allow you to get some hands-on experience for how to use them. We will also see them only in a " special case " of double complexes (which is the version by far the most often used in algebraic geometry), and not in the general form usually presented (filtered complexes, exact couples, etc.). See chapter 5 of Weibel's marvelous book for more detailed information if you wish. If you want to become comfortable with spectral sequences, you must try the exercises. For concreteness, we work in the category vector spaces over a given field. However, everything we say will apply in any abelian category, such as the category Mod A of A-modules.},

abstract = {When this book was written, methods of algebraic topology had caused revolutions in the world of pure algebra. To clarify the advances that had been made, Cartan and Eilenberg tried to unify the fields and to construct the framework of a fully fledged theory. The invasion of algebra had occurred on three fronts through the construction of cohomology theories for groups, Lie algebras, and associative algebras. This book presents a single homology (and also cohomology) theory that embodies all three; a large number of results is thus established in a general framework. Subsequently, each of the three theories is singled out by a suitable specialization, and its specific properties are studied.The starting point is the notion of a module over a ring. The primary operations are the tensor product of two modules and the groups of all homomorphisms of one module into another. From these, "higher order" derived of operations are obtained, which enjoy all the properties usually attributed to homology theories.

This book provides a unified account of homological algebra as it exists today. The historical connection with topology, regular local rings, and semi-simple Lie algebras is also described. The first half of the book takes as its subject the canonical topics in homological algebra: derived functors, Tor and Ext, projective dimensions and spectral sequences. Homology of group and Lie algebras illustrate these topics. Intermingled are less canonical topics, such as the derived inverse limit functor lim1, local cohomology, Galois cohomology, and affine Lie algebras. The last part of the book covers less traditional topics that are a vital part of the modern homological toolkit: simplicial methods, Hochschild and cyclic homology, derived categories and total derived functors.},

abstract = {Since the publication of its first edition, this book has served as one of the few available on the classical Adams spectral sequence, and is the best account on the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. This new edition has been updated in many places, especially the final chapter, which has been completely rewritten with an eye toward future research in the field. It remains the definitive reference on the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The first three chapters introduce the homotopy groups of spheres and take the reader from the classical results in the field though the computational aspects of the classical Adams spectral sequence and its modifications, which are the main tools topologists have to investigate the homotopy groups of spheres. Nowadays, the most efficient tools are the Brown-Peterson theory, the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, and the chromatic spectral sequence, a device for analyzing the global structure of the stable homotopy groups of spheres and relating them to the cohomology of the Morava stabilizer groups. These topics are described in detail in Chapters 4 to 6. The revamped Chapter 7 is the computational payoff of the book, yielding a lot of information about the stable homotopy group of spheres. Appendices follow, giving self-contained accounts of the theory of formal group laws and the homological algebra associated with Hopf algebras and Hopf algebroids. The book is intended for anyone wishing to study computational stable homotopy theory. It is accessible to graduate students with a knowledge of algebraic topology and recommended to anyone wishing to venture into the frontiers of the subject.},

We can create the m{\"{o}}bius band by starting with the circle S¹ and (similarly to the case with the cylinder) at each point on the circle attaching a copy of the open interval (0,1), but in a nontrivial manner. Instead of just attaching a bunch of parallel intervals to the circle, our intervals perform a 180° twist as we go around. This gives the manifold a much more interesting geometry. We look at the object we've formed, and note that locally it is indistinguishable from the cylinder. That is, the " twist " in the m{\"{o}}bius band is not located at any particular point on the band; it is entirely a global property of the manifold. Motivated by this example, we seek to generalize the language of product spaces, to include objects like the m{\"{o}}bius band which are only locally a product space. This generalization is what we will come to know as a fiber bundle. Figure 4.2 The mobius band can also be built from a circle and line segment, but using a more general method of construction.},

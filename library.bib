In the present paper, we solve the homotopy limit problem for topological Hochschild homology of X(n), which is a generalized version of the Segal Conjecture for the cyclic group of prime order. We prove the same theorem for T (n) under the assumption that T (n) is an E2-ring spectrum. This is also a first step towards computing algebraic K-theory of X(n) and T (n) using trace methods.},

  abstract = {We use cluster structures and mirror symmetry to explicitly describe a natural class of Newton-Okounkov bodies for Grassmannians. We consider the Grassmannian \$X=Gr\_\{n-k\}(\textbackslash{}mathbb C\^n)\$, as well as the mirror dual Landau-Ginzburg model \$(\textbackslash{}check\{X\}\^\textbackslash{}circ, W\_q:\textbackslash{}check\{X\}\^\textbackslash{}circ \textbackslash{}to \textbackslash{}mathbb C)\$, where \$\textbackslash{}check\{X\}\^\textbackslash{}circ\$ is the complement of a particular anti-canonical divisor in a Langlands dual Grassmannian \$\textbackslash{}check\{X\} = Gr\_k((\textbackslash{}mathbb C\^n)\^*)\$, and the superpotential W\_q has a simple expression in terms of Pl\textbackslash{}"ucker coordinates. Grassmannians simultaneously have the structure of an \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{A\}\$-cluster variety and an \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{X\}\$-cluster variety. Given a cluster seed G, we consider two associated coordinate systems: a \$\textbackslash{}mathcal X\$-cluster chart \$\textbackslash{}Phi\_G:(\textbackslash{}mathbb C\^*)\^\{k(n-k)\}\textbackslash{}to X\^\{\textbackslash{}circ\}\$ and a \$\textbackslash{}mathcal A\$-cluster chart \$\textbackslash{}Phi\_G\^\{\textbackslash{}vee\}:(\textbackslash{}mathbb C\^*)\^\{k(n-k)\}\textbackslash{}to \textbackslash{}check\{X\}\^\textbackslash{}circ\$. To each \$\textbackslash{}mathcal X\$-cluster chart \$\textbackslash{}Phi\_G\$ and ample `boundary divisor' \$D\$ in \$X\textbackslash{}setminus X\^\{\textbackslash{}circ\}\$, we associate a Newton-Okounkov body \$\textbackslash{}Delta\_G(D)\$ in \$\textbackslash{}mathbb R\^\{k(n-k)\}\$, which is defined as the convex hull of rational points. On the other hand using the \$\textbackslash{}mathcal A\$-cluster chart \$\textbackslash{}Phi\_G\^\{\textbackslash{}vee\}\$ on the mirror side, we obtain a set of rational polytopes, described by inequalities, by writing the superpotential \$W\_q\$ in the \$\textbackslash{}mathcal A\$-cluster coordinates, and then "tropicalising". Our main result is that the Newton-Okounkov bodies \$\textbackslash{}Delta\_G(D)\$ and the polytopes obtained by tropicalisation coincide. As an application, we construct degenerations of the Grassmannian to toric varieties corresponding to these Newton-Okounkov bodies. Additionally, when \$G\$ corresponds to a plabic graph, we give a formula for the lattice points of the Newton-Okounkov bodies, which has an interpretation in terms of quantum Schubert calculus.},

In the proof we show that Procesi bundles on Hilbn(C2) for various n, as constructed by Bezrukavnikov and Kaledin, admit an inductive description via the so called nested Hilbert schemes. Our proof of the latter fact is based on studying quantizations of the nested Hilbert schemes in zero and positive characteristic.},

There is some nice combinatorial machinery for describing the intersection numbers. This includes the symmetric Schur polynomials, Young tableaux, and the Littlewood-Richardson rule. Sections 1, 2, and 3 introduce notation and the necessary topological tools. Section 4 uses linear algebra to prove Pieri's formula, which describes the cup product of the cohomology ring in a special case.

  abstract = {In mathematics, and algebraic topology in particular, an Eilenberg\textendash{}MacLane space is a topological space with a single nontrivial homotopy group. As such, an Eilenberg\textendash{}MacLane space is a special kind of topological space that can be regarded as a building block for homotopy theory; general topological spaces can be constructed from these via the Postnikov system. These spaces are important in many contexts in algebraic topology, including constructions of spaces, computations of homotopy groups of spheres, and definition of cohomology operations. The name is for Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane, who introduced such spaces in the late 1940s.
Let G be a group and n a positive integer. A connected topological space X is called an Eilenberg\textendash{}MacLane space of type K(G, n), if it has n-th homotopy group {$\pi$}n(X) isomorphic to G and all other homotopy groups trivial.  If n {$>$} 1 then G must be abelian. Such a space exists, is a CW-complex, and is unique up to a weak homotopy equivalence. By abuse of language, any such space is often called just K(G, n).},

@article{VectorBundle2019,
  title = {Vector Bundle},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {In mathematics, a vector bundle is a topological construction that makes precise the idea of a family of vector spaces parameterized by another space X (for example X could be a topological space, a manifold, or an algebraic variety): to every point x of the space X we associate (or "attach") a vector space V(x) in such a way that these vector spaces fit together to form another space of the same kind as X (e.g. a topological space, manifold, or algebraic variety), which is then called a vector bundle over X.
The simplest example is the case that the family of vector spaces is constant, i.e., there is a fixed vector space V such that V(x) = V for all x in X: in this case there is a copy of V for each x in X and these copies fit together to form the vector bundle X \texttimes{} V over X. Such vector bundles are said to be trivial. A more complicated (and prototypical) class of examples are the tangent bundles of smooth (or differentiable) manifolds: to every point of such a manifold we attach the tangent space to the manifold at that point. Tangent bundles are not, in general, trivial bundles: for example, the tangent bundle of the sphere is non-trivial by the hairy ball theorem. In general, a manifold is said to be parallelizable if and only if its tangent bundle is trivial.
Vector bundles are almost always required to be locally trivial, however, which means they are examples of fiber bundles. Also, the vector spaces are usually required to be over the real or complex numbers, in which case the vector bundle is said to be a real or complex vector bundle (respectively). Complex vector bundles can be viewed as real vector bundles with additional structure. In the following, we focus on real vector bundles in the category of topological spaces.},

  abstract = {In homological algebra in mathematics, the homotopy category K(A) of chain complexes in an additive category A is a framework for working with chain homotopies and homotopy equivalences.  It lies intermediate between the category of chain complexes Kom(A) of A and the derived category D(A) of A when A is abelian; unlike the former it is a triangulated category, and unlike the latter its formation does not require that A is abelian.  Philosophically, while D(A) makes isomorphisms of any maps of complexes that are quasi-isomorphisms in Kom(A), K(A) does so only for those that are quasi-isomorphisms for a "good reason", namely actually having an inverse up to homotopy equivalence.  Thus, K(A) is more understandable than D(A).},

  title = {Computing Simplicial Representatives of Homotopy Group Elements},
  abstract = {A central problem of algebraic topology is to understand the homotopy groups \$\textbackslash{}pi\_d(X)\$ of a topological space \$X\$. For the computational version of the problem, it is well known that there is no algorithm to decide whether the fundamental group \$\textbackslash{}pi\_1(X)\$ of a given finite simplicial complex \$X\$ is trivial. On the other hand, there are several algorithms that, given a finite simplicial complex \$X\$ that is simply connected (i.e., with \$\textbackslash{}pi\_1(X)\$ trivial), compute the higher homotopy group \$\textbackslash{}pi\_d(X)\$ for any given \$d\textbackslash{}geq 2\$. \%The first such algorithm was given by Brown, and more recently, \textbackslash{}v\{C\}adek et al. However, these algorithms come with a caveat: They compute the isomorphism type of \$\textbackslash{}pi\_d(X)\$, \$d\textbackslash{}geq 2\$ as an \textbackslash{}emph\{abstract\} finitely generated abelian group given by generators and relations, but they work with very implicit representations of the elements of \$\textbackslash{}pi\_d(X)\$. Converting elements of this abstract group into explicit geometric maps from the \$d\$-dimensional sphere \$S\^d\$ to \$X\$ has been one of the main unsolved problems in the emerging field of computational homotopy theory. Here we present an algorithm that, given a\textasciitilde{}simply connected space \$X\$, computes \$\textbackslash{}pi\_d(X)\$ and represents its elements as simplicial maps from a suitable triangulation of the \$d\$-sphere \$S\^d\$ to \$X\$. For fixed \$d\$, the algorithm runs in time exponential in \$size(X)\$, the number of simplices of \$X\$. Moreover, we prove that this is optimal: For every fixed \$d\textbackslash{}geq 2\$, we construct a family of simply connected spaces \$X\$ such that for any simplicial map representing a generator of \$\textbackslash{}pi\_d(X)\$, the size of the triangulation of \$S\^d\$ on which the map is defined, is exponential in \$size(X)\$.},

  title = {A Sheaf-Theoretic Model for {{SL}}(2,{{C}}) {{Floer}} Homology},
  abstract = {Given a Heegaard splitting of a three-manifold Y , we consider the SL(2, C) character variety of the Heegaard surface, and two complex Lagrangians associated to the handlebodies. We focus on the smooth open subset corresponding to irreducible representations. On that subset, the intersection of the Lagrangians is an oriented d-critical locus in the sense of Joyce. Bussi associates to such an intersection a perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles. We prove that in our setting, the perverse sheaf is an invariant of Y , i.e., it is independent of the Heegaard splitting. The hypercohomology of the perverse sheaf can be viewed as a model for (the dual of) SL(2, C) instanton Floer homology. We also present a framed version of this construction, which takes into account reducible representations. We give explicit computations for lens spaces and Brieskorn spheres, and discuss the connection to the Kapustin-Witten equations and Khovanov homology.},

  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {In mathematics, Thurston's classification theorem characterizes homeomorphisms of a compact orientable surface.  William Thurston's theorem completes the work initiated by Jakob Nielsen (1944).
Given a homeomorphism f : S {$\rightarrow$} S, there is a map g isotopic to f such that at least one of the following holds:

g is periodic, i.e. some power of g is the identity;
g preserves some finite union of disjoint simple closed curves on S (in this case, g is called reducible); or
g is pseudo-Anosov.The case where S is a torus (i.e., a surface whose genus is one) is handled separately (see torus bundle) and was known before Thurston's work. If the genus of S is two or greater, then S is naturally hyperbolic, and the tools of Teichm\"uller theory become useful.  In what follows, we assume S has genus at least two, as this is the case Thurston considered. (Note, however, that the cases where S has boundary or is not orientable are definitely still of interest.)
The three types in this classification are not mutually exclusive, though a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism is never periodic or reducible.  A reducible homeomorphism g can be further analyzed by cutting the surface along the preserved union of simple closed curves {$\Gamma$}.  Each of the resulting compact surfaces with boundary is acted upon by some power (i.e. iterated composition) of g, and the classification can again be applied to this homeomorphism.},

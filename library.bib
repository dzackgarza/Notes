  abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of classifying pencils of curves of degree \$d\$ in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{P\}\^2\$ using geometric invariant theory. We consider the action of \$SL(3)\$ and we relate the stability of a pencil to the stability of its generators, to the log canonical threshold of its members, and to the multiplicities of its base points, thus obtaining explicit stability criteria.},

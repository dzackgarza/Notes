abstract = {The landscape of homological algebra has evolved over the past half-century into a fundamental tool for the working mathematician. This book provides a unified account of homological algebra as it exists today. The historical connection with topology, regular local rings, and semi-simple Lie algebras is also described. The first half of the book takes as its subject the canonical topics in homological algebra: derived functors, Tor and Ext, projective dimensions and spectral sequences. Homology of group and Lie algebras illustrate these topics. Intermingled are less canonical topics, such as the derived inverse limit functor lim1, local cohomology, Galois cohomology, and affine Lie algebras. The last part of the book covers less traditional topics that are a vital part of the modern homological toolkit: simplicial methods, Hochschild and cyclic homology, derived categories and total derived functors.},

@article{Husemoller1993,
abstract = {manifold. The prototype example for our discussion will be the m{\"{o}}bius band, as it is the simplest example of a nontrivial fiber bundle. We can create the m{\"{o}}bius band by starting with the circle S¹ and (similarly to the case with the cylinder) at each point on the circle attaching a copy of the open interval (0,1), but in a nontrivial manner. Instead of just attaching a bunch of parallel intervals to the circle, our intervals perform a 180° twist as we go around. This gives the manifold a much more interesting geometry. We look at the object we've formed, and note that locally it is indistinguishable from the cylinder. That is, the " twist " in the m{\"{o}}bius band is not located at any particular point on the band; it is entirely a global property of the manifold. Motivated by this example, we seek to generalize the language of product spaces, to include objects like the m{\"{o}}bius band which are only locally a product space. This generalization is what we will come to know as a fiber bundle. Figure 4.2 The mobius band can also be built from a circle and line segment, but using a more general method of construction.},

@article{Vakil2008,
abstract = {Spectral sequences are a powerful book-keeping tool for proving things involving com-plicated commutative diagrams. They were introduced by Leray in the 1940's at the same time as he introduced sheaves. They have a reputation for being abstruse and difficult. It has been suggested that the name 'spectral' was given because, like spectres, spectral sequences are terrifying, evil, and dangerous. I have heard no one disagree with this interpretation, which is perhaps not surprising since I just made it up. Nonetheless, the goal of this note is to tell you enough that you can use spectral se-quences without hesitation or fear, and why you shouldn't be frightened when they come up in a seminar. What is different in this presentation is that we will use spectral sequence to prove things that you may have already seen, and that you can prove easily in other ways. This will allow you to get some hands-on experience for how to use them. We will also see them only in a " special case " of double complexes (which is the version by far the most often used in algebraic geometry), and not in the general form usually presented (filtered complexes, exact couples, etc.). See chapter 5 of Weibel's marvelous book for more detailed information if you wish. If you want to become comfortable with spectral sequences, you must try the exercises. For concreteness, we work in the category vector spaces over a given field. However, everything we say will apply in any abelian category, such as the category Mod A of A-modules.},

abstract = {Since the publication of its first edition, this book has served as one of the few available on the classical Adams spectral sequence, and is the best account on the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. This new edition has been updated in many places, especially the final chapter, which has been completely rewritten with an eye toward future research in the field. It remains the definitive reference on the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The first three chapters introduce the homotopy groups of spheres and take the reader from the classical results in the field though the computational aspects of the classical Adams spectral sequence and its modifications, which are the main tools topologists have to investigate the homotopy groups of spheres. Nowadays, the most efficient tools are the Brown-Peterson theory, the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, and the chromatic spectral sequence, a device for analyzing the global structure of the stable homotopy groups of spheres and relating them to the cohomology of the Morava stabilizer groups. These topics are described in detail in Chapters 4 to 6. The revamped Chapter 7 is the computational payoff of the book, yielding a lot of information about the stable homotopy group of spheres. Appendices follow, giving self-contained accounts of the theory of formal group laws and the homological algebra associated with Hopf algebras and Hopf algebroids. The book is intended for anyone wishing to study computational stable homotopy theory. It is accessible to graduate students with a knowledge of algebraic topology and recommended to anyone wishing to venture into the frontiers of the subject.},

We construct K(G, n) using both CW complexes and classifying spaces. Two proofs are given to the basic fact that cohomology of a CW complex X has 1-1 correspondence with homotopy classes of maps from X into Eilenberg-MacLane spaces: a barehanded proof (original) and a categorical proof using loop spaces. We use it to demonstrate the connection between cohomology operations and cohomology groups of K(G, n)'s. Finally we use the technique of spectral sequence to compute the cohomology of some classes of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, and apply it to the calculation $\pi$ 5 (S 3).},

abstract = {When this book was written, methods of algebraic topology had caused revolutions in the world of pure algebra. To clarify the advances that had been made, Cartan and Eilenberg tried to unify the fields and to construct the framework of a fully fledged theory. The invasion of algebra had occurred on three fronts through the construction of cohomology theories for groups, Lie algebras, and associative algebras. This book presents a single homology (and also cohomology) theory that embodies all three; a large number of results is thus established in a general framework. Subsequently, each of the three theories is singled out by a suitable specialization, and its specific properties are studied.The starting point is the notion of a module over a ring. The primary operations are the tensor product of two modules and the groups of all homomorphisms of one module into another. From these, "higher order" derived of operations are obtained, which enjoy all the properties usually attributed to homology theories. This leads in a natural way to the study of "functors" and of their "derived functors."This mathematical masterpiece will appeal to all mathematicians working in algebraic topology.},

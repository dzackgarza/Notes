In the present paper, we solve the homotopy limit problem for topological Hochschild homology of X(n), which is a generalized version of the Segal Conjecture for the cyclic group of prime order. We prove the same theorem for T (n) under the assumption that T (n) is an E2-ring spectrum. This is also a first step towards computing algebraic K-theory of X(n) and T (n) using trace methods.},

Then we introduce the Fukaya category (informally and without a lot of the necessary technical detail), and briefly discuss algebraic concepts such as exact triangles and generators. Finally, we mention wrapped Fukaya categories and outline a few applications to symplectic topology, mirror symmetry and low-dimensional topology. This text is based on a series of lectures given at a Summer School on Contact and Symplectic Topology at Universit\textbackslash 'e de Nantes in June 2011.},

  pages = {16},
  abstract = {The Grassmannian is a generalization of projective spaces–instead of looking at the set of lines of some vector space, we look at the set of all n-planes. It can be given a manifold structure, and we study the cohomology ring of the Grassmannian manifold in the case that the vector space is complex. The multiplicative structure of the ring is rather complicated and can be computed using the fact that for smooth oriented manifolds, cup product is Poincar´e dual to intersection. There is some nice combinatorial machinery for describing the intersection numbers. This includes the symmetric Schur polynomials, Young tableaux, and the Littlewood-Richardson rule. Sections 1, 2, and 3 introduce notation and the necessary topological tools. Section 4 uses linear algebra to prove Pieri’s formula, which describes the cup product of the cohomology ring in a special case. Section 5 describes the combinatorics and algebra that allow us to deduce all the multiplicative structure of the cohomology ring from Pieri’s formula.},

However, the algebra required can quickly become overwhelming if one starts with the generalized Adams spectral sequence. The classical Adams spectral sequence, in contrast, can be quickly set up and used to do some calculations which would be quite difficult by any other technique. Further, the classical Adams spectral sequence is still a useful calculational and theoretical tool, and is an excellent introduction to the general case.},

The proposal was to attach a (stable) homotopy type to the geometric data given in a version of Floer homology. More to the point, the question was asked, "When is the Floer homology isomorphic to the (singular) homology of a naturally occuring (pro)spectrum defined from the properties of the moduli spaces inherent in the Floer theory?". A proposal for how to construct such a spectrum was given in terms of a "framed flow category", and some rather simple examples were described. Years passed before this notion found some genuine applications to symplectic geometry and low dimensional topology. However in recent years several striking applications have been found, and the theory has been developed on a much deeper level. Here we summarize some of these exciting developments, and describe some of the new techniques that were introduced.

We then analyze algebraic structures of the Hochschild cohomology and describe the relation between deformations and solutions of the corresponding Maurer-Cartan equation. In Section 6 we generalize the Maurer-Cartan equation to strongly homotopy Lie algebras and prove the homotopy invariance of the moduli space of solutions of this equation. In the last section we indicate the main ideas of Kontsevich’s proof of the existence of deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds.},

Many students accept the transform as a Gift From The Gods, but the better students will wonder how anyone could possibly have discovered/developed it. This article outlines a presentation, which offers a plausible (hopefully) progression of thoughts, which leads to integral transforms in general, and the Laplace transform in particular.},

  abstract = {"The study of the mapping class group Mod(S) is a classical topic that is experiencing a renaissance. It lies at the juncture of geometry, topology, and group theory. This book explains as many important theorems, examples, and techniques as possible, quickly and directly, while at the same time giving full details and keeping the text nearly self-contained. The book is suitable for graduate students.The book begins by explaining the main group-theoretical properties of Mod(S), from finite generation by Dehn twists and low-dimensional homology to the Dehn-Nielsen-Baer theorem. Along the way, central objects and tools are introduced, such as the Birman exact sequence, the complex of curves, the braid group, the symplectic representation, and the Torelli group. The book then introduces Teichm©ơller space and its geometry, and uses the action of Mod(S) on it to prove the Nielsen-Thurston classification of surface homeomorphisms. Topics include the topology of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, the connection with surface bundles, pseudo-Anosov theory, and Thurston's approach to the classification"--},

We extend the context of this theory to enumerative problems in algebraic geometry, and consider it as an intrinsic invariant of a finite group. As one application of this point of view, we prove that Hilbert’s 13th Problem, and his Sextic and Octic Conjectures, are equivalent to various enumerative geometry problems, for example problems of finding lines on a smooth cubic surface or bitangents on a smooth planar quartic.},

  title = {{{GEOMETRIC STRUCTURES AND VARIETIES OF REPRESENTATIONS}}},
  author = {Goldman, William M},
  pages = {30},
  abstract = {Many interesting geometric structures on manifolds can be interpreted as structures locally modelled on homogeneous spaces. Given a homogeneous space (X, G) and a manifold M , there is a deformation space of structures on M locally modelled on the geometry of X invariant under G. Such a geometric structure on a manifold M determines a representation (unique up to inner automorphism) of the fundamental group π of M in G. The deformation space for such structures is “locally modelled” on the space Hom(π, G)/G of equivalence classes of representations of π → G. A strong interplay exists between the local and global structure of the variety of representations and the corresponding geometric structures. The lecture in Boulder surveyed some aspects of this correspondence, focusing on: (1) the “Deformation Theorem” relating deformation spaces of geometric structures to the space of representations; (2) representations of surface groups in SL(2; R), hyperbolic structures on surfaces (with singularities), Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates on Teichmu¨ller space; (3) convex real projective structures on surfaces; (4) representations of Schwarz triangle groups in SL(3; C). This paper represents an expanded version of the lecture.},

  abstract = {These are notes on the theory of ∞-categories building on a series of talks given by the author in Warsaw in January, 2010. The aim is to give a non-technical introduction to some of the main ideas of the theory in order to facilitate the digestion of the far more voluminous tomes due to Andre Joyal [Joy08b] and Jacob Lurie [Lur09e] where the theory is developed in full detail. Besides the basic ∞-categorical notions, we mention the Joyal and Bergner model structures which are two approaches to the theory of (∞, 1)-categories. We then treat the theory of (symmetric) monoidal ∞-categories as developed in [Lur09b, Lur09c] and introduce the notion of (commutative) algebra objects. We finish with a summary of Lurie’s treatment of spectra and the smash product from the perspective of ∞-categories [Lur09a] which allows us to give the definition of A∞- and E∞-ring spectra.},

We describe a canonical basis of a cluster algebra determined by tropical counts of holomorphic discs on the mirror variety, using the algebraic approach to the Strominger–Yau–Zaslow conjecture due to Gross and Siebert.},

Taubes has shown that ECH is isomorphic to a version of Seiberg-Witten Floer homology (and both are conjecturally isomorphic to a version of Heegaard Floer homology). This isomorphism allows information to be transferred between topology and contact geometry in three dimensions. In the present article we first give an overview of the definition of embedded contact homology. We then outline its applications to generalizations of the Weinstein conjecture, the Arnold chord conjecture, and obstructions to symplectic embeddings in four dimensions.},

  abstract = {Is speculative mathematics dangerous? Recent interactions between physics and mathematics pose the question with some force: traditional mathematical norms discourage speculation, but it is the fabric of theoretical physics. In practice there can be benefits, but there can also be unpleasant and destructive consequences. Serious caution is required, and the issue should be considered before, rather than after, obvious damage occurs. With the hazards carefully in mind, we propose a framework that should allow a healthy and positive role for speculation.},

  abstract = {These notes give an informal and leisurely introduction to G2 geometry for beginners. A special emphasis is placed on understanding the special linear algebraic structure in 7 dimensions that is the pointwise model for G2 geometry, using the octonions. The basics of G2-structures are introduced, from a Riemannian geometric point of view, including a discussion of the torsion and its relation to curvature for a general G2-structure, as well as the connection to Riemannian holonomy. The history and properties of torsion-free G2 manifolds are considered, and we stress the similarities and differences with Ka¨hler and Calabi-Yau manifolds. The notes end with a brief survey of three important theorems about compact torsion-free G2 manifolds.},

A special emphasis is placed on understanding the special linear algebraic structure in 7 dimensions that is the pointwise model for G2 geometry, using the octonions. The basics of G2-structures are introduced, from a Riemannian geometric point of view, including a discussion of the torsion and its relation to curvature for a general G2-structure, as well as the connection to Riemannian holonomy. The history and properties of torsion-free G2 manifolds are considered, and we stress the similarities and differences with Ka¨hler and Calabi-Yau manifolds. The notes end with a brief survey of three important theorems about compact torsion-free G2 manifolds.},

  pages = {156},
  abstract = {An expository hitchhikers guide to some theorems in mathematics. Criteria for the current list of 172 theorems are whether the result can be formulated elegantly, whether it is beautiful or useful and whether it could serve as a guide [6] without leading to panic. The order is not a ranking but ordered along a time-line when things were written down. Since [349] stated “a mathematical theorem only becomes beautiful if presented as a crown jewel within a context” we try sometimes to give some context. Of course, any such list of theorems is a matter of personal preferences, taste and limitations. The number of theorems is arbitrary, the initial obvious goal was 42 but that number got eventually surpassed as it is hard to stop, once started. As a compensation, there are 42 “tweetable” theorems with included proofs. More comments on the choice of the theorems is included in an epilogue. For literature on general mathematics, see [132, 128, 23, 156, 167, 392, 266, 95], for history [147, 397, 241, 49, 37, 139, 243, 235, 436, 78, 391, 54, 170, 219], for popular, beautiful or elegant things [9, 331, 135, 123, 14, 424, 425, 35, 136, 129, 162, 284, 389, 195, 135, 2, 86, 102, 87, 316]. For comprehensive overviews in large parts of mathematics, [50, 114, 115, 40, 372] or predictions on developments [38]. For reflections about mathematics in general [101, 289, 36, 197, 282, 70, 353].

Examples of this are the braids in a braided monoidal category, and the pentagon which appears in the definitions of both monoidal category and A∞-space.},

Unlike Haiman’s original proof, ours is purely geometric/representation-theoretic and does not use complicated combinatorial arguments. In the proof we show that Procesi bundles on Hilbn(C2) for various n, as constructed by Bezrukavnikov and Kaledin, admit an inductive description via the so called nested Hilbert schemes. Our proof of the latter fact is based on studying quantizations of the nested Hilbert schemes in zero and positive characteristic.},

One can ask how close the map K(A) → K(B)hG is to being an equivalence, i.e., how close algebraic K-theory is to satisfying Galois descent. In joint work with Clausen, Naumann, and Noel, we prove that this map is often an equivalence after telescopic localization. The purpose of these lectures is to outline some of the context of this problem and the ingredients that go into our results.},

  abstract = {To a “stable homotopy theory” (a presentable, symmetric monoidal stable ∞-category), we naturally associate a category of finite étale algebra objects and, using Grothendieck’s categorical machine, a profinite group that we call the Galois group. We then calculate the Galois groups in several examples. For instance, we show that the Galois group of the periodic E∞-algebra of topological modular forms is trivial and that the Galois group of K(n)-local stable homotopy theory is an extended version of the Morava stabilizer group. We also describe the Galois group of the stable module category of a finite group. A fundamental idea throughout is the purely categorical notion of a “descendable” algebra object and an associated analog of faithfully flat descent in this context.},

  abstract = {In mathematics, Thurston's classification theorem characterizes homeomorphisms of a compact orientable surface.  William Thurston's theorem completes the work initiated by Jakob Nielsen (1944). Given a homeomorphism f : S → S, there is a map g isotopic to f such that at least one of the following holds: g is periodic, i.e. some power of g is the identity; g preserves some finite union of disjoint simple closed curves on S (in this case, g is called reducible); or g is pseudo-Anosov.The case where S is a torus (i.e., a surface whose genus is one) is handled separately (see torus bundle) and was known before Thurston's work. If the genus of S is two or greater, then S is naturally hyperbolic, and the tools of Teichmüller theory become useful.  In what follows, we assume S has genus at least two, as this is the case Thurston considered. (Note, however, that the cases where S has boundary or is not orientable are definitely still of interest.) The three types in this classification are not mutually exclusive, though a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism is never periodic or reducible.  A reducible homeomorphism g can be further analyzed by cutting the surface along the preserved union of simple closed curves Γ.  Each of the resulting compact surfaces with boundary is acted upon by some power (i.e. iterated composition) of g, and the classification can again be applied to this homeomorphism.},

  abstract = {These notes were originally developed as lecture notes for a category theory course. They should be well-suited to anyone that wants to learn category theory from scratch and has a scientific mind. There is no need to know advanced mathematics, nor any of the disciplines where category theory is traditionally applied, such as algebraic geometry or theoretical computer science. The only knowledge that is assumed from the reader is linear algebra. All concepts are explained by giving concrete examples from different, non-specialized areas of mathematics (such as basic group theory, graph theory, and probability). Not every example is helpful for every reader, but hopefully every reader can find at least one helpful example per concept. The reader is encouraged to read all the examples, this way they may even learn something new about a different field. Particular emphasis is given to the Yoneda lemma and its significance, with both intuitive explanations, detailed proofs, and specific examples. Another common theme in these notes is the relationship between categories and directed multigraphs, which is treated in detail. From the applied point of view, this shows why categorical thinking can help whenever some process is taking place on a graph. From the pure math point of view, this can be seen as the 1-dimensional first step into the theory of simplicial sets. Finally, monads and comonads are treated on an equal footing, differently to most literature in which comonads are often overlooked as "just the dual to monads". Theorems, interpretations and concrete examples are given for monads as well as for comonads.},

As a first interesting class of examples of such ring spectra we focus on (commutative) algebra spectra over commutative Eilenberg-Mac Lane ring spectra. We present two constructions that yield commutative ring spectra: Thom spectra associated to infinite loop maps and Segal’s construction starting with bipermutative categories. We define topological Hochschild homology, some of its variants, and topological Andr´e-Quillen homology. Obstruction theory for commutative structures on ring spectra is described in two versions. The notion of ´etale extensions in the spectral world is tricky and we explain why. We define Picard groups and Brauer groups of commutative ring spectra and present examples.},

This reader is not presumed to have prior acquaintance with any of these concepts.

  abstract = {We use cluster structures and mirror symmetry to explicitly describe a natural class of Newton-Okounkov bodies for Grassmannians. We consider the Grassmannian \$X=Gr\_\{n-k\}(\textbackslash mathbb C\^n)\$, as well as the mirror dual Landau-Ginzburg model \$(\textbackslash check\{X\}\^\textbackslash circ, W\_q:\textbackslash check\{X\}\^\textbackslash circ \textbackslash to \textbackslash mathbb C)\$, where \$\textbackslash check\{X\}\^\textbackslash circ\$ is the complement of a particular anti-canonical divisor in a Langlands dual Grassmannian \$\textbackslash check\{X\} = Gr\_k((\textbackslash mathbb C\^n)\^*)\$, and the superpotential W\_q has a simple expression in terms of Pl\textbackslash "ucker coordinates. Grassmannians simultaneously have the structure of an \$\textbackslash mathcal\{A\}\$-cluster variety and an \$\textbackslash mathcal\{X\}\$-cluster variety. Given a cluster seed G, we consider two associated coordinate systems: a \$\textbackslash mathcal X\$-cluster chart \$\textbackslash Phi\_G:(\textbackslash mathbb C\^*)\^\{k(n-k)\}\textbackslash to X\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ and a \$\textbackslash mathcal A\$-cluster chart \$\textbackslash Phi\_G\^\{\textbackslash vee\}:(\textbackslash mathbb C\^*)\^\{k(n-k)\}\textbackslash to \textbackslash check\{X\}\^\textbackslash circ\$. To each \$\textbackslash mathcal X\$-cluster chart \$\textbackslash Phi\_G\$ and ample `boundary divisor' \$D\$ in \$X\textbackslash setminus X\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$, we associate a Newton-Okounkov body \$\textbackslash Delta\_G(D)\$ in \$\textbackslash mathbb R\^\{k(n-k)\}\$, which is defined as the convex hull of rational points. On the other hand using the \$\textbackslash mathcal A\$-cluster chart \$\textbackslash Phi\_G\^\{\textbackslash vee\}\$ on the mirror side, we obtain a set of rational polytopes, described by inequalities, by writing the superpotential \$W\_q\$ in the \$\textbackslash mathcal A\$-cluster coordinates, and then "tropicalising". Our main result is that the Newton-Okounkov bodies \$\textbackslash Delta\_G(D)\$ and the polytopes obtained by tropicalisation coincide. As an application, we construct degenerations of the Grassmannian to toric varieties corresponding to these Newton-Okounkov bodies. Additionally, when \$G\$ corresponds to a plabic graph, we give a formula for the lattice points of the Newton-Okounkov bodies, which has an interpretation in terms of quantum Schubert calculus.},

We first explore operads in the category of sets, and then generalize to other familiar categories. Finally, we develop tools to construct operads via generators and relations, and provide several examples of operads in various categories. Throughout, we highlight the ways in which operads can be seen to encode the properties of algebraic structures across different categories.},

This idea was probably first introduced by Quillen and it underlies much of our understanding of complex oriented cohomology theories, exemplified by the work of Morava. Most of the results have close and well-known analogues in the algebro-geometric literature, but with different definitions or technical assumptions that are often inconvenient for topological applications. We merely put everything together in a systematic and convenient way.},

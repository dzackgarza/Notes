In the present paper, we solve the homotopy limit problem for topological Hochschild homology of X(n), which is a generalized version of the Segal Conjecture for the cyclic group of prime order. We prove the same theorem for T (n) under the assumption that T (n) is an E2-ring spectrum. This is also a first step towards computing algebraic K-theory of X(n) and T (n) using trace methods.},

  abstract = {We use cluster structures and mirror symmetry to explicitly describe a natural class of Newton-Okounkov bodies for Grassmannians. We consider the Grassmannian \$X=Gr\_\{n-k\}($\backslash$mathbb C\^n)\$, as well as the mirror dual Landau-Ginzburg model \$($\backslash$check\{X\}\^$\backslash$circ, W\_q:$\backslash$check\{X\}\^$\backslash$circ $\backslash$to $\backslash$mathbb C)\$, where \$$\backslash$check\{X\}\^$\backslash$circ\$ is the complement of a particular anti-canonical divisor in a Langlands dual Grassmannian \$$\backslash$check\{X\} = Gr\_k(($\backslash$mathbb C\^n)\^*)\$, and the superpotential W\_q has a simple expression in terms of Pl$\backslash$"ucker coordinates. Grassmannians simultaneously have the structure of an \$$\backslash$mathcal\{A\}\$-cluster variety and an \$$\backslash$mathcal\{X\}\$-cluster variety. Given a cluster seed G, we consider two associated coordinate systems: a \$$\backslash$mathcal X\$-cluster chart \$$\backslash$Phi\_G:($\backslash$mathbb C\^*)\^\{k(n-k)\}$\backslash$to X\^\{$\backslash$circ\}\$ and a \$$\backslash$mathcal A\$-cluster chart \$$\backslash$Phi\_G\^\{$\backslash$vee\}:($\backslash$mathbb C\^*)\^\{k(n-k)\}$\backslash$to $\backslash$check\{X\}\^$\backslash$circ\$. To each \$$\backslash$mathcal X\$-cluster chart \$$\backslash$Phi\_G\$ and ample ‘boundary divisor' \$D\$ in \$X$\backslash$setminus X\^\{$\backslash$circ\}\$, we associate a Newton-Okounkov body \$$\backslash$Delta\_G(D)\$ in \$$\backslash$mathbb R\^\{k(n-k)\}\$, which is defined as the convex hull of rational points. On the other hand using the \$$\backslash$mathcal A\$-cluster chart \$$\backslash$Phi\_G\^\{$\backslash$vee\}\$ on the mirror side, we obtain a set of rational polytopes, described by inequalities, by writing the superpotential \$W\_q\$ in the \$$\backslash$mathcal A\$-cluster coordinates, and then "tropicalising". Our main result is that the Newton-Okounkov bodies \$$\backslash$Delta\_G(D)\$ and the polytopes obtained by tropicalisation coincide. As an application, we construct degenerations of the Grassmannian to toric varieties corresponding to these Newton-Okounkov bodies. Additionally, when \$G\$ corresponds to a plabic graph, we give a formula for the lattice points of the Newton-Okounkov bodies, which has an interpretation in terms of quantum Schubert calculus.},

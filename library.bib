In our setting, each curve singularity in the family is the image of a parameterization and not the fiber of a morphism. The problem came up in connection with the right-left classification of parameterizations of curve singularities defined over a field of positive characteristic. We prove a bound for right-left determinacy of a parameterization in terms of delta and the semicontinuity theorem provides a simultaneous bound for the determinacy in a family. The fact that the base space can be an arbitrary Noetherian scheme causes some difficulties but is (not only) of interest for computational purposes.},

We show that the Hilbert scheme Hilbd(A∞) is A1-equivalent to the Grassmannian of (d − 1)-planes in A∞. We then describe the A1-homotopy type of Hilbd(An) in a range, for n large compared to d. For example, we compute the integral cohomology of Hilbd(An)(C) in a range. We also deduce that the forgetful map FFlat → Vect from the moduli stack of finite locally free schemes to that of finite locally free sheaves is an A1-equivalence after group completion. This implies that the moduli stack FFlat, viewed as a presheaf with framed transfers, is a model for the effective motivic spectrum kgl representing algebraic K-theory. Combining our techniques with the recent work of Bachmann, we obtain Hilbert scheme models for the kgl-homology of smooth proper schemes over a perfect field.},

  abstract = {Homotopy type theory is a new branch of mathematics, based on a recently discovered connection between homotopy theory and type theory, which brings new ideas into the very foundation of mathematics. On the one hand, Voevodsky's subtle and beautiful "univalence axiom" implies that isomorphic structures can be identified. On the other hand, "higher inductive types" provide direct, logical descriptions of some of the basic spaces and constructions of homotopy theory. Both are impossible to capture directly in classical set-theoretic foundations, but when combined in homotopy type theory, they permit an entirely new kind of "logic of homotopy types". This suggests a new conception of foundations of mathematics, with intrinsic homotopical content, an "invariant" conception of the objects of mathematics -- and convenient machine implementations, which can serve as a practical aid to the working mathematician. This book is intended as a first systematic exposition of the basics of the resulting "Univalent Foundations" program, and a collection of examples of this new style of reasoning -- but without requiring the reader to know or learn any formal logic, or to use any computer proof assistant.},

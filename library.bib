  abstract = {We prove that the rank of the cohomology of a closed symplectic manifold with coefficients in a field of characteristic \$p\$ is smaller than the number of periodic orbits of any non-degenerate Hamiltonian flow. Following Floer, the proof relies on constructing a homology group associated to each such flow, and comparing it with the homology of the ambient symplectic manifold. The proof does not proceed by constructing a version of Floer's complex with characteristic \$p\$ coefficients, but uses instead the canonical (stable) complex orientations of moduli spaces of Floer trajectories to construct a version of Floer homology with coefficients in Morava's \$K\$-theories, and can thus be seen as an implementation of Cohen, Jones, and Segal's vision for a Floer homotopy theory. The key feature of Morava K-theory that allows the construction to be carried out is the fact that the corresponding homology and cohomology groups of classifying spaces of finite groups satisfy Poincar\textbackslash 'e duality.},

  abstract = {The Univalence Principle is the statement that equivalent mathematical structures are indistinguishable. We prove a general version of this principle that applies to all set-based, categorical, and higher-categorical structures defined in a non-algebraic and space-based style, as well as models of higher-order theories such as topological spaces. In particular, we formulate a general definition of indiscernibility for objects of any such structure, and a corresponding univalence condition that generalizes Rezk's completeness condition for Segal spaces and ensures that all equivalences of structures are levelwise equivalences. Our work builds on Makkai's First-Order Logic with Dependent Sorts, but is expressed in Voevodsky's Univalent Foundations (UF), extending previous work on the Structure Identity Principle and univalent categories in UF. This enables indistinguishability to be expressed simply as identification, and yields a formal theory that is interpretable in classical homotopy theory, but also in other higher topos models. It follows that Univalent Foundations is a fully equivalence-invariant foundation for higher-categorical mathematics, as intended by Voevodsky.},

To any such object satisfying an abstract analog of the Cartier isomorphism, an elementary homological process associates a generalization of the de Rham–Witt construction. Abstractly, the homological algebra can be viewed as a calculation of the fixed points of the Berthelot–Ogus operator Lηp on the p-complete derived category. We give various applications of this approach, including a simplification of the crystalline comparison for the AΩ-cohomology theory introduced in [BMS18].},

The first construction is via a "bootstrap" method from the algebraic stack of vector bundles on an algebraic curve. This construction is motivated in part by Nitsure's GIT construction of a projective moduli space of semi-stable Higgs bundles, and we describe the relationship between Nitsure's moduli space and the algebraic stacks constructed here. The third approach is via deformation theory, where we directly construct the stack of Higgs bundles using Artin's criterion.},

We prove a bound for right-left determinacy of a parameterization in terms of delta and the semicontinuity theorem provides a simultaneous bound for the determinacy in a family.

We show that the Hilbert scheme Hilbd(A∞) is A1-equivalent to the Grassmannian of (d − 1)-planes in A∞. We then describe the A1-homotopy type of Hilbd(An) in a range, for n large compared to d. For example, we compute the integral cohomology of Hilbd(An)(C) in a range. We also deduce that the forgetful map FFlat → Vect from the moduli stack of finite locally free schemes to that of finite locally free sheaves is an A1-equivalence after group completion. This implies that the moduli stack FFlat, viewed as a presheaf with framed transfers, is a model for the effective motivic spectrum kgl representing algebraic K-theory. Combining our techniques with the recent work of Bachmann, we obtain Hilbert scheme models for the kgl-homology of smooth proper schemes over a perfect field.},

  abstract = {Homotopy type theory is a new branch of mathematics, based on a recently discovered connection between homotopy theory and type theory, which brings new ideas into the very foundation of mathematics. On the one hand, Voevodsky's subtle and beautiful "univalence axiom" implies that isomorphic structures can be identified. On the other hand, "higher inductive types" provide direct, logical descriptions of some of the basic spaces and constructions of homotopy theory. Both are impossible to capture directly in classical set-theoretic foundations, but when combined in homotopy type theory, they permit an entirely new kind of "logic of homotopy types". This suggests a new conception of foundations of mathematics, with intrinsic homotopical content, an "invariant" conception of the objects of mathematics -- and convenient machine implementations, which can serve as a practical aid to the working mathematician. This book is intended as a first systematic exposition of the basics of the resulting "Univalent Foundations" program, and a collection of examples of this new style of reasoning -- but without requiring the reader to know or learn any formal logic, or to use any computer proof assistant.},

  title = {The {{Segal Conjecture}} for Topological {{Hochschild}} Homology of the {{Ravenel}} Spectra \${{X}}(n)\$ and \${{T}}(n)\$},
  abstract = {In [27], Ravenel introduced sequences of spectra X(n) and T (n) which played an important role in the proof of the Nilpotence Theorem of Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith [11]. In the present paper, we solve the homotopy limit problem for topological Hochschild homology of X(n), which is a generalized version of the Segal Conjecture for the cyclic group of prime order. We prove the same theorem for T (n) under the assumption that T (n) is an E2-ring spectrum. This is also a first step towards computing algebraic K-theory of X(n) and T (n) using trace methods.},

  title = {Classification of fibre Bundles, Gauge Theory and {{D}}-Branes},
  abstract = {These notes are aimed at students and young researchers in string and field theory with some working knowledge of manifold theory, but only a rough idea of what fibre bundles are. The aim is to introduce some notions from fibre bundle theory and algebraic topology (mainly homotopy theory) and build up to some results about the classification of principal and vector bundles that are relevant for the understanding of for instance topologically nontrivial solutions and anomalies in gauge theories, and D-branes in string theory. After laying the necessary groundwork, the first goal is the Chern-Weil approach to characteristic classes starting from the theory of connections on principal bundles. Then a more abstract approach to classifying vector bundles using homotopy theory results in the very basics of topological K-theory. These notes are intended to be quite basic, but should provide readers with the necessary background for understanding more serious accounts of such things as index theory, (twisted) K-theory and their applications to theoretical physics.},

  abstract = {We consider families of parameterizations of reduced curve singularities over a Noetherian base scheme and prove that the delta invariant is semicontinuous. In our setting, each curve singularity in the family is the image of a parameterization and not the fiber of a morphism. The problem came up in connection with the right-left classification of parameterizations of curve singularities defined over a field of positive characteristic. We prove a bound for right-left determinacy of a parameterization in terms of delta and the semicontinuity theorem provides a simultaneous bound for the determinacy in a family. The fact that the base space can be an arbitrary Noetherian scheme causes some difficulties but is (not only) of interest for computational purposes.},

In this work, we present algorithms to compute the Serre spectral system leveraging the effective homology technique, which allows to perform computations involving infinitely generated chain complexes associated with interesting objects in algebraic topology. In order to develop the programs, implemented as a new module for the Computer Algebra system Kenzo, we translated the original construction of the Serre spectral system in a simplicial framework and studied some of its fundamental properties.},

The original source for the ideas presented here is the “HoTT Book” – Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics published by The Univalent Foundations Program, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. In what follows we freely borrow and adapt definitions, arguments and proofs from the HoTT Book throughout without always giving a specific citation.1 However, whereas that book provides an introduction to the subject that rapidly involves the reader in advanced technical material, the exposition in this Primer is more gently paced for the beginner. We also do more to motivate, justify, and explain some aspects of the theory in greater detail, and we address foundational and philosophical issues that the HoTT Book does not.},

  abstract = {Homotopy type theory is a new branch of mathematics, based on a recently discovered connection between homotopy theory and type theory, which brings new ideas into the very foundation of mathematics. On the one hand, Voevodsky's subtle and beautiful "univalence axiom" implies that isomorphic structures can be identified. On the other hand, "higher inductive types" provide direct, logical descriptions of some of the basic spaces and constructions of homotopy theory. Both are impossible to capture directly in classical set-theoretic foundations, but when combined in homotopy type theory, they permit an entirely new kind of "logic of homotopy types". This suggests a new conception of foundations of mathematics, with intrinsic homotopical content, an "invariant" conception of the objects of mathematics -- and convenient machine implementations, which can serve as a practical aid to the working mathematician. This book is intended as a first systematic exposition of the basics of the resulting "Univalent Foundations" program, and a collection of examples of this new style of reasoning -- but without requiring the reader to know or learn any formal logic, or to use any computer proof assistant.},

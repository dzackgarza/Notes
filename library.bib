  abstract = {We consider families of parameterizations of reduced curve singularities over a Noetherian base scheme and prove that the delta invariant is semicontinuous. In our setting, each curve singularity in the family is the image of a parameterization and not the fiber of a morphism. The problem came up in connection with the right-left classification of parameterizations of curve singularities defined over a field of positive characteristic. We prove a bound for right-left determinacy of a parameterization in terms of delta and the semicontinuity theorem provides a simultaneous bound for the determinacy in a family. The fact that the base space can be an arbitrary Noetherian scheme causes some difficulties but is (not only) of interest for computational purposes.},

  abstract = {The Serre spectral system associated with a tower of fibrations represents a generalization of the classical Serre spectral sequence of a fibration. In this work, we present algorithms to compute the Serre spectral system leveraging the effective homology technique, which allows to perform computations involving infinitely generated chain complexes associated with interesting objects in algebraic topology. In order to develop the programs, implemented as a new module for the Computer Algebra system Kenzo, we translated the original construction of the Serre spectral system in a simplicial framework and studied some of its fundamental properties.},

Therefore, they are accessible to a mathematician of any speciality willing to understand the subject. A much more complete introduction to K-theory may be found in the "Handbook of K-theory", recently edited by Springer.},
